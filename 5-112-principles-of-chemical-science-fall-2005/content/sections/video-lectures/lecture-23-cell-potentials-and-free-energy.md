  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Today I will begin by
  talking about a subject that we were</span> <span m='21000'>just getting to at the
  end of class last time,</span> <span m='26000'>and that will be electrolysis. And
  this is an interesting</span> <span m='32000'>topic. One of the examples of</span>
  <span m='35000'>electrolysis that is commonly used is that which forms the</span>
  <span m='40000'>basis for the so-called Dow process.</span> </p><p><span m='70000'>Here,
  what I am representing is a container.</span> </p><p><span m='74000'>And a container
  that would be used to house molten magnesium</span> <span m='80000'>chloride. If
  you take magnesium chloride,</span> <span m='85000'>which is a typical salt, and
  get it hot enough,</span> <span m='89000'>then it will become liquid. And when it
  becomes liquid in</span> <span m='95000'>the melt, what you can do is carry out
  a non-spontaneous</span> <span m='101000'>reaction by applying an external voltage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='105000'>So, the idea is that this is some source of a potential</span>
  <span m='110000'>difference. And you can take a positive</span> <span m='114000'>electrode
  and a negative electrode and immerse it into</span> <span m='119000'>the melt. And
  if the potential is</span> <span m='124000'>sufficiently great, you can force a
  non-spontaneous</span> <span m='128000'>reaction to run, because overall,</span>
  <span m='131000'>the reaction will be spontaneous when you factor in</span> <span
  m='136000'>the potential difference of the external source.</span> </p><p><span
  m='141000'>And, in this particular case, the reaction that would be</span> <span
  m='146000'>taking place is as follows. At one side we would have</span> <span m='152000'>magnesium
  two plus ions being reduced to,</span> <span m='157000'>at this temperature, liquid
  elemental magnesium.</span> </p><p><span m='162000'>So, metallic magnesium at one
  electrode.</span> </p><p><span m='166000'>And, at the same time, at the other electrode,</span>
  <span m='171000'>what would be taking place is the oxidation of chloride ions,</span>
  <span m='177000'>two of which counterbalance the magnesium two plus</span> <span
  m='183000'>in the salt magnesium dichloride.</span> </p><p><span m='188000'>And
  we put in a couple of electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='190000'>Sorry, we are oxidizing
  chloride to Cl two,</span> <span m='193000'>which would be bubbling out as a gas
  at the temperatures of</span> <span m='197000'>this melt. You initially would have
  this</span> <span m='200000'>molten salt. You would immerse your two</span> <span
  m='202000'>electrodes. You would apply an external</span> <span m='205000'>potential.
  And if that potential is great</span> <span m='208000'>enough, then these two reactions
  start taking place at the two</span> <span m='212000'>electrodes. And you can see
  that in order</span> <span m='216000'>for this to happen, chloride is being oxidized.</span>
  </p><p><span m='220000'>And so we can see then that this must be the source of the</span>
  <span m='224000'>positive electrode and electrons will be going this way and going</span>
  <span m='230000'>down here. And when they collect in this</span> <span m='233000'>electrode
  on the left, they are used to reduce</span> <span m='236000'>magnesium two plus
  to liquid magnesium.</span> </p><p><span m='242000'>So, that is an electrolysis
  reaction in which something that</span> <span m='246000'>does not want to happen,
  namely the reduction of</span> <span m='249000'>magnesium two plus to magnesium
  zero by chloride</span> <span m='253000'>ions, that is non-spontaneous. And we are
  forcing it to happen</span> <span m='258000'>by applying this external potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='260000'>And just how great must that external potential be?</span>
  </p><p><span m='265000'>Well, Christine, could you locate for me on the</span> <span
  m='269000'>table, there, the potential for magnesium two</span> <span m='273000'>plus
  plus two electrons going to magnesium</span> <span m='279000'>and the potential
  for Cl two plus two electrons going</span> <span m='284000'>to two Cl minus?</span>
  </p><p><span m='288000'>Note that our standard potentials that we defined last</span>
  <span m='293000'>time, relative to the standard hydrogen electrode,</span> <span
  m='298000'>are always written as reduction potentials by convention.</span> </p><p><span
  m='305000'>What is it here? Can we zoom in on it?</span> </p><p><span m='312000'>Zoom
  in our finger.</span> </p><p><span m='323000'>Okay. By the way, I had her do this</span>
  <span m='325000'>in part because I wanted to draw your attention to this table</span>
  <span m='328000'>that is in one of the appendices of the textbook.</span> </p><p><span
  m='332000'>So, it is in the back. There is an abbreviated form of</span> <span m='335000'>this
  table right in Chapter 12, which you should be reading.</span> </p><p><span m='340000'>But
  when you want to find a standard potential that is not</span> <span m='344000'>in
  that abbreviated table, you will now know that you can</span> <span m='348000'>go
  to your appendix to find that reduction potential.</span> </p><p><span m='351000'>Christine,
  please read out to me the value for the chloride.</span> </p><p><span m='356000'>Is
  that the one that you have there?</span> </p><p><span m='358000'>+1.36. Okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m='360000'>And this is positive of the standard hydrogen electrode,</span>
  <span m='364000'>showing you that Cl two is an oxidizing substance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='369000'>And then what about the magnesium plus two</span> <span m='373000'>electrons?
  -2.36.</span> </p><p><span m='374000'>Remember I mentioned last time that elemental
  sodium was around</span> <span m='379000'>-2.7 volts, so it was a very strong reducing
  agent,</span> <span m='383000'>magnesium. It is also a very strong</span> <span
  m='385000'>reducing agent. Chlorine is an oxidant,</span> <span m='389000'>so clearly
  the direction of spontaneity in this system is</span> <span m='393000'>for a magnesium
  metal to be reducing Cl two to make</span> <span m='398000'>chloride ions. And that
  is why the form of the</span> <span m='401000'>salt that Henry Dow as a young man
  was extracting from the</span> <span m='406000'>briny marshes near his home in Michigan,
  and later founded the</span> <span m='410000'>Dow company on the basis of chemistries
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='414000'>That is how you found it, as magnesium
  two plus,</span> <span m='418000'>2 Cl minus. And so, overall,</span> <span m='421000'>if
  you reverse the sign of the anode reaction and add it to the</span> <span m='426000'>cathode
  reaction, you are going to see that this</span> <span m='431000'>one is downhill,
  sorry, is non-spontaneous by an</span> <span m='435000'>absolute magnitude of 3.72
  volts, which is the difference</span> <span m='440000'>between these two values,
  this absolute difference in</span> <span m='445000'>potential. That means that we
  are going to</span> <span m='449000'>have to apply an external voltage of greater
  than 3.72</span> <span m='453000'>volts, positive, in order to get this thing to</span>
  <span m='456000'>run and to be able to get gaseous Cl two bubbling</span> <span
  m='461000'>out and in order to get liquid molten magnesium to be formed</span> <span
  m='465000'>and separating from the molten magnesium chloride.</span> </p><p><span
  m='469000'>That is a large external potential.</span> </p><p><span m='471000'>That
  is the price that you have to pay to make this</span> <span m='475000'>non-spontaneous
  reaction go. And that is the minimum price.</span> </p><p><span m='482000'>If we
  could just briefly switch to the Athena from the document</span> <span m='489000'>camera.
  I want to mention this one</span> <span m='493000'>word, overpotential.</span> </p><p><span
  m='503000'>You will see an explicit definition of the word</span> <span m='507000'>overpotential
  given in my notes and in your book,</span> <span m='512000'>but what overpotential
  is, in fact, a number.</span> </p><p><span m='517000'>And it is the amount of voltage
  that is greater than this</span> <span m='520000'>non-spontaneous cell potential
  that you have to apply in order</span> <span m='525000'>for the reaction really
  to start kicking in and working.</span> </p><p><span m='528000'>In practice, you
  choose maybe a couple</span> <span m='531000'>platinum electrodes, and you dip them
  into the thing</span> <span m='534000'>that you want to electrolyze, and you apply
  an external</span> <span m='538000'>potential. And, in practice,</span> <span m='541000'>that
  external potential is something much greater than the</span> <span m='545000'>cell
  voltage of interest. And sometimes it is even a</span> <span m='548000'>large amount
  in excess. And the reason has to do with</span> <span m='552000'>the barrier to
  the reaction, that is introduced by the way</span> <span m='556000'>that it takes
  place at the interface on the surface of</span> <span m='560000'>these electrodes,
  so you have to apply some</span> <span m='563000'>overpotential. That is energy
  that you have to</span> <span m='567000'>put into the system over and above the
  inherent energy of the</span> <span m='571000'>electrolysis to make it actually
  work in practice.</span> </p><p><span m='575000'>And so, the substance that we would
  most like to be able to</span> <span m='580000'>electrolyze is water. Because, if
  you think about it,</span> <span m='584000'>electrolysis of water would produce
  hydrogen and oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='588000'>And then we could have those
  in our fuel tank,</span> <span m='591000'>and we can go ahead and let combustion
  take place,</span> <span m='595000'>which produces what? It would produce water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='600000'>You would get a beautiful complete cycle,</span> <span m='602000'>if
  you could do a good job of electrolyzing water into its</span> <span m='606000'>components,
  H two and O two.</span> </p><p><span m='609000'>And the reason that that is difficult
  is because you have to</span> <span m='613000'>put in energy, somehow, in order
  to make that</span> <span m='617000'>non-spontaneous reaction go uphill.</span>
  </p><p><span m='619000'>We would like to make that the basis for the hydrogen economy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='623000'>I really love Iceland. This is my favorite country,</span>
  <span m='627000'>I think. Although, I have never been</span> <span m='630000'>there.
  And it is, because they do this</span> <span m='632000'>reaction. They do this electrolysis
  of</span> <span m='635000'>water every night, so that they will have hydrogen</span>
  <span m='638000'>and oxygen for combustion purposes the next day in their</span>
  <span m='641000'>buses in the city. And they are actually doing</span> <span m='644000'>this.
  And why are they able to do</span> <span m='646000'>that? Well, their special location
  on</span> <span m='648000'>the planet gives them a lot of free electricity that
  they can</span> <span m='652000'>use to run the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen
  and</span> <span m='655000'>oxygen every night. And then they can combust that</span>
  <span m='659000'>in their buses. And you essentially have free</span> <span m='662000'>hydrogen,
  and it is not a problem.</span> </p><p><span m='665000'>And in places like Iceland
  or other places in the world,</span> <span m='668000'>where you have freely available
  energy from geothermal sources</span> <span m='672000'>or from hydroelectric power,
  then you can do that.</span> </p><p><span m='676000'>You can use that energy, that
  electricity that is free,</span> <span m='679000'>that the earth is just giving
  you, to go ahead and carry out</span> <span m='683000'>the electrolysis of water
  and make hydrogen that way.</span> </p><p><span m='688000'>And we would like to
  be able to do that using photochemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='694000'>One possible
  way to get the positive holes in the electrons</span> <span m='699000'>apart is
  to use h nu. A photon can impinge on a</span> <span m='704000'>material and lead
  to the separation of charge in what is</span> <span m='710000'>called a photovoltaic
  device. And, if you can interface a</span> <span m='716000'>photovoltaic device
  to a couple of electrodes that have surfaces</span> <span m='720000'>that are appropriate,
  chemically, for minimizing the</span> <span m='724000'>overpotential, then you can
  use light coming</span> <span m='728000'>in from the sun to make electrolysis of
  water happen to</span> <span m='732000'>get hydrogen and oxygen from light that
  is coming in incident</span> <span m='736000'>on the earth. And so, one thing that
  is</span> <span m='739000'>currently ongoing research in a partnership at Caltech
  and MIT,</span> <span m='744000'>and I am involved with this, this is Professor
  Nocera,</span> <span m='748000'>here. And you will see this furry</span> <span m='751000'>face
  walking around the hallways at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='754000'>And he is an
  amazing guy. And if he does what he is</span> <span m='758000'>trying to do right,
  he is probably going to be the</span> <span m='762000'>next one in our department
  to win the Nobel Prize.</span> </p><p><span m='765000'>So, Professor Nocera is currently
  the professor of</span> <span m='769000'>chemistry and professor of energy here
  at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='772000'>He is the energy professor. And he is a lot
  more voluble</span> <span m='776000'>and vigorous, I think, than I am.</span> </p><p><span
  m='780000'>He is really bouncing off the walls with energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='783000'>And that is good because the technical challenges that we</span> <span
  m='787000'>have to surmount in order to be able to use sunlight to carry</span>
  <span m='791000'>out water oxidation, water electrolysis are very</span> <span m='794000'>great,
  but they come down to chemistry and to molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='798000'>And
  starting on Wednesday, we are going to enter a part of</span> <span m='801000'>the
  semester in which we treat the subject of bonding in</span> <span m='805000'>chemistry
  in quite a bit of detail.</span> </p><p><span m='809000'>We are going to be talking
  about molecular orbitals and</span> <span m='812000'>things like that. And if you
  get a good</span> <span m='814000'>understanding of molecular orbital theory and
  electronic</span> <span m='818000'>structure and the shapes of molecules, you may
  be able to</span> <span m='821000'>contribute to this problem by helping to design
  molecules that</span> <span m='825000'>can go on the surface of the electrodes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='827000'>And the purpose of those molecules is to reduce the</span>
  <span m='831000'>overpotential for water electrolysis with sunlight as</span> <span
  m='834000'>the source of the electrons and the holes.</span> </p><p><span m='838000'>And
  this man's entire life is defined by one number,</span> <span m='842000'>and that
  is the overpotential. We are making electrode</span> <span m='846000'>molecules
  that will bring down the overpotential and give us a</span> <span m='850000'>free
  source of clean energy from water.</span> </p><p><span m='853000'>One week from
  today, you are going to have a little</span> <span m='857000'>introduction to undergraduate
  research here at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='861000'>We are going to have some visitors
  who will come in and</span> <span m='866000'>talk to you about the 5 subject that
  is given during</span> <span m='870000'>IAP. And the people who successfully</span>
  <span m='874000'>complete the 5.301 subject are then guaranteed a position in a</span>
  <span m='878000'>research laboratory in chemistry as an undergraduate research</span>
  <span m='883000'>opportunities program student. If you want to get involved in</span>
  <span m='887000'>the molecular chemistry of renewable energy,</span> <span m='891000'>then
  you might want to make sure you are here on time for</span> <span m='895000'>class
  on Monday, and you will get that</span> <span m='898000'>introduction. And you can
  think about what to</span> <span m='902000'>do in terms of 5.301. Now, I want to
  bring you up to</span> <span m='907000'>speed on some more important concepts that
  pertain to</span> <span m='912000'>electrochemistry. Let's talk about electrical</span>
  <span m='916000'>work.</span> </p><p><span m='933000'>Here, I want to make an analogy
  to the way that electrons can do</span> <span m='938000'>work when they fall through
  a potential difference and</span> <span m='942000'>experience a potential difference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='945000'>I want to make an analogy between that and the way that</span>
  <span m='949000'>things go downhill by virtue of the force of gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='955000'>And so, you can think of a waterfall of electrons flowing</span> <span
  m='960000'>from a place of high potential to a place of low potential if</span>
  <span m='965000'>you want to get an idea for our expression for the way that the</span>
  <span m='971000'>free energy of reaction is related to electrical work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='975000'>And it is the total charge that is passed multiplied by the</span> <span
  m='980000'>potential difference through which the charge is passing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='992000'>We have been talking about this potential difference and calling</span>
  <span m='997000'>it E. And if it is standard</span> <span m='999000'>potential,
  then we will use the superscript zero,</span> <span m='1003000'>or the little degree
  symbol for a standard.</span> </p><p><span m='1007000'>And now, we want to know
  what is the total charge?</span> </p><p><span m='1011000'>It is going to be negative
  n times the charge on the electron</span> <span m='1016000'>times N sub A, which
  is Avogadro's number.</span> </p><p><span m='1022000'>And we are going to be interested
  in getting the total</span> <span m='1026000'>charge expressed in terms of a quantity
  per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1030000'>Actually, we are going to express it in
  Coulombs per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1035000'>And so, we combine e and (N)A
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>And this is one of our fundamental constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1042000'>This is Faraday's constant. And you will remember that
  that</span> <span m='1050000'>is approximately 96,485.3 Coulombs per mole.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1057000'>That is Faraday's constant. And we will use that as our
  way</span> <span m='1065000'>of expressing charge here. And so, we get the important</span>
  <span m='1073000'>expression, delta Gr is equal to negative nFE.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1080000'>And we will use that a couple</span> <span m='1087000'>of times today
  in getting access to other quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='1092000'>And what
  is n? That is going to be the</span> <span m='1095000'>stoichiometric number of
  electrons passed in the</span> <span m='1099000'>half-reaction of interest. I will
  show you a couple of</span> <span m='1103000'>examples of how you figure out what
  n is in this expression.</span> </p><p><span m='1110000'>So, it is the total charge
  times the potential difference.</span> </p><p><span m='1116000'>One of the things
  that this is useful for is for finding a</span> <span m='1122000'>relationship between
  an equilibrium constant and a</span> <span m='1127000'>standard cell potential.
  And we can do that by recalling</span> <span m='1132000'>from chemical equilibrium
  the expression that delta G is equal</span> <span m='1139000'>to minus RT ln K.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1145000'>And now we have a new expression, down here,</span> <span
  m='1152000'>for delta G. And let's go ahead and insert</span> <span m='1158000'>that,
  and we will see that nFE is going to be equal to RT ln K.</span> </p><p><span m='1170000'>And
  so, we can just rearrange that and solve for quantity of</span> <span m='1175000'>interest
  here. We are going to see that the</span> <span m='1179000'>equilibrium constant,
  K, is equal to an exponential</span> <span m='1184000'>of nFE divided by RT. And</span>
  <span m='1189000'>this should be for a standard potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1193000'>And
  then this is the equilibrium constant,</span> <span m='1197000'>that special value
  of Q that applies when the system is at</span> <span m='1202000'>equilibrium. So,
  let me put the little</span> <span m='1206000'>superscript up here to make it clear
  that we are talking here</span> <span m='1211000'>about a standard potential. The
  idea is then if you have a</span> <span m='1216000'>reaction and you can express
  it in terms of half-reactions,</span> <span m='1220000'>then you can go to our table
  in the appendix,</span> <span m='1224000'>if those half-reactions happen to be in
  the table.</span> </p><p><span m='1229000'>And then you can calculate the value
  of the standard potential</span> <span m='1233000'>for the cell that would be comprised
  of those two</span> <span m='1237000'>half-reactions, as we described last time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1240000'>And then, given these other quantities, we can calculate
  the</span> <span m='1245000'>equilibrium constant for the reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1248000'>So, it is a useful thing to be able to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1251000'>You
  take a standard cell potential and then take a</span> <span m='1254000'>temperature
  like the standard temperature, 298.15K.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>And you
  have your value of F that I gave you.</span> </p><p><span m='1263000'>And you can
  look up, of course, the value for the</span> <span m='1266000'>gas constant. And
  you have n,</span> <span m='1268000'>from the stoichiometry of the number of electrons
  passing</span> <span m='1272000'>through this potential difference.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1274000'>And then you can get K. And you see that this</span> <span m='1277000'>equilibrium
  constant K goes up exponentially as the standard</span> <span m='1281000'>cell potential
  increases. That is quite an interesting</span> <span m='1285000'>relationship, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1286000'>And I would like to give you an example of how we can use
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='1300000'>Let's consider a possible reaction of this
  sort.</span> </p><p><span m='1310000'>This reaction, of course, as you would see
  in</span> <span m='1312000'>the table of standard reduction potentials, is assumed
  to be</span> <span m='1317000'>taking place in dilute aqueous solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1320000'>Actually, if it is in a standard state,</span> <span m='1322000'>the
  concentrations of the ions will be taken to be 1.0 molar,</span> <span m='1327000'>which
  is the standard concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='1329000'>One thing that I
  regret about my lecture on Friday and about</span> <span m='1333000'>my lecture
  today is that I am not really talking too much</span> <span m='1337000'>about molecules
  and molecular shapes and what these things</span> <span m='1341000'>actually look
  like in solution. But normally,</span> <span m='1345000'>when you have metal or
  metalloid ions dissolved in</span> <span m='1348000'>aqueous solution, there is
  some number of water</span> <span m='1351000'>molecules that are interacting directly
  with the metal ions.</span> </p><p><span m='1355000'>It is just not a so-called
  naked metal ion,</span> <span m='1357000'>but it is bonded to water molecules in
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1360000'>And this is through the type of Lewis
  acid, Lewis base chemistry</span> <span m='1364000'>that we talked about earlier.
  There would really be some</span> <span m='1367000'>number of water molecules bonded
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1371000'>And we will look at so-called coordination
  complexes in quite</span> <span m='1375000'>a bit more detail in the upcoming section
  on chemical</span> <span m='1380000'>bonding, but this is how you will find it typically
  written</span> <span m='1384000'>in a book. And that is not representative</span>
  <span m='1387000'>of the structure in solution, which you do need to know in</span>
  <span m='1392000'>order to have a little bit of an understanding of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1397000'>And we are going to consider the possibility that indium
  may</span> <span m='1402000'>react with uranium to provide indium two plus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1408000'>We are going from trivalent to divalent indium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1411000'>And the source of that electron is the uranium three plus</span>
  <span m='1415000'>ion going to the uranium four plus ion.</span> </p><p><span m='1419000'>There
  is a hypothetical</span> <span m='1421000'>reaction that we want to consider.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1423000'>And we are going to need to be able to express that in
  terms of</span> <span m='1428000'>half-reactions.</span> </p><p><span m='1435000'>And
  one of these half-reactions is simply indium two plus</span> <span m='1441000'>plus
  the electron. Sorry, indium three plus plus</span> <span m='1448000'>an electron
  going to indium two plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1454000'>And, similarly,</span>
  <span m='1456000'>over here, we have uranium three plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1460000'>I
  am writing both of these as reductions, as you will find</span> <span m='1467000'>them
  in the table. Four plus, plus an electron,</span> <span m='1473000'>going to uranium
  three plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1479000'>Those are our two half-reactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1482000'>Christine, can you zero in on them?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1486000'>Yes, you are doing that already.</span> </p><p><span m='1489000'>Thank
  you. -0.49 for indium.</span> </p><p><span m='1492000'>And then, when we look at
  uranium, these are arranged</span> <span m='1497000'>alphabetically.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1507000'>Here they are in alphabetical order.</span> </p><p><span m='1510000'>In
  the tables they can be arranged by potential or they</span> <span m='1515000'>can
  be arranged alphabetically. Sometimes it is easier to find</span> <span m='1521000'>a
  potential by taking advantage of alphabetization.</span> </p><p><span m='1525000'>And
  so, if we can focus in on that --</span> <span m='1530000'>We focus in on that,
  and you will see that the 4+</span> <span m='1534000'>going to the 3+ is -0.61.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1542000'>And then you will remember that to find the standard cell</span>
  <span m='1548000'>potential, E zero of the cell is going to be equal to E</span>
  <span m='1555000'>zero of the cathode minus E zero of the anode.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1566000'>And what we can see here is that this reaction is going to</span> <span
  m='1570000'>proceed spontaneously as written because in going from left to</span>
  <span m='1574000'>right, as written, uranium plus three is going to</span> <span
  m='1578000'>plus four. So, uranium is the reducing</span> <span m='1582000'>agent.
  And it is a stronger reducing</span> <span m='1584000'>agent than the other possible
  reducing agent,</span> <span m='1588000'>indium two plus, because it is more negative</span>
  <span m='1592000'>than the indium two plus. And how much more negative is</span>
  <span m='1598000'>it? It is more negative by +0.12</span> <span m='1601000'>volts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1608000'>And we, therefore, because this cell potential is</span>
  <span m='1611000'>positive, we know that this reaction is spontaneous as</span>
  <span m='1616000'>written. And it is positive by 0.12</span> <span m='1619000'>volts.
  That is a spontaneous reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1622000'>And now we have
  all the information that we would need</span> <span m='1627000'>in order to get
  the equilibrium constant for this reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1631000'>We know
  that, in terms of standard potential,</span> <span m='1635000'>it is 0.12. Let's
  see, here,</span> <span m='1637000'>if we can just calculate this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1685000'>All right. I am going to take this and</span> <span m='1688000'>zoom
  it a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1707000'>We are going to put in Faraday's
  constant of 96,485.3,</span> <span m='1717000'>and also we are going to need the
  gas constant.</span> </p><p><span m='1726000'>Everyone remember the value of the
  gas constant,</span> <span m='1735000'>8.31447? And now, if we look over at our</span>
  <span m='1740000'>relationship between the equilibrium constant and the</span> <span
  m='1745000'>free energy over there. We took a free energy and we</span> <span m='1750000'>converted
  it into a standard cell potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1753000'>Now we have it,
  so we want to solve for an</span> <span m='1757000'>exponential of nFE. n is one
  here because,</span> <span m='1761000'>in both cases, we have one electron being</span>
  <span m='1764000'>transferred in the half-reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1769000'>We
  have the exponential of F times 0.12.</span> </p><p><span m='1776000'>And then,
  that is divided by RT.</span> </p><p><span m='1780000'>And so we have R times 298.15
  K.</span> </p><p><span m='1785000'>And let me just make sure I get back over here
  and get another</span> <span m='1793000'>parenthesis in there and see what it is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1800000'>Our equilibrium constant, for that reaction,</span> <span
  m='1803000'>with a separation for the standard cell potential of only</span> <span
  m='1807000'>0.12 volts, is about 106. The equilibrium constant says</span> <span
  m='1812000'>that the concentration of these ions multiplied together divided</span>
  <span m='1817000'>by the concentration of these ions multiplied together is</span>
  <span m='1822000'>based on the information contained in the half-cell</span> <span
  m='1826000'>potentials. So, that was pretty cool.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>And
  we will now go ahead and talk about another relationship</span> <span m='1834000'>that
  we can get.</span> </p><p><span m='1842000'>Over there, I was able to give you that
  relationship between</span> <span m='1846000'>the equilibrium constant and standard
  cell potential by</span> <span m='1850000'>remembering something from chemical equilibrium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1853000'>And now, we are going to do that again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1857000'>And we are going to remember that delta G for a reaction is</span> <span
  m='1862000'>equal to delta G nought plus RT ln Q.</span> </p><p><span m='1865000'>That
  is something that</span> <span m='1871000'>you should remember from your studies
  of chemical equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>And the neat thing now
  is we know we have another</span> <span m='1881000'>relationship for the free energy
  of a reaction that is related to</span> <span m='1887000'>electrical work. We got
  that up there.</span> </p><p><span m='1891000'>Now we can go, minus nFE.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1894000'>Notice that what we are going here is we are considering
  what</span> <span m='1899000'>happens when we perturb a system from equilibrium
  conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='1905000'>And when might that happen? Well, I
  showed you how to set</span> <span m='1910000'>up a Galvanic cell last time, and
  I showed you how to</span> <span m='1915000'>calculate its standard cell potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1920000'>You could measure the standard cell potential by using,</span>
  <span m='1923000'>externally, a volt meter. And, as long as you did not let</span>
  <span m='1927000'>the reaction proceed to any significant extent,</span> <span m='1931000'>then
  you would know the standard potential for that</span> <span m='1934000'>cell. And
  what we are going to do now</span> <span m='1937000'>is we are going to say, let's
  let the reaction proceed.</span> </p><p><span m='1941000'>Let's let a battery become
  discharged, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='1946000'>And, as the reaction is
  proceeding, we might want,</span> <span m='1950000'>for example, to be able to make
  a plot of</span> <span m='1954000'>the potential at any particular extent of a reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1960000'>And, in order to do that, we will develop this equation,</span>
  <span m='1965000'>here, that shows how the potential at any particular</span> <span
  m='1970000'>point along the reaction going to completion is related to the</span>
  <span m='1976000'>standard potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1987000'>And all I
  have done now is substitute minus nFE</span> <span m='1992000'>and minus nFE zero
  in, respectively,</span> <span m='1997000'>for delta G and delta G zero for the</span>
  <span m='2003000'>reaction. And now I want to go through</span> <span m='2007000'>and
  divide by minus nF. And when I do that,</span> <span m='2011000'>I am going to get
  E is equal to E zero minus (RT over nF) ln Q.</span> </p><p><span m='2018000'>And
  this equation is very</span> <span m='2025000'>central to electrochemistry. It is
  the Nernst equation.</span> </p><p><span m='2031000'>And you will be able to use
  the Nernst equation to predict how</span> <span m='2037000'>systems will behave
  when they are perturbed from equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='2045000'>And one
  example would be that of a battery discharge,</span> <span m='2049000'>like I was
  mentioning a moment ago.</span> </p><p><span m='2060000'>And so, let's kind of pick
  some arbitrary material,</span> <span m='2066000'>out of which to make a battery.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2077000'>And we will use the Nernst equation to get information</span>
  <span m='2082000'>about how it will discharge. And let's consider the</span> <span
  m='2088000'>following cell. It will be one in which the two</span> <span m='2093000'>half-reactions
  are as follows. Iron two plus plus two</span> <span m='2099000'>electrons going
  to Fe metal.</span> </p><p><span m='2107000'>And the other material will be cadmium
  two plus plus two</span> <span m='2112000'>electrons going to cadmium metal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2115000'>Now we need the two standard</span> <span m='2121000'>reduction
  potentials for iron two plus,</span> <span m='2126000'>--</span> <span m='2133000'>--
  which is coordinated in aqueous solution to six water</span> <span m='2137000'>molecules
  in an octahedral array, but we will get to that</span> <span m='2142000'>later.
  And I can see the equation but</span> <span m='2145000'>not the value. And there
  it is at -0.44.</span> </p><p><span m='2158000'>And now we need cadmium two plus
  going to</span> <span m='2161000'>cadmium, elemental form. And we see that it is
  up there</span> <span m='2167000'>at -0.40.</span> </p><p><span m='2182000'>Both
  cadmium metal and iron metal are negative of the</span> <span m='2187000'>standard
  hydrogen electrode. They are both reducing systems,</span> <span m='2192000'>as
  it were. However, we see that iron is</span> <span m='2195000'>more negative. And,
  since iron is more</span> <span m='2198000'>negative, if we set the cell up, if
  we have a piece of cadmium</span> <span m='2203000'>on one side and a piece of iron
  on the other side in this cell,</span> <span m='2208000'>then this piece of iron
  metal is going to be providing the</span> <span m='2213000'>electrons in this system,
  when we go in the spontaneous</span> <span m='2218000'>direction. The electron flow
  in the</span> <span m='2222000'>external circuit will be from the iron metal electrode
  to the</span> <span m='2228000'>cadmium metal electrode. And things happen in solution,</span>
  <span m='2233000'>as we've discussed, but that makes iron the anode.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2238000'>And for the reaction going that way, as we would have set it up,</span>
  <span m='2244000'>then we have a standard cell potential E zero of +0.04 volts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2250000'>And now, in order to apply the</span> <span m='2255000'>Nernst
  equation to answer a question about this battery --</span> <span m='2260000'>and
  this battery is not a high-voltage battery,</span> <span m='2263000'>it is only
  0.04 volts, not high-voltage at all,</span> <span m='2267000'>so you probably would
  not use it for a battery,</span> <span m='2271000'>unless you really only needed
  a small potential difference in</span> <span m='2276000'>the first place -- but,
  nonetheless,</span> <span m='2278000'>we want to know how we can use the Nernst
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='2284000'>We can say, what is E at 80% completion?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2303000'>That is the type of question we can answer using the Nernst</span>
  <span m='2307000'>equation. What is the potential drop to</span> <span m='2310000'>from
  an initial positive 0.04 volts when the reaction is 80%</span> <span m='2315000'>complete?
  Under standard conditions,</span> <span m='2319000'>we have one molar solution on
  both sides of the ions.</span> </p><p><span m='2324000'>So, in this solution, we
  would have 1.0 molar candium</span> <span m='2329000'>two plus, and over here,</span>
  <span m='2333000'>in this solution, we have 1.0 molar Fe two plus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2337000'>Because those are the standard</span> <span m='2342000'>conditions,
  as you will see written in the header to that</span> <span m='2346000'>long table
  in your appendix, because you have to define</span> <span m='2350000'>standard conditions
  in order to have a standard potential.</span> </p><p><span m='2354000'>And the standard
  conditions are 1.0 molar of the ions,</span> <span m='2357000'>respectively, in
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='2359000'>At 80% completion, what will happen is
  we will</span> <span m='2363000'>have gone in terms of producing iron two ions in</span>
  <span m='2367000'>solution. We are producing them in</span> <span m='2371000'>solution
  as the electrons flow through the external circuit</span> <span m='2376000'>because
  the piece of iron metal is the anode.</span> </p><p><span m='2381000'>And so, what
  we are interested in here is Q.</span> </p><p><span m='2385000'>I am writing backwards.
  Pretty soon I will be writing</span> <span m='2390000'>straight down or sideways.
  In the reaction,</span> <span m='2394000'>as written in the forward direction, we
  are producing Fe</span> <span m='2399000'>two plus ions such that we can define
  our Q at this</span> <span m='2405000'>80% completion value as 1.8 molar divided
  by 0.2 molar.</span> </p><p><span m='2410000'>And that is equal to,</span> <span
  m='2416000'>of course, just nine. Q is equal to nine.</span> </p><p><span m='2420000'>We
  have RT, that will be 298.15 Kelvin.</span> </p><p><span m='2424000'>RF is our number
  of Coulombs per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='2429000'>That is the Faraday constant.
  And, in this case,</span> <span m='2434000'>because in the half-reactions, you have
  two electrons rather</span> <span m='2440000'>than one being transferred, n is equal
  to two.</span> </p><p><span m='2444000'>If you plug in now, you have E zero is 0.04
  and you</span> <span m='2449000'>have RT over nF ln of 9, that will give you the</span>
  <span m='2454000'>potential at 80% completion, which is somewhere in between</span>
  <span m='2459000'>0.04 and zero, as this battery is discharged.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2465000'>If you want to model the way in which a battery is discharged,</span>
  <span m='2469000'>you can use the Nernst equation for that purpose.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2473000'>But, there is another type of cell that is interesting,</span> <span
  m='2477000'>that you can also describe very well using the Nernst equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2482000'>This will be what is called a concentration cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2503000'>Concentration cells are pretty neat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2505000'>In a concentration cell you set up a potential difference with</span>
  <span m='2510000'>the same electrode materials on both sides, just different</span>
  <span m='2515000'>concentrations. If I were writing this in terms</span> <span m='2520000'>of
  the type of diagram I used last time, I could show you that</span> <span m='2526000'>we
  could connect two beakers with a salt bridge like that and</span> <span m='2533000'>we
  could have electrode materials here dipping into</span> <span m='2538000'>solution
  on both sides. And, in solution on one side,</span> <span m='2544000'>we are going
  to have Sn two plus,</span> <span m='2549000'>divalent tin ions, at a concentration
  of 0.01</span> <span m='2553000'>molar. And, on the other side,</span> <span m='2559000'>we
  will have Sn two plus at a concentration</span> <span m='2566000'>of 0.10 molar.
  This one on the left is dilute</span> <span m='2571000'>by a factor of ten. That
  one is the more dilute one</span> <span m='2578000'>by a factor of ten. And we can
  ask what kind of a</span> <span m='2584000'>voltage is set up as a consequence of
  just simply</span> <span m='2589000'>having different concentrations of tin ions
  in the two beakers.</span> </p><p><span m='2595000'>And we can ask in which direction
  the electrons would</span> <span m='2601000'>flow in a system like this. Well, in
  this reaction,</span> <span m='2606000'>the system wants to go from a state where
  tin two plus ions at</span> <span m='2612000'>0.10 molar go to the beaker where
  we have</span> <span m='2618000'>Sn two plus ions at 0.01 molar.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2625000'>We have a potential setup here that is similar to the way</span> <span
  m='2629000'>osmosis takes place. The ions want to move from a</span> <span m='2632000'>region
  of high concentration to a region of low concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='2637000'>And
  the system would come to equilibrium at that time when</span> <span m='2641000'>the
  concentration is the same on both sides.</span> </p><p><span m='2645000'>And then
  there would no longer be any potential.</span> </p><p><span m='2649000'>The value
  of E nought for this cell is equal to zero,</span> <span m='2654000'>because we
  have the same half-reactions that would take</span> <span m='2659000'>place on both
  sides. So, E nought is equal to zero</span> <span m='2663000'>volts in the concentration
  cell. And which way do electrons go?</span> </p><p><span m='2670000'>Well, here
  is how you can think of it.</span> </p><p><span m='2672000'>The electrode material
  can be made out of tin on both sides.</span> </p><p><span m='2677000'>And, since
  tin ions are going to appear in solution on the</span> <span m='2682000'>dilute
  side, they are going to jump into solution from the</span> <span m='2686000'>electrode
  itself. A tin atom that is a piece of</span> <span m='2690000'>the metal on the
  surface of the electrode will jump into</span> <span m='2695000'>solution, increasing
  the concentration of tin two plus</span> <span m='2699000'>on the dilute side. And,
  every time it does that,</span> <span m='2705000'>we get two electrons racing through
  the external circuit,</span> <span m='2708000'>going over here, where those two
  electrons can</span> <span m='2712000'>be used to reduce tin two ions in solution</span>
  <span m='2715000'>that become a new tin atom on the surface of the electrode on</span>
  <span m='2719000'>the right-hand side. That is physically what happens</span> <span
  m='2723000'>to equilibrate the concentration of tin ions on both sides as a</span>
  <span m='2727000'>function of time. And so, what we can find is</span> <span m='2733000'>that
  these two values of the concentrations go into</span> <span m='2741000'>determining
  our Q in the following way.</span> </p><p><span m='2770000'>We have Q of 0.1. Because
  the tin ions are going</span> <span m='2773000'>from a place of high concentration
  to a place of low</span> <span m='2776000'>concentration, and electrons are traveling</span>
  <span m='2779000'>through the external circuit defining the cathode and the</span>
  <span m='2783000'>anode in the direction that I mentioned, the electrons are</span>
  <span m='2787000'>coming out over here. So, the dilute side is going to</span> <span
  m='2792000'>be your anode. And we have n equal to two,</span> <span m='2795000'>in
  this particular case, because it is a two electron</span> <span m='2799000'>process
  that converts tin two plus into metallic</span> <span m='2803000'>tin. You can take
  these numbers and</span> <span m='2805000'>plug them into the Nernst equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2808000'>And where you have E nought is equal to zero,</span> <span
  m='2811000'>n is equal to two, T would be 298.15.</span> </p><p><span m='2814000'>We
  know the Faraday constant and the gas constant.</span> </p><p><span m='2819000'>We
  have Q is equal to 0.1, which is our concentration</span> <span m='2823000'>ratio
  between the two sides. And, when we solve that,</span> <span m='2827000'>we are
  going to find that some small voltage is produced</span> <span m='2832000'>initially
  at this set of concentrations.</span> </p><p><span m='2836000'>I hope that in the
  last couple of lectures, today and last</span> <span m='2841000'>Friday, I have
  hammered home the relationship between</span> <span m='2845000'>electrochemistry
  and energy. And next time we will go</span> <span m='2851000'>forward in talking
  about molecular structure and see how</span> <span m='2855831'>that is going to
  play a role.</span> </p>
