  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>-- sometimes called the
  van der Waal's interactions.</span> </p><p><span m='20000'>And we saw that we could
  make a molecule between two inert gas</span> <span m='26000'>atoms, like argon two
  or xenon two,</span> <span m='30000'>by virtue of these dispersion interactions,</span>
  <span m='35000'>where the instantaneous charge in one atom or molecule produces</span>
  <span m='41000'>a dipole. That dipole then induces a</span> <span m='45000'>dipole
  in the neighboring molecule, and the result is a</span> <span m='52000'>stabilization,
  an attraction.</span> </p><p><span m='55000'>And we saw, last time, we had a generic
  form for the</span> <span m='61000'>interaction potential for the dispersion interactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='68000'>This Lennard-Jones interaction potential.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71000'>We talked about that in detail. And one of the parameters in</span> <span
  m='77000'>that Lennard-Jones potential was this quantity epsilon,</span> <span m='81000'>which
  actually was the well depth.</span> </p><p><span m='85000'>And I just wanted to
  talk a few moments, here,</span> <span m='89000'>about what determines what the
  well depth is,</span> <span m='93000'>what the strength of that interaction is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='98000'>And the bottom line is, what determines that is the</span>
  <span m='103000'>polarizability of the atoms or the molecules that are</span> <span
  m='108000'>interacting. And we give the symbol alpha to</span> <span m='113000'>the
  polarizability. And what that is,</span> <span m='117000'>is a measure of the ease
  with which a charge distribution can</span> <span m='123000'>be distorted. That
  is the polarizability of</span> <span m='129000'>the molecule. That is a term you
  will hear in</span> <span m='133000'>future courses quite a lot. And, in general,</span>
  <span m='138000'>the polarizability goes up with the number of electrons present.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145000'>As you go from -- And you can see on the side</span> <span
  m='151000'>slides, here. As you go from helium to argon</span> <span m='157000'>to
  xenon, and let me fix my pointer.</span> </p><p><span m='170000'>As we go from helium
  to argon to xenon, this polarizability</span> <span m='174000'>goes up because the
  number of electrons are going up.</span> </p><p><span m='177000'>If the number of
  electrons are going up, that means we have</span> <span m='181000'>electrons in
  outer shells, they are farther away from the</span> <span m='185000'>nucleus. They
  are more easily distorted.</span> </p><p><span m='189000'>As this polarizability
  goes up, helium, argon and xenon,</span> <span m='194000'>that well depth for the
  Lennard-Jones potential is going</span> <span m='199000'>up, 0.085, 0.996 and 1.8.
  And here, on this diagram,</span> <span m='203000'>I actually show you what the
  shape of the Lennard-Jones</span> <span m='208000'>potential is. Sometimes when
  I draw it on the</span> <span m='212000'>board, it is not so accurate. But you can
  see this</span> <span m='217000'>Lennard-Jones potentially actually has this repulsive
  wall</span> <span m='222000'>that goes up really very steeply.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224000'>And, likewise, on the next slide,</span> <span m='227000'>you see some
  interactions for at least one molecule here,</span> <span m='232000'>helium, nitrogen,
  and argon.</span> </p><p><span m='235000'>You can also have these dispersion interactions,</span>
  <span m='239000'>and you do have them, between molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='244000'>So,
  the polarizability is going up.</span> </p><p><span m='246000'>Helium, nitrogen,
  argon, the well depth is going</span> <span m='250000'>up. Again, these are the</span>
  <span m='252000'>Lennard-Jones potentials for those inert gases and for the</span>
  <span m='257000'>interactions between two nitrogen atoms,</span> <span m='260000'>dispersion
  interaction. All atoms and molecules have</span> <span m='264000'>these dispersion
  interactions. It is just that often times the</span> <span m='270000'>dispersion
  interactions can be so weak compared to some other</span> <span m='276000'>interactions,
  which we are going to look at</span> <span m='280000'>today, that we don't even
  think about them.</span> </p><p><span m='284000'>But they are actually there. But
  what I want to do now is to</span> <span m='290000'>talk about what happens as we
  lower the temperature even</span> <span m='295000'>further. In other words,</span>
  <span m='298000'>last time we were talking about the deviation from the inert gas</span>
  <span m='303000'>law as we lowered the temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='306000'>And
  what we said is that it is these dispersion interactions</span> <span m='311000'>that
  are the microscopic origin for the deviation from the inert</span> <span m='316000'>gas
  law, which is a macroscopic law, as you lower the</span> <span m='321000'>temperature.
  But we also know that if you</span> <span m='324000'>lower the temperature enough,
  that the gas condenses,</span> <span m='329000'>the gas liquefies. And it is these
  dispersion</span> <span m='334000'>interactions that are also responsible for the
  condensation</span> <span m='340000'>of these gases. But now, let's talk about,</span>
  <span m='344000'>a little bit more deeply, what exactly is going on as we</span>
  <span m='349000'>lower the temperature close to the liquification point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='354000'>Let me draw a Lennard-Jones potential again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='360000'>And now I am going to do it for two nitrogen molecules.</span> </p><p><span
  m='364000'>Here is nitrogen, here is nitrogen,</span> <span m='367000'>two separated
  nitrogens as a function of r,</span> <span m='371000'>the distance between the two
  nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='374000'>This is our zero of interaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='377000'>And, as I said from that slide, this bond association energy</span> <span
  m='383000'>measured from the bottom of the well is 0.79 kilojoules per</span> <span
  m='388000'>mole, the bottom of the well, where the molecules actually</span> <span
  m='393000'>can never be. But that is the well depth.</span> </p><p><span m='398000'>Now,
  let's think about this. At 300 degrees Kelvin,</span> <span m='403000'>what is the
  average energy of the molecules?</span> </p><p><span m='407000'>Well, the average
  energy is three-halves RT,</span> <span m='412000'>as we saw. And, if I substitute
  in this</span> <span m='416000'>temperature, I am going to get something on the
  order of 3.7</span> <span m='422000'>kilojoules per mole, if this has two significant</span>
  <span m='426000'>figures. 3.7 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='431000'>Well,
  let me do the following. Let me draw 3.7 kilojoules per</span> <span m='436000'>mole,
  here, on this Lennard-Jones potential.</span> </p><p><span m='440000'>When I do
  that, and I am going to start here at</span> <span m='445000'>the bottom of the
  well, and I draw 3.7 kilojoules per</span> <span m='449000'>mole, well, that is
  somewhere way up here, compared to the</span> <span m='455000'>interaction energy.
  At 300 degrees Kelvin,</span> <span m='460000'>the bottom line is that those two
  nitrogen molecules have</span> <span m='466000'>enough kinetic energy to totally
  ignore this interaction energy.</span> </p><p><span m='473000'>They are way up here.
  If they have 3.7 kilojoules per</span> <span m='479000'>mole of energy, they are
  not going to stick</span> <span m='484000'>together. They are not going to condense.</span>
  </p><p><span m='488000'>They are actually really going to ignore this small interaction</span>
  <span m='494000'>energy. They are just going to fly</span> <span m='497000'>apart.
  And they do.</span> </p><p><span m='499000'>You have a gas. However, let's lower
  the</span> <span m='502000'>temperature now. Say we lower the temperature to</span>
  <span m='507000'>100 degrees Kelvin. When we do that and calculate</span> <span
  m='513000'>the average energy at degrees Kelvin,</span> <span m='518000'>that is
  on the order of 1.2 or so kilojoules per mole average</span> <span m='525000'>energy.
  1.2 kilojoules per mole,</span> <span m='529000'>we are somewhere here. And now,
  the relative energies</span> <span m='535000'>between these nitrogen molecules are
  much lower.</span> </p><p><span m='542000'>And it is beginning to be comparable
  to this well depth.</span> </p><p><span m='547000'>And those nitrogen molecules
  now are deviating from the inert</span> <span m='552000'>gas law. They are kind
  of hanging around</span> <span m='556000'>each other. They don't hit the walls as</span>
  <span m='560000'>often, the walls of the vessel that they are in,</span> <span m='564000'>because
  they are having an attractive interaction with</span> <span m='569000'>their neighboring
  nitrogen molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='574000'>And so, we are deviating, here,
  from the inert gas law.</span> </p><p><span m='579000'>The pressure is not as large
  if you are doing it under constant</span> <span m='585000'>volume conditions. And
  then, say we lower the</span> <span m='589000'>temperature to 77 degrees Kelvin,
  which is actually the</span> <span m='594000'>boiling point of nitrogen to make
  liquid nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>Well, at 77 degrees Kelvin, the
  kinetic energy is 0.96</span> <span m='606000'>kilojoules per mole. And now, in
  this case,</span> <span m='611000'>we are fairly comparable to the well depth here
  at 0.96</span> <span m='617000'>kilojoules per mole. What happens is the gas</span>
  <span m='622000'>condenses. The interaction energy between</span> <span m='627000'>those
  two nitrogen molecules is on the order of the kinetic</span> <span m='633000'>energy.
  And then these molecules stick</span> <span m='639000'>together, the gas condenses,
  and you have a liquid.</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>That is the origin, here,
  of this temperature</span> <span m='648000'>dependence and the relevance to the
  microscopic interactions</span> <span m='654000'>between the molecules. You can
  understand that.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>And then vice versa, if you start
  to raise the</span> <span m='664000'>temperature, the molecules start to fly apart.</span>
  </p><p><span m='669000'>They ignore this interaction. Their energy is greater than</span>
  <span m='674000'>that attractive interaction. And so what you can see in the</span>
  <span m='680000'>macroscopic boiling points is the vestiges of this microscopic</span>
  <span m='687000'>interaction energy. I think I am going to put the</span> <span
  m='692000'>center screen down.</span> </p><p><span m='702000'>If you look at --</span>
  <span m='720000'>-- helium, neon, argon, krypton,</span> <span m='723000'>and xenon.
  What we said is that this</span> <span m='726000'>polarizability increases as we
  increase the number of</span> <span m='731000'>electrons. We see that the well depth</span>
  <span m='735000'>increases. Therefore, the boiling point</span> <span m='739000'>increases
  as we go down the inert gas column.</span> </p><p><span m='745000'>You can see how
  that macroscopic boiling point is a</span> <span m='749000'>reflection of what is
  happening on the microscopic scale between</span> <span m='755000'>two individual
  molecules. You can also see that in this</span> <span m='760000'>plot or in this
  chart. Here we have molecules,</span> <span m='764000'>hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='767000'>The polarizability alpha is also increasing as we go down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='772000'>Correspondingly, the well depth is increasing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='778000'>Correspondingly, that boiling point is also</span> <span m='782000'>getting
  larger and larger. That macroscopic quantity,</span> <span m='787000'>then, reflects
  the change in the individual interaction</span> <span m='792000'>energies between
  the molecules, the microscopic quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='798000'>But it also
  turns out that the shape of the molecules are</span> <span m='803000'>important.
  For example,</span> <span m='805000'>let's take this molecule, C five H twelve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='812000'>There are several ways I can draw a skeletal structure for
  C</span> <span m='816000'>five H twelve. One way is to make it pentane,</span> <span
  m='820000'>making a linear molecule. And another way is to make this</span> <span
  m='825000'>two, two dimethylpropane,</span> <span m='828000'>carbon in the center,
  some methyl groups around that</span> <span m='832000'>center carbon. It turns out
  that the boiling</span> <span m='836000'>point of pentane is 309 degrees Kelvin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='840000'>The boiling point of 2,2-dimethylpropane is</span> <span
  m='843000'>degrees Kelvin. These are two molecules that</span> <span m='847000'>have
  the same number of atoms, i.e., the same number of</span> <span m='852000'>electrons,
  should have the same polarizability.</span> </p><p><span m='855000'>However, one
  has a higher boiling point than the other.</span> </p><p><span m='860000'>And the
  reason for this is because of the different shapes</span> <span m='865000'>of these
  molecules. In the case of propane,</span> <span m='869000'>if we have an instantaneous
  fluctuation in our charge</span> <span m='874000'>distribution, it is going to be
  essentially</span> <span m='877000'>along a line. That instantaneous fluctuation</span>
  <span m='880000'>is essentially kind of rod-like because of the skeletal nature</span>
  <span m='885000'>of the pentane. So, one end is a little</span> <span m='888000'>positive,
  one end is a little negative, the other way around.</span> </p><p><span m='893000'>That
  is going to induce a dipole in a neighboring pentane</span> <span m='898000'>molecule.
  And then they are going to</span> <span m='902000'>align, positive-negative here,
  positive-negative there.</span> </p><p><span m='906000'>But then, in the case of
  dimethylpropane,</span> <span m='910000'>you are also going to have this charge
  fluctuation.</span> </p><p><span m='914000'>But in the case of propane, here, this
  is a more</span> <span m='918000'>spherical-looking molecule. And so, the charge
  fluctuation</span> <span m='923000'>is not going to be so rod-like. But, nevertheless,</span>
  <span m='928000'>this charge fluctuation, induced dipole here,</span> <span m='931000'>is
  going to induce another dipole in a neighboring</span> <span m='935000'>molecule,
  and you are going to have an attractive interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='940000'>But,
  in the case of the 2,2-dimethylpropane,</span> <span m='943000'>this is a much more
  spherical distribution than this.</span> </p><p><span m='947000'>In this case, these
  two dipoles are not as</span> <span m='950000'>close together as they are in the
  case of pentane,</span> <span m='954000'>meaning that the interaction energy, here,</span>
  <span m='957000'>between the dimethylpropane, is going to be less than it is</span>
  <span m='962000'>in the case of the pentane. And, again, that is reflected</span>
  <span m='968000'>in the macroscopic boiling points.</span> </p><p><span m='971000'>The
  boiling point of pentane is larger than that of</span> <span m='975000'>dimethylpropane
  because that microscopic interaction energy</span> <span m='980000'>is larger for
  propane because the induced dipoles can get</span> <span m='985000'>closer together.
  So, the shape is also important</span> <span m='989000'>in determining these boiling
  points, these energies of</span> <span m='993000'>interactions. That is going to
  take care of</span> <span m='998000'>our discussion of molecules or discussion of
  the induced dipole</span> <span m='1004000'>- induced dipole interaction energy
  where we are talking</span> <span m='1009000'>about molecules that do not have permanent
  dipole moments.</span> </p><p><span m='1015000'>But now we are going to turn to
  molecules with permanent dipole</span> <span m='1021000'>moments, such as HCl. And,
  of course,</span> <span m='1025000'>in these molecules, the dispersion interaction
  is</span> <span m='1029000'>also taking place. It is just that that is going</span>
  <span m='1034000'>to be weak compared to the interaction between two</span> <span
  m='1039000'>permanent dipoles. Here we have one HCl molecule,</span> <span m='1043000'>permanent
  dipole. It is going to then,</span> <span m='1047000'>in a collection of HCl molecules,
  attract another HCl</span> <span m='1051000'>molecule. And that HCl molecule is
  going</span> <span m='1056000'>to align in the opposite direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1059000'>The alignment of those two dipoles is going to lower the</span> <span
  m='1063000'>energy. That is the attractive</span> <span m='1065000'>interaction.
  And then you might say,</span> <span m='1068000'>you get this attractive interaction,
  but you also have</span> <span m='1072000'>now this repulsive interaction between
  the two chlorines and</span> <span m='1077000'>the two hydrogens. Doesn't this all
  cancel out?</span> </p><p><span m='1082000'>And the answer is no. And that is because
  of this.</span> </p><p><span m='1086000'>The positive end of one molecule and the
  negative end of</span> <span m='1091000'>the other, this distance and this distance
  on the opposite</span> <span m='1097000'>end are actually closer than the positive
  charges.</span> </p><p><span m='1102000'>The yellow distance, here, is smaller than
  the</span> <span m='1106000'>distance between the two hydrogens, is smaller than
  the</span> <span m='1111000'>distance between the two chlorines.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1116000'>And so, it is this attractive interaction that wins out,</span> <span
  m='1120000'>actually. When you put those two dipoles</span> <span m='1124000'>together,
  the repulsion actually is there, but it is the</span> <span m='1129000'>attractive
  interaction that wins out, and the whole system is</span> <span m='1134000'>stabilized
  because the distance between the unlike charges is</span> <span m='1139000'>smaller
  than the distance between the like charges.</span> </p><p><span m='1145000'>Now,
  it also turns out that we have a functional form for the</span> <span m='1151000'>dipole-dipole
  attractive interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1156000'>And that attractive interaction
  turns out to be a minus one over</span> <span m='1163000'>r cubed dependence. And
  this is exact.</span> </p><p><span m='1170000'>You can actually derive this. You
  can show that this is the</span> <span m='1174000'>interaction between two permanent
  dipoles is one over r</span> <span m='1179000'>cubed. The quantity on the top,</span>
  <span m='1182000'>mu, that is not a reduced mass, this time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1186000'>If we go back to when we started talking about dipole</span> <span m='1190000'>moments,
  this is the dipole moment of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1194000'>We have
  to use our symbols for multiple quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='1200000'>So,
  that is the dipole moment. We are talking about</span> <span m='1204000'>dipole-dipole
  attractive interactions.</span> </p><p><span m='1207000'>And that attractive interaction
  looks like this,</span> <span m='1211000'>minus one over r cubed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1214000'>Now, you might say, where is the repulsive part of</span> <span m='1218000'>this
  interaction? In the case of the</span> <span m='1221000'>Lennard-Jones potential,
  remember we had two parts,</span> <span m='1225000'>the attractive part and the
  repulsive part.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>The repulsive part was one over
  r to the 12.</span> </p><p><span m='1234000'>The attractive part was one over r
  to the 6.</span> </p><p><span m='1238000'>But it turns out that for dipole-dipole
  interaction,</span> <span m='1242000'>we do not have a general form for the repulsive
  part,</span> <span m='1246000'>unlike induced dipole - induced dipole.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1249000'>So, the best we can do, in general, is to tell you that</span> <span
  m='1253000'>the dipole-dipole attractive interaction is one over r cubed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1259000'>But I want to compare this one over r cubed to the attractive</span>
  <span m='1264000'>interaction due to the induced dipole - induced dipole</span>
  <span m='1269000'>interaction. You see that the dipole-dipole</span> <span m='1272000'>interaction
  is what we call longer range than the induced</span> <span m='1277000'>dipole -
  induced dipole. What I mean by that is that the</span> <span m='1282000'>value of
  r here, the distance between the two</span> <span m='1286000'>dipoles, can be larger.
  In the case of a longer range</span> <span m='1292000'>interaction, it can be larger
  and still have some non-zero</span> <span m='1296000'>quantity for the interaction
  potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1299000'>For example, if you are out here,</span>
  <span m='1301000'>if this value of r, you can just see with the</span> <span m='1304000'>shorter
  range interaction, one over r to the 6,</span> <span m='1308000'>that the attractive
  interaction is only the</span> <span m='1312000'>difference between the pink curve
  and the black curve,</span> <span m='1316000'>which is zero. Whereas, with a longer
  range</span> <span m='1319000'>interaction, we have more attractive interaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1324000'>This is more negative. That energy difference is</span>
  <span m='1328000'>larger. That is what we mean by a</span> <span m='1331000'>longer
  range interaction. And I want to just compare,</span> <span m='1335000'>in this
  diagram here, the strength of the dispersion</span> <span m='1340000'>interaction
  to that of the permanent dipole-dipole</span> <span m='1345000'>interaction by comparing
  the interaction between two argon</span> <span m='1350000'>atoms to those between
  two HCl molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1355000'>Argon only has the dispersive
  interaction between it because</span> <span m='1359000'>it does not have a dipole
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1362000'>And you can see that this well depth, here,
  is one kilojoule</span> <span m='1367000'>per mole, roughly speaking. But in the
  case of HCl,</span> <span m='1371000'>that well depth, here, is three kilojoules
  per</span> <span m='1374000'>mole because that has a permanent dipole.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1379000'>And, in both cases, HCl and argon-argon,</span> <span m='1383000'>we
  are talking about roughly the same number of electrons,</span> <span m='1388000'>not
  exactly, but roughly,</span> <span m='1390000'>meaning the polarizability is roughly
  the same.</span> </p><p><span m='1394000'>The dispersion interaction energy is roughly
  the same for</span> <span m='1399000'>HCl as it is for argon, but the difference
  is that HCl</span> <span m='1404000'>has that permanent dipole moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1407000'>Therefore, the deeper well depth, therefore,</span> <span m='1410000'>in
  HCl, the higher boiling point, 239 degrees Kelvin as</span> <span m='1415000'>opposed
  to 87 Kelvin for argon. What is on this slide is just</span> <span m='1423000'>an
  example of how that dipole-dipole interaction energy</span> <span m='1429000'>varies
  with the dipole moment. The larger the dipole,</span> <span m='1436000'>of course,
  the larger the interaction energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1442000'>Here, I show
  you several molecules that all have,</span> <span m='1445000'>again, roughly the
  same number of atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='1448000'>They have the same mass, they
  roughly have the same</span> <span m='1452000'>number of electrons, so they roughly
  have the same</span> <span m='1455000'>polarizability. The induced dipole - induced</span>
  <span m='1459000'>dipole is the same, but what is changing here,</span> <span m='1462000'>as
  I go down, is the dipole moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1465000'>For propane, dipole
  moment really small,</span> <span m='1468000'>0.1 debye. Dimethyl ethe,r 1.3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1472371'>Acetaldehyde,</span> <span m='1474387'>Acetonitrile,</span>
  <span m='1476000'>Dipole moment increases. The boiling point increases</span> <span
  m='1482000'>because that attractive interaction is increasing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1488000'>It scales roughly as the dipole moment squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1493000'>The dipole-dipole interaction is stronger.</span> </p><p><span m='1500000'>Now,
  I just want to briefly then remind you about one other</span> <span m='1504000'>attractive
  interaction that we have talked about before.</span> </p><p><span m='1509000'>And
  that is between two ions. There we are talking about the</span> <span m='1514000'>Coulomb
  interaction energy, where the dependence is minus</span> <span m='1518000'>one over
  r. That is the longest range</span> <span m='1522000'>interaction. Again, you can
  see this way out</span> <span m='1525000'>here. If I choose this value of r,</span>
  <span m='1528000'>the one over six interaction term would give me a</span> <span
  m='1533000'>very small value for the attractive interaction,</span> <span m='1537000'>--
  -- because it is one over r to</span> <span m='1541000'>the six. You take a large
  number for r</span> <span m='1543000'>and raise it to the 6 power and put in the
  denominator.</span> </p><p><span m='1547000'>You are going to have a small value
  for U of r.</span> </p><p><span m='1550000'>The one over r to the three gives you
  some</span> <span m='1554000'>interaction energy, but one over r gives you a lot</span>
  <span m='1557000'>of attractive interaction. It is the longest range.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1562000'>And you can also see here, in a moment,</span> <span m='1565000'>that
  it is going to be the strongest interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1569000'>What
  I am just doing is comparing several molecules or</span> <span m='1573000'>atoms.
  Here is argon 2 which has only</span> <span m='1577000'>the dispersive interaction.
  Here is the plot,</span> <span m='1580000'>well depth minus one kilojoule. Then,
  there is the HCl</span> <span m='1585000'>interaction energy that has the dispersion
  interaction in it,</span> <span m='1590000'>but also the dipole-dipole permanent
  interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1596000'>It is minus three kilojoules. And then
  we are talking about</span> <span m='1600000'>chlorine two. This is a covalent bond.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1604000'>This is no longer a Lennard-Jones potential energy,</span>
  <span m='1609000'>but this well depth, here, is minus 200 kilojoules</span> <span
  m='1613000'>per mole. And then, finally,</span> <span m='1615000'>this ionic interaction
  between potassium and chlorine,</span> <span m='1620000'>look at how strong that
  is, minus 450 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1626000'>So, these are
  the relative strengths here of these</span> <span m='1631000'>interaction energies.
  That is all I that want to say</span> <span m='1638000'>about these kinds of intermolecular
  interactions,</span> <span m='1643000'>where we are dealing with some kind of dipole.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1650000'>But before we move on, I want to talk about one other</span>
  <span m='1654000'>kind of intermolecular interaction potential.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1680000'>And that is something called hydrogen bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='1695000'>All
  right. A final intermolecular</span> <span m='1700000'>interaction, hydrogen bonding.
  Hydrogen bonding,</span> <span m='1706000'>here, occurs between a hydrogen atom
  that is attached to an</span> <span m='1713000'>electronegative atom and another
  molecule in the gas or in the</span> <span m='1719000'>solution. The first requirement
  is that</span> <span m='1723000'>you have hydrogen attached to a very electronegative
  atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1730000'>Hydrogen bonding occurs for hydrogens attached
  to oxygen,</span> <span m='1736000'>nitrogen, and chlorine. Those are all electronegative</span>
  <span m='1742000'>atoms. Water is a good example.</span> </p><p><span m='1745000'>In
  the case of water-- You have hydrogen bonded to this oxygen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1752000'>This oxygen is really very electronegative.</span> </p><p><span m='1756000'>What
  that oxygen does is it pulls those electrons away from</span> <span m='1762000'>the
  hydrogen. This hydrogen is kind of</span> <span m='1765000'>partially unshielded.
  It is partially deshielded.</span> </p><p><span m='1772000'>And then, there is a
  lot of electron density here on this</span> <span m='1778000'>oxygen. Well, because
  that hydrogen is</span> <span m='1782000'>partially deshielded and because it is
  really small,</span> <span m='1788000'>this hydrogen actually will kind of see the
  oxygen atoms on</span> <span m='1794000'>a neighboring water molecule. And since
  this is kind of</span> <span m='1801000'>partially negative, this hydrogen will
  interact</span> <span m='1805000'>with one of the lone pairs on this oxygen and
  will form a</span> <span m='1810000'>bond. This is a little bit partially</span>
  <span m='1814000'>positive, this is a little bit partially negative,</span> <span
  m='1818000'>and the result, here, is a bond between the</span> <span m='1822000'>hydrogen
  and the oxygen. And that bond is on the order</span> <span m='1827000'>of 20 to
  60 kilojoules per mole. This bond is not a covalent</span> <span m='1834000'>bond.
  A covalent bond is</span> <span m='1836000'>kilojoules per mole. This is 10% of
  it,</span> <span m='1839000'>but it is still a very important quantity or a very</span>
  <span m='1843000'>important phenomenon, this hydrogen bonding.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1847000'>The hydrogen bonding is certainly responsible for the</span> <span m='1851000'>peculiar
  properties of water, as you will learn more about in</span> <span m='1856000'>5.60,
  but it is also responsible for the unique shape,</span> <span m='1860000'>oftentimes,
  of biological molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1865000'>The helix in DNA owes its
  structure to hydrogen bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='1870000'>The hydrogen bonding
  is what makes trees stand upright.</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>The long cellulose
  molecules in trees are actually bonded</span> <span m='1881000'>together by hydrogen
  bonding. Nylon owes its strength to</span> <span m='1887000'>hydrogen bonding. And
  hydrogen bonding is also</span> <span m='1893000'>responsible for whether or not
  you have a bad hair day.</span> </p><p><span m='1900000'>As an example of that,
  I want you to look at the slide</span> <span m='1907000'>up there on the walls.
  What you see is a protein</span> <span m='1913000'>molecule. This is the structure
  of hair.</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>The molecules that make up the strands
  of your hair look like</span> <span m='1925000'>this. It is a polymer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1927000'>Well, it is a polypeptide. This unit right in here,</span> <span m='1932000'>carbon-oxygen
  bound to carbon-hydrogen bound to</span> <span m='1937000'>nitrogen-hydrogen is
  the peptide.</span> </p><p><span m='1940000'>It is repeated. You see the next unit
  over?</span> </p><p><span m='1944000'>CO-CH-NH. CO-CH-NH.</span> </p><p><span m='1946000'>That
  keeps repeating. That is the repeat unit.</span> </p><p><span m='1952000'>And, of
  course, this carbon-hydrogen right</span> <span m='1956000'>there, you can see it
  has a line there, indicating that it is</span> <span m='1961000'>bonded to something.
  And it is bonded to something.</span> </p><p><span m='1966000'>If that carbon-hydrogen
  is bound to another hydrogen,</span> <span m='1971000'>then you have a polypeptide
  which has been made from an</span> <span m='1976000'>amino acid that you might know
  of as glycine.</span> </p><p><span m='1982000'>If that carbon is bound to a CH three
  group,</span> <span m='1987000'>then that peptide was made from an amino acid that
  you might</span> <span m='1993000'>know of as alanine. And if it is bound to a CH
  two</span> <span m='1998000'>S H group, well, that was an amino acid</span> <span
  m='2003000'>known as cysteine. But what I want you to notice</span> <span m='2008000'>here
  is that these hydrogens on the nitrogen --</span> <span m='2015000'>That nitrogen
  is an electron negative atom.</span> </p><p><span m='2018000'>And that hydrogen,
  if your hair is wet,</span> <span m='2022000'>it is actually hydrogen bonded to
  a water molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2026000'>Here is that hydrogen bond. And
  then in the next strand</span> <span m='2031000'>over, this oxygen is hydrogen bonded
  to a water molecule when</span> <span m='2037000'>your hair is wet. And the bottom
  line is that</span> <span m='2042000'>when your hair is wet, you have the strands
  of your</span> <span m='2048000'>hair that kind of slip by each other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2052000'>There is no registry of one strand to another,</span> <span m='2056000'>because
  each strand has this coating, here,</span> <span m='2061000'>of water molecules
  due to hydrogen bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>Suppose you take your hair
  and put it in a very contorted</span> <span m='2072000'>configuration like this.
  And then you drive off the</span> <span m='2078000'>water molecules, you dry your
  hair.</span> </p><p><span m='2081000'>What happens is that these water molecules
  then leave,</span> <span m='2087000'>the hydrogen bonds are broken. This is not
  such a strong bond,</span> <span m='2093000'>20 to 60 kilojoules per mole, those
  hydrogen bonds are</span> <span m='2098000'>broken. And then this hydrogen on this</span>
  <span m='2102000'>nitrogen looks around and sees the oxygen with its lone pairs</span>
  <span m='2107000'>on this strand, and so you form a hydrogen bond</span> <span m='2111000'>between
  this strand and this strand.</span> </p><p><span m='2114000'>And so now the strands
  of your hair are in registry with each</span> <span m='2119000'>other. They are
  actually stronger.</span> </p><p><span m='2122000'>And they do tell you not to brush
  your hair when it is wet,</span> <span m='2127000'>because it isn't so strong. Well,
  it is not so strong</span> <span m='2133000'>because these water molecules are insulating
  each one of these</span> <span m='2139000'>strands. And when it is dry these two</span>
  <span m='2142000'>strands are bond to each other. They are in registry with each</span>
  <span m='2148000'>other. And so, if you do this right,</span> <span m='2151000'>and
  you then let go of the contorted configuration,</span> <span m='2156000'>which I
  am having trouble doing, those strands are in</span> <span m='2161000'>registry
  with each other now. And you have a good hair day.</span> </p><p><span m='2168000'>So,
  that is the importance of hydrogen bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='2173000'>I curled
  my hair just for this demo, a little asymmetric,</span> <span m='2179000'>here.
  [LAUGHTER] But now,</span> <span m='2182000'>if you are as fortunate, or unfortunate,</span>
  <span m='2186000'>depending on your preference, to have naturally curly hair,</span>
  <span m='2193000'>then what you have are a lot of sulfur-sulfur bonds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2200000'>You have a lot of cysteine peptide groups.</span> </p><p><span m='2209000'>What
  happens there is this. On the CH groups,</span> <span m='2218000'>you have CH two
  sulfur H.</span> </p><p><span m='2222000'>And on the next strand over you have S,
  CH two,</span> <span m='2227000'>and CH bonded to nitrogen, bonded to a CO.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2231000'>And you actually have a covalent bond between these two</span>
  <span m='2237000'>sulfurs, here. This is a strong bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2241000'>The
  strands of your polymers in your hair are in registry all of</span> <span m='2247000'>the
  time. And if you want to make your</span> <span m='2252000'>natural curly hair straight
  you have to do drastic things like</span> <span m='2256000'>use drastic chemicals
  to break this sulfur-sulfur bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2260000'>You can do it,
  but it is not easy.</span> </p><p><span m='2263000'>Likewise, if you have naturally
  straight hair and you want to</span> <span m='2268000'>curl it and make it semi-permanently
  curly,</span> <span m='2271000'>then you have to build in the sulfur-sulfur bonds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2275000'>And you have to do, again, some rather drastic</span> <span
  m='2278000'>chemistry to make that happen. Hydrogen bonding is important,</span>
  <span m='2285000'>especially if you go to do anything in biologically-</span> <span
  m='2292000'>related sciences, you will see that.</span> </p><p><span m='2296000'>Now,
  I am going to change topics here.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>I am going to
  change topics, and we are going to talk a</span> <span m='2316000'>little bit about
  thermodynamics in preparation to get up to</span> <span m='2322000'>chemical equilibrium
  so that Professor Cummins can come in</span> <span m='2328000'>next Wednesday and
  start talking about acid-base equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='2335000'>He is
  great. You will love him.</span> </p><p><span m='2340000'>We are going to review
  some thermodynamics today.</span> </p><p><span m='2344000'>I am going to go kind
  of quickly because some of this I</span> <span m='2348000'>think you know, but I
  want to make sure</span> <span m='2352000'>everybody is on the same page. First
  of all,</span> <span m='2355000'>bond energies. We talked about bond energies</span>
  <span m='2359000'>as delta E sub D. And we measured it from the</span> <span m='2363000'>bottom
  of the well. And I told you a few days ago,</span> <span m='2367000'>I lied to you.
  The measured energies are</span> <span m='2372000'>really from v equals zero, and
  they are.</span> </p><p><span m='2375000'>But what I am going to do is change my
  language.</span> </p><p><span m='2379000'>Instead of talking about energies, I am
  going to talk</span> <span m='2383000'>about enthalpies. I am going to talk about
  delta</span> <span m='2387000'>Hs rather than delta Es. The reason I am going to
  do</span> <span m='2391000'>this is because it is easier for us to measure a bond
  enthalpy</span> <span m='2396000'>than a bond energy. And that has to do with the</span>
  <span m='2400000'>fact that we usually make measurements in bulk under</span> <span
  m='2404000'>constant pressure conditions. And that is the quantity that</span> <span
  m='2409000'>comes out. The relationship between delta</span> <span m='2412000'>H
  and delta E is this. Delta H is equal to delta E</span> <span m='2415000'>plus delta
  PV.</span> </p><p><span m='2418000'>This is a relationship that you will learn</span>
  <span m='2422000'>about in a lot of detail in 5.60, in Chemical</span> <span m='2425000'>Thermodynamics.
  At this point,</span> <span m='2429000'>we are going to take it as a given.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2432000'>For gases, delta H differs on the order of 1% to 2% from
  delta</span> <span m='2438000'>E. It is not much,</span> <span m='2439000'>but if
  you are doing some precise calculation,</span> <span m='2444000'>you need to be
  aware of that. For liquids and solids,</span> <span m='2448000'>delta H and delta
  E are really the same for all intrinsic</span> <span m='2454000'>purposes. The delta
  PV term is really</span> <span m='2457000'>very small. And, in thermodynamics,</span>
  <span m='2462000'>since we are most always looking at changes in energy,</span>
  <span m='2466000'>we need what we call standard states.</span> </p><p><span m='2470000'>And
  we are going to put a nought, here,</span> <span m='2473000'>on all of our delta
  Hs to designate the standard state.</span> </p><p><span m='2478000'>And our standard
  state that your book uses,</span> <span m='2482000'>and will use, refers really
  to the pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='2486000'>And the pressure is one bar. And
  one bar is equal to 10^5</span> <span m='2493000'>Pascal. That is equal to 10^5
  kilograms</span> <span m='2497000'>per meter second squared. The delta Hs we are
  going to</span> <span m='2503000'>talk about are also, just about all of them,</span>
  <span m='2507000'>measured at 298.15 degrees Kelvin.</span> </p><p><span m='2511000'>Delta
  H does depend on temperature, but we actually are</span> <span m='2517000'>not going
  to look at that in the next few days.</span> </p><p><span m='2524000'>You are going
  to do that in</span> <span m='2527000'>Our delta Hs are going to be delta Hs at
  298.15 degrees</span> <span m='2532000'>Kelvin. On the first slide here,</span>
  <span m='2535000'>I show you a bunch of bond enthalpies for CH bonds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2540000'>And, of course, those bond enthalpies are a</span> <span m='2545000'>little
  bit different, depending on what molecule you</span> <span m='2550000'>have. But
  they are not that</span> <span m='2553000'>different. And so, what is often done,</span>
  <span m='2556000'>and your book does this, is that somebody goes and</span> <span
  m='2560000'>calculates the average of the bond energies for lots of CH</span> <span
  m='2565000'>bonds and lots of molecules and they prepare a table that looks</span>
  <span m='2570000'>like this. This is the mean bond enthalpy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2573000'>And they have CH, CC, carbon-carbon.</span> </p><p><span m='2576000'>But
  these are average bond enthalpies.</span> </p><p><span m='2581000'>Now, why are
  bond enthalpies important to us?</span> </p><p><span m='2584000'>Well, they are
  important because they determine the</span> <span m='2588000'>enthalpy of a chemical
  reaction. If the bonds are stronger in</span> <span m='2593000'>the products than
  in the reactants, that is going to give</span> <span m='2598000'>us an exothermic
  reaction. If the bonds are stronger in</span> <span m='2602000'>the reactants than
  the products, that gives us an endothermic</span> <span m='2607000'>reaction. And
  so let's look at this</span> <span m='2611000'>reaction. This is an important reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2614000'>This is the oxidation of glucose.</span> </p><p><span m='2616000'>This
  is a reaction very exothermic, minus</span> <span m='2620000'>kilojoules per mole.
  It is a reaction that is being</span> <span m='2624000'>carried out in every cell
  of your body as we speak.</span> </p><p><span m='2628000'>It is the reaction that
  is providing the energy to maintain</span> <span m='2633000'>your body temperature,
  the energy to move your</span> <span m='2636000'>muscles, the energy to repair tissue,
  and the energy to think.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>Important reaction. This
  is the reason why we eat.</span> </p><p><span m='2646000'>This is the reason why
  we breathe, this is the reason why</span> <span m='2650000'>we exhale, and this
  is the reason why we pee.</span> </p><p><span m='2653000'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span
  m='2663000'>What do we need to do to calculate the enthalpy for this</span> <span
  m='2667000'>reaction? We have to figure out how much</span> <span m='2670000'>energy
  is required to break all of the bonds of the reactants</span> <span m='2675000'>because
  that is how much energy we put in.</span> </p><p><span m='2678000'>And then we have
  to figure out then how much energy we get back</span> <span m='2683000'>when we
  form the product bonds. Bottom line is,</span> <span m='2687000'>the enthalpy necessary
  to break all of the bonds,</span> <span m='2691000'>you can calculate, is 12,452
  kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='2694000'>That number comes from using
  these average bond energies I</span> <span m='2699000'>told you about. We can then
  get back some</span> <span m='2704000'>energy, minus 15,000, approximately,</span>
  <span m='2707000'>when we form some new bonds. That number comes from those</span>
  <span m='2712000'>average bond enthalpies. The difference between these</span> <span
  m='2717000'>two energy levels is the exothermicity of the reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2722000'>Now, what did we do to get the enthalpy?</span> </p><p><span m='2725000'>Well,
  what I did is took the bond enthalpies of each bond of</span> <span m='2731000'>the
  reactants and summed them. Then, I took the bond</span> <span m='2736000'>enthalpies
  for each one of the products, summed them,</span> <span m='2740000'>and subtracted
  the two to get the enthalpy of the reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2744000'>I want
  you to notice something here, important.</span> </p><p><span m='2747000'>This is
  reactants minus products.</span> </p><p><span m='2749000'>In a moment, I am going
  to show you another</span> <span m='2752000'>way to calculate the enthalpy for a
  reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2755000'>And it is going to be products minus reactants.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2760000'>You have to know this. But you also see that the</span>
  <span m='2763000'>calculated enthalpy is not the experimental enthalpy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2767000'>Why? Because we use the average bond</span> <span m='2770000'>enthalpies.
  We did not use the exact bond</span> <span m='2773000'>enthalpies because if we
  had to use the exact bond enthalpies,</span> <span m='2778000'>can you imagine the
  size of the table of data that we would have</span> <span m='2783000'>to have? We
  would have to have a bond</span> <span m='2786000'>enthalpy for every bond for every
  known molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2791000'>That is a lot. What are we going
  to do,</span> <span m='2794000'>then? Is there a more accurate way to</span> <span
  m='2797000'>do that? Yes, with knowing the absolute</span> <span m='2801000'>bond
  enthalpies. But that is too much data.</span> </p><p><span m='2805000'>Is there
  some other way to do it?</span> </p><p><span m='2807000'>Yes. We are going to use
  heats of</span> <span m='2810000'>formation. A heat of formation,</span> <span m='2813000'>delta
  H nought with an F as a subscript.</span> </p><p><span m='2817000'>The heat of formation
  is the</span> <span m='2822000'>enthalpy of a reaction that forms one mole of a
  compound</span> <span m='2828000'>from the pure elements in their most stable form
  in their</span> <span m='2834000'>standard state. For example,</span> <span m='2837000'>here
  is water. We are forming one mole of</span> <span m='2841000'>water from its elements,
  hydrogen and oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='2845000'>The enthalpy for this reaction
  is defined as the heat of</span> <span m='2851000'>formation of water. Why is this
  the heat of</span> <span m='2856000'>formation of water? Well, because we are forming</span>
  <span m='2859000'>one mole, and that is important, from the elements that make up</span>
  <span m='2864000'>water. What elements are they?</span> </p><p><span m='2866000'>They
  are hydrogen. But notice that this hydrogen</span> <span m='2869000'>is H two. It
  is not hydrogen atoms</span> <span m='2872000'>because H two is the most stable
  form of hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='2876000'>Oxygen is O two, not oxygen atoms
  because this</span> <span m='2880000'>is the most stable form of oxygen at bar pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2885000'>Look at this here. What is the heat of formation</span>
  <span m='2888000'>of oxygen? Well, the enthalpy change for</span> <span m='2892000'>this
  reaction is zero. That is the heat of formation</span> <span m='2896000'>of oxygen.
  Why?</span> </p><p><span m='2897000'>Because we are forming one mole of oxygen from
  the elements in</span> <span m='2902000'>their most stable form. For elements like
  oxygen,</span> <span m='2907000'>hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, two</span> <span
  m='2910000'>in the gas phase, those all have heats of</span> <span m='2914000'>formation
  that are equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2919000'>And then, finally, here
  is the expression or the</span> <span m='2922000'>reaction that gives us one mole
  of glucose.</span> </p><p><span m='2925000'>The enthalpy for this reaction is the
  heat of formation of</span> <span m='2929000'>glucose. We get it from its elements,</span>
  <span m='2931000'>hydrogen, oxygen, and look at the elemental form,</span> <span
  m='2935000'>the most stable form of the element carbon is graphite.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2940000'>Is there an 18.0-something exam?</span> </p><p><span m='2942000'>Yes?
  Okay.</span> </p><p><span m='2943000'>See you on Monday.</span> </p>
