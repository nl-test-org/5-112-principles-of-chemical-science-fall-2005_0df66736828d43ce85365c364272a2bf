  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>Let's get going, here.</span>\
  \ <span m='16000'>Remember where we were? We were trying to figure out</span> <span\
  \ m='20000'>the structure of the atom. At the beginning of the course,</span> <span\
  \ m='25000'>we saw classical physics, classical mechanics fail to</span> <span m='29000'>describe\
  \ how that electron in the nucleus hung together.</span> <span m='35000'>Then we\
  \ started talking about this wave-particle duality of</span> <span m='39000'>light\
  \ and matter. We saw that radiation and</span> <span m='43000'>matter both can exhibit\
  \ both wave-like properties and</span> <span m='47000'>particle-like properties.\
  \ And it was really important,</span> <span m='51000'>this observation of Davisson\
  \ and Germer, and George Thompson,</span> <span m='56000'>this observation that\
  \ electrons exhibited inference phenomena.</span> <span m='62000'>That is when you\
  \ took electrons and scattered them from a nickel</span> <span m='67000'>single\
  \ crystal. The electrons scattered back as</span> <span m='71000'>if they were behaving\
  \ as waves. There were diffraction</span> <span m='76000'>phenomena or interference\
  \ phenomena, bright,</span> <span m='80000'>dark, bright, dark patterns of electrons.</span>\
  \ <span m='83000'>Actually, that Davisson and Germer paper is on our website.</span>\
  \ <span m='90000'>You are welcome to take a look at that.</span> <span m='93000'>It\
  \ was just that observation, coupled with de Broglie's</span> <span m='99000'>insight\
  \ into Schr\xF6dinger's relativistic equations of motion</span> <span m='105000'>that\
  \ led Schr\xF6dinger to say, well, maybe what I need to do</span> <span m='111000'>is\
  \ I need to treat the wave-like properties of that electron in a</span> <span m='118000'>hydrogen\
  \ atom. Maybe that is the key.</span> <span m='123000'>In particular, maybe that\
  \ is the key because</span> <span m='127000'>the electron has a de Broglie wavelength\
  \ that is on the order</span> <span m='134000'>of the size of its environment. Maybe,\
  \ in those cases,</span> <span m='140000'>I need to treat the particle as a wave\
  \ and not as a particle</span> <span m='146000'>with classical mechanics. He wrote\
  \ down this wave</span> <span m='151000'>equation, an equation of motion for waves,\
  \ this H Psi equals E</span> <span m='157000'>Psi, where we said last time we are\
  \ going to represent the</span> <span m='162000'>electron, our particle, by this\
  \ Psi,</span> <span m='165000'>the wave. We are going to call it a wavef</span>\
  \ <span m='168000'>unction because we are going to put a functional form to it very</span>\
  \ <span m='173000'>soon. And there was some kind of</span> <span m='176000'>operator,\
  \ here, called the Hamiltonian</span> <span m='179000'>operator, that operated on\
  \ this wave function.</span> <span m='185000'>And, when it did, you got back the\
  \ same wave</span> <span m='188000'>function times a constant E. And this constant,</span>\
  \ <span m='192000'>as we are going to see, is going to be the binding</span> <span\
  \ m='196000'>energy of the electron to the nucleus.</span> <span m='199000'>But\
  \ then, we took a little detour and I said,</span> <span m='203000'>well, let's\
  \ see if we can derive, in a sense,</span> <span m='206000'>the Schr\xF6dinger equation.\
  \ And that is what we started to</span> <span m='212000'>do. And I am really doing\
  \ this for</span> <span m='215000'>fun, you are not responsible for it, but I am\
  \ doing it because I</span> <span m='221000'>want you to see just how easy this\
  \ is.</span> <span m='225000'>To illustrate this, I am just going to take a</span>\
  \ <span m='229000'>one-dimensional problem. I am going to let my electron</span>\
  \ <span m='234000'>be represented by this wave, one-dimension,</span> <span m='237000'>Psi\
  \ of x. 2 a cosine 2 pi x over lambda.</span> <span m='242000'>And then I said,</span>\
  \ <span m='245000'>suppose I want an equation of motion, I want to know how that</span>\
  \ <span m='250000'>Psi changes with x. Well, you already know that if</span> <span\
  \ m='253000'>I take the derivative of Psi with x, that is going to tell me</span>\
  \ <span m='257000'>how Psi changes with x. And we did that last time.</span> <span\
  \ m='261000'>And then I said, well, I want to know the rate</span> <span m='264000'>of\
  \ change of Psi with x. I am going to take the</span> <span m='267000'>derivative\
  \ again. I have the second derivative of</span> <span m='272000'>Psi of x. And that\
  \ is what we got last</span> <span m='274000'>time. And then, I noticed that in\
  \ the</span> <span m='277000'>second derivative, and you noticed,</span> <span m='279000'>too,\
  \ somebody said this was recursive, that we have our</span> <span m='283000'>original\
  \ wave function back in this expression.</span> <span m='287000'>I can rewrite that\
  \ whole second derivative here just as minus 2</span> <span m='291000'>pi squared,\
  \ quantity squared, over lambda,</span> <span m='294000'>psi of x.</span> <span\
  \ m='297000'>So far, this is just any old wave</span> <span m='300000'>equation.\
  \ Nothing special about this.</span> <span m='305000'>This anybody could, and had,\
  \ written down before.</span> <span m='310000'>What is special is that Schr\xF6\
  dinger realized,</span> <span m='314000'>here, that if this is going to be a wave\
  \ equation for a</span> <span m='319000'>particle, then maybe this lambda here,\
  \ maybe I ought to put in</span> <span m='325000'>for lambda what de Broglie told\
  \ me.</span> <span m='330000'>And that is h over p. Maybe this lambda here is the</span>\
  \ <span m='334000'>wavelength of a matter wave, so let me write this expression</span>\
  \ <span m='340000'>in terms of the momentum of the particle, where the momentum\
  \ has</span> <span m='346000'>this mass m in it. And so when he did this,</span>\
  \ <span m='350000'>this became minus p squared over h bar squared,</span> <span\
  \ m='354000'>we said hbar is h over 2pi, times psi of x.</span> <span m='358000'>Hey,\
  \ this is getting good</span> <span m='364000'>because now we have a Psi of x over\
  \ here.</span> <span m='368000'>But then what he said was, well, I want to write\
  \ this</span> <span m='374000'>momentum in terms of the total energy.</span> <span\
  \ m='377000'>Total energy is always kinetic plus potential.</span> <span m='382000'>The\
  \ kinetic energy, we said the other day,</span> <span m='386000'>can be written\
  \ in terms of the momentum.</span> <span m='392000'>The kinetic energy is p squared\
  \ over 2m-- plus the potential</span> <span m='396000'>energy. And I</span> <span\
  \ m='399000'>am going to make this as a function of x,</span> <span m='403000'>the\
  \ potential energy. Now, I am just going to solve</span> <span m='407000'>this for\
  \ p squared. p squared is equal to 2m times</span> <span m='411000'>the total energy\
  \ minus this potential energy.</span> <span m='414000'>Now, I am going to plug this\
  \ into</span> <span m='419000'>here right in there. And, when I do that,</span>\
  \ <span m='423000'>I am going to get the second derivative of Psi of x with</span>\
  \ <span m='428000'>respect to x equals minus 2m over h bar squared times E minus</span>\
  \ <span m='433000'>U of x times Psi of x.</span> <span m='438000'>Just simple substitution\
  \ for p</span> <span m='443000'>squared there. Nothing else.</span> <span m='445000'>Now,\
  \ I am going to do some rearranging.</span> <span m='450000'>And the rearranging,\
  \ on the right-hand side,</span> <span m='453000'>is I am going to have only E times\
  \ Psi of x.</span> <span m='457000'>E times Psi of x looks like the right-hand side\
  \ of the</span> <span m='462000'>Schr\xF6dinger as I wrote it down. That is good.</span>\
  \ <span m='466000'>When I rearrange this, I get minus hbar squared over</span> <span\
  \ m='470000'>2m times the second derivative of Psi of x with respect to x</span>\
  \ <span m='475000'>plus U of x times Psi of x equals E times Psi of x.</span> <span\
  \ m='487000'>And now, I am going to pull out a Psi of x here,</span> <span m='491000'>so\
  \ that is minus hbar squared over 2m second derivative with</span> <span m='497000'>respect\
  \ to x plus U of x, the quantity times Psi of x</span> <span m='501000'>equals E\
  \ times Psi of x.</span> <span m='507000'>And guess what?</span> <span m='510000'>We've\
  \ got it. We got it because all of this</span> <span m='516000'>is what we define\
  \ as the Hamiltonian.</span> <span m='521000'>All of this is h hat. H hat, operating\
  \ on Psi of x,</span> <span m='527000'>gives us E times Psi of x. This Hamiltonian,</span>\
  \ <span m='534000'>as you will learn later on, is a kinetic energy</span> <span\
  \ m='541000'>operator. This is the potential energy</span> <span m='546000'>operator\
  \ operating on psi. That is the Schr\xF6dinger</span> <span m='551000'>equation.\
  \ It is hardly a derivation.</span> <span m='555000'>It is taking derivatives. It\
  \ is a wave equation.</span> <span m='559000'>The insight came right here, this\
  \ substitution of the de</span> <span m='565000'>Broglie wavelength in an ordinary\
  \ wave equation.</span> <span m='571000'>This is the insight, getting that momentum\
  \ in there</span> <span m='577000'>with the mass, making this,</span> <span m='580000'>then,\
  \ an equation for a matter wave.</span> <span m='584000'>That is it. You just \"\
  derived the</span> <span m='588000'>Schr\xF6dinger equation.\" Easy.</span> <span\
  \ m='603000'>Bottom line here is that the Schr\xF6dinger equation is to</span> <span\
  \ m='607000'>quantum mechanics like Newton's equations are to classical</span> <span\
  \ m='611000'>mechanics. When the wavelength of a</span> <span m='613000'>particle\
  \ is on the order of the size of its environment,</span> <span m='617000'>the equation\
  \ of motion that you have to use to describe that</span> <span m='622000'>particle\
  \ moving within some potential field U of x</span> <span m='626000'>or U, you have\
  \ to us this equation of motion and not</span> <span m='630000'>Newton's equations.\
  \ Newton's equations don't work</span> <span m='635000'>to describe the motion of\
  \ any particle whose wavelength is on</span> <span m='641000'>the order of the size\
  \ of the environment.</span> <span m='645000'>It just does not work. Now, just as\
  \ an aside,</span> <span m='649000'>classical mechanics really is embedded in quantum\
  \ mechanics.</span> <span m='656000'>That is, if you took a problem and solved it\
  \ quantum</span> <span m='660000'>mechanically, and you solved the problem,</span>\
  \ <span m='664000'>a problem for which the wavelength of a particle was</span> <span\
  \ m='668000'>much, much greater than the size of the environment,</span> <span m='673000'>which\
  \ is the classical limit, quantum mechanics would give</span> <span m='678000'>you\
  \ the right answer. In other words,</span> <span m='681000'>say you took some problem\
  \ where the wavelength of the particle</span> <span m='686000'>is larger than the\
  \ size of the environment.</span> <span m='692000'>That is, a problem where you\
  \ would normally use classical</span> <span m='695000'>mechanics. But if you use\
  \ quantum</span> <span m='697000'>mechanics, you would get the right answer,</span>\
  \ <span m='700000'>if you could solve the problem because the equations are very</span>\
  \ <span m='704000'>difficult. But, in principle,</span> <span m='705000'>you would\
  \ get the right answer. However, if you took a quantum</span> <span m='709000'>mechanical\
  \ problem, that is, a problem where the</span> <span m='712000'>wavelength of the\
  \ particle is on the order of the size of the</span> <span m='716000'>environment\
  \ and you used classical mechanics,</span> <span m='719000'>well, you won't get\
  \ the right answer.</span> <span m='723000'>Because classical mechanics is, in a\
  \ sense, a subset.</span> <span m='728000'>It is contained within quantum mechanics.</span>\
  \ <span m='732000'>It is a limit of quantum mechanics.</span> <span m='735000'>We\
  \ have to learn a new kind of mechanics, here,</span> <span m='740000'>this mechanics\
  \ for the motion of waves.</span> <span m='744000'>Now, for a hydrogen atom, we\
  \ have to think of the wave</span> <span m='749000'>function in three dimensions\
  \ instead of just one dimension,</span> <span m='755000'>here. And so we are going\
  \ to have to</span> <span m='759000'>describe the particle in terms of three position\
  \ coordinates.</span> <span m='764000'>Usually you use Cartesian coordinates, x,</span>\
  \ <span m='767000'>y, and z. But this problem is solvable</span> <span m='770000'>exactly\
  \ if we use spherical coordinates.</span> <span m='774000'>How many of you had spherical\
  \ coordinates before and know what</span> <span m='779000'>we are talking about?\
  \ Not everybody.</span> <span m='783000'>If I gave you an x, y and z for this electron\
  \ in</span> <span m='786000'>this atom, where the nucleus was pinned at the origin.</span>\
  \ <span m='791000'>If I gave you an x, y and z coordinate,</span> <span m='794000'>you\
  \ would know where that electron was.</span> <span m='797000'>But, alternatively,\
  \ I could tell you the position</span> <span m='801000'>of this electron using spherical\
  \ coordinates.</span> <span m='804000'>That is, I could tell you what the distance\
  \ is of the electron</span> <span m='809000'>from the nucleus. I am going to call\
  \ that r.</span> <span m='814000'>That will be one of the variables.</span> <span\
  \ m='816000'>I could then also tell you this angle theta.</span> <span m='820000'>Theta\
  \ is the angle that r makes from the z-axis.</span> <span m='823000'>That is the\
  \ second coordinate. And then, finally,</span> <span m='827000'>the third coordinate\
  \ is phi. Phi is the angle made by the</span> <span m='832000'>following. If I take\
  \ the electron and drop</span> <span m='835000'>it perpendicular to the x,y-plane\
  \ and then I draw a line</span> <span m='840000'>here, well, the angle between that\
  \ line and the x-axis is the</span> <span m='844000'>angle phi. Instead of giving\
  \ you x,</span> <span m='849000'>y, and z, I am just going to give you r, theta,</span>\
  \ <span m='852000'>and phi in spherical coordinates.</span> <span m='855000'>And\
  \ now, this wave function is also a function of time,</span> <span m='860000'>and\
  \ I will talk about that a little bit probably next time.</span> <span m='865000'>So,\
  \ that is the wave function that is in some way going to</span> <span m='870000'>represent\
  \ our electron. I haven't told you exactly yet</span> <span m='875000'>how Psi represents\
  \ the electron, and I won't tell you that for</span> <span m='879000'>another few\
  \ days. Question?</span> <span m='895000'>No. I actually thought this was the</span>\
  \ <span m='899000'>way the book set it up. I may have it backwards.</span> <span\
  \ m='909000'>I think this is the way our book sets it up.</span> <span m='912000'>It\
  \ won't make a difference in any of the problems we solve</span> <span m='916000'>here.\
  \ But, in general,</span> <span m='918000'>if you are given a problem to solve,\
  \ you are going to have to</span> <span m='923000'>look and see how they define\
  \ their coordinate system.</span> <span m='928000'>Actually, somebody else asked\
  \ me that the other day.</span> <span m='933000'>Now, what we have to do is actually\
  \ set up the Hamiltonian</span> <span m='939000'>for the hydrogen atom. That is,\
  \ we have to set up the</span> <span m='945000'>Hamiltonian specifically for the\
  \ hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='950000'>And we have to set it up in terms of spherical\
  \ coordinates,</span> <span m='956000'>r, theta, and phi. And when we do that,</span>\
  \ <span m='961000'>and we are not actually going to do that, that is what the</span>\
  \ <span m='966000'>Hamiltonian looks like. Actually, this is in three</span> <span\
  \ m='970000'>dimensions, and so if I were doing it in the x,</span> <span m='974000'>y,\
  \ z, what I would have here is a second derivative with respect</span> <span m='980000'>to\
  \ y, plus a second derivative with respect to z.</span> <span m='984000'>That is\
  \ what it would look like in three dimensions in Cartesian</span> <span m='989000'>coordinates.\
  \ But when I transform from</span> <span m='993000'>Cartesian coordinates to spherical\
  \ coordinates,</span> <span m='997000'>an exercise that takes five pages, and everybody\
  \ should have</span> <span m='1001000'>that experience once in their life, but maybe\
  \ now is not the</span> <span m='1005000'>right time for that experience, you do\
  \ get this.</span> <span m='1008000'>And essentially, the Hamiltonian is a sum of</span>\
  \ <span m='1011000'>second derivatives with respect to each one of the coordinates,</span>\
  \ <span m='1016000'>because essentially this term is a second derivative with</span>\
  \ <span m='1020000'>respect to r. This term is a second</span> <span m='1023000'>derivative\
  \ with respect to theta.</span> <span m='1026000'>This term is a second derivative\
  \ with respect to phi.</span> <span m='1030000'>That is the specific Hamiltonian.</span>\
  \ <span m='1032000'>These are all kinetic energy operators, as you will learn</span>\
  \ <span m='1037000'>later on. And then there is this term</span> <span m='1040000'>here,\
  \ U of r. This U of r,</span> <span m='1042000'>what is that? What is U(r)?</span>\
  \ <span m='1044000'>Potential energy. It is the Coulomb potential</span> <span m='1047000'>energy\
  \ of interaction. It is isotropic,</span> <span m='1052000'>meaning it is the same\
  \ at all angles.</span> <span m='1055000'>The only thing it depends on is the distance\
  \ of the electron</span> <span m='1060000'>from the nucleus. It only depends on\
  \ r.</span> <span m='1063000'>It doesn't depend on theta and phi.</span> <span m='1066000'>So,\
  \ that is the Schr\xF6dinger equation for the hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='1070000'>It\
  \ is a differential equation, second-order ordinary</span> <span m='1075000'>differential\
  \ equation. In 18.03, you are going to</span> <span m='1080000'>learn how to solve\
  \ that. In 5.61, or 8.04 I think it is,</span> <span m='1084000'>in physics, in\
  \ quantum mechanics, you are going to</span> <span m='1088000'>solve that. You can\
  \ do that.</span> <span m='1090000'>It is not hard. But what do I mean when I say</span>\
  \ <span m='1094000'>solve? What I mean is that we are</span> <span m='1096000'>going\
  \ to calculate these Es, these binding energies,</span> <span m='1101000'>this constant\
  \ in front of the psi.</span> <span m='1103000'>That is called an eigenvalue, for\
  \ those of you who might know</span> <span m='1108000'>something already about these\
  \ kinds of differential equations.</span> <span m='1115000'>This E is the binding\
  \ energy of the electron to the nucleus.</span> <span m='1120000'>We are going to\
  \ look at those results in just a moment.</span> <span m='1125000'>And the other\
  \ quantity we are going to solve for,</span> <span m='1130000'>here, is psi. What\
  \ we are going to want to</span> <span m='1133000'>find is the actual functional\
  \ form for the wave functions.</span> <span m='1140000'>That, we can get out of\
  \ solving this differential equation.</span> <span m='1144000'>The actual functional\
  \ form for psi.</span> <span m='1147000'>The functional form is going to be more\
  \ complicated than what I</span> <span m='1153000'>wrote here, but we can get that.\
  \ We will look at that in a few</span> <span m='1158000'>days from now. And do you\
  \ know what those wave</span> <span m='1162000'>functions are? They are what you\
  \ studied in</span> <span m='1165000'>high school as orbitals. You talked about\
  \ an s-orbital,</span> <span m='1171000'>p-orbital, d-orbital. Orbitals are wave\
  \ functions.</span> <span m='1174000'>That where they come from, orbitals, from\
  \ solving the</span> <span m='1178000'>Schr\xF6dinger equation. Now, specifically,</span>\
  \ <span m='1181000'>orbitals are the spatial part of a wave function.</span> <span\
  \ m='1185000'>There is also a spin part to the wave function,</span> <span m='1188000'>but\
  \ for all intents and purposes, we are going to use</span> <span m='1192000'>the\
  \ term orbital and wave function interchangeably because</span> <span m='1196000'>they\
  \ are the same thing. Question?</span> <span m='1200000'>We are going to get to\
  \ that in just a moment,</span> <span m='1203000'>and if you think I don't answer\
  \ it then we will go back to it.</span> <span m='1209000'>We are going to solve\
  \ this. And this equation is going to</span> <span m='1213000'>predict binding energies,\
  \ and it is going to predict</span> <span m='1218000'>these wave functions in agreement\
  \ with our observations,</span> <span m='1222000'>and it is going to predict that\
  \ the hydrogen atom is stable.</span> <span m='1229000'>Remember when we tried to\
  \ predict the hydrogen atom using</span> <span m='1233000'>classical ideas? We found\
  \ it lived a whole</span> <span m='1236000'>whopping 10^-10 seconds. Not so when\
  \ we treat the</span> <span m='1240000'>hydrogen atom with the quantum mechanical\
  \ equations of motion.</span> <span m='1245000'>Let's write down the results for\
  \ solving the Schr\xF6dinger</span> <span m='1250000'>equation. And the part I am\
  \ going to</span> <span m='1253000'>concentrate on today is these binding energies.</span>\
  \ <span m='1258000'>And, on Friday, we will talk about the wave</span> <span m='1260000'>function,\
  \ solving the Schr\xF6dinger equation for those</span> <span m='1263000'>wave functions.</span>\
  \ <span m='1276000'>What does the binding energy look like?</span> <span m='1279000'>Well,\
  \ the binding energies, here, coming out of the</span> <span m='1283000'>Schr\xF6\
  dinger equation look like this, minus 1 over n squared</span> <span m='1288000'>times\
  \ m e to the 4 over 8 epsilon nought squared time h</span> <span m='1292000'>squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='1295000'>m is the mass of the electron.</span> <span m='1300000'>e is\
  \ the charge on the electron.</span> <span m='1303000'>Epsilon nought is this permittivity\
  \ of vacuum we talked</span> <span m='1308000'>about before. This is a conversion\
  \ between</span> <span m='1312000'>ESU units and SI units. h is Planck's constant.</span>\
  \ <span m='1316000'>Planck's constant is ubiquitous.</span> <span m='1319000'>It\
  \ is everywhere. What we typically do is we lump</span> <span m='1325000'>these\
  \ constants together. And we call those constants a</span> <span m='1331000'>new\
  \ constant, the Rydberg constant,</span> <span m='1335000'>R sub H. And so our expression\
  \ is equal</span> <span m='1341000'>to minus R sub H over n squared.</span> <span\
  \ m='1348000'>The value of R sub H is equal to 2.17987x10^-18 joules.</span> <span\
  \ m='1355000'>That is a number that you are going to use a lot in the next</span>\
  \ <span m='1363000'>few days. But what you also see,</span> <span m='1368000'>here,\
  \ is an n. What is n?</span> <span m='1371000'>Well, n is what we call the principle\
  \ quantum number.</span> <span m='1380000'>And its allowed values are integers,\
  \ where the integers</span> <span m='1387000'>start with 1, 2, 3, all the way up\
  \ to n is</span> <span m='1393000'>equal to infinity. Well, let's try to understand</span>\
  \ <span m='1399000'>this a little bit more by looking at an energy level</span>\
  \ <span m='1406000'>diagram again. I am just plotting here energy.</span> <span\
  \ m='1412000'>Here is the zero of energy. Here is the expression for the</span>\
  \ <span m='1418000'>energy levels that come out of the Schr\xF6dinger equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='1423000'>When n is equal to one, that is the lowest allowed</span> <span\
  \ m='1428000'>value for n, binding energy is essentially equal to minus the</span>\
  \ <span m='1434000'>Rydberg constant. **E = -(R)H**</span> <span m='1438000'>But\
  \ our equation says the binding energy of the electron</span> <span m='1442000'>can\
  \ also be this value because when n is equal to 2,</span> <span m='1447000'>well,\
  \ the binding energy now is only a quarter of the Rydberg</span> <span m='1451000'>constant.\
  \ It is higher</span> <span m='1455000'>in energy. When n is equal to 3,</span>\
  \ <span m='1457000'>well, the binding energy of that electron to the nucleus is</span>\
  \ <span m='1462000'>a ninth to the Rydberg constant. When it is equal to 4,</span>\
  \ <span m='1466000'>it is a sixteenth. When it is equal to 5,</span> <span m='1470000'>it\
  \ is a twenty-fifth. When it is equal to six,</span> <span m='1474000'>it is a thirty-sixth.\
  \ So on, so on,</span> <span m='1477000'>and so on until it gets n equal to infinity.</span>\
  \ <span m='1480000'>When n is equal to infinity, then the binding energy is</span>\
  \ <span m='1485000'>zero. When n is equal to infinity,</span> <span m='1487000'>the\
  \ electron and the nucleus are no longer bound.</span> <span m='1491000'>They are\
  \ separated from each other.</span> <span m='1494000'>They don't hang together when\
  \ n is equal to infinity.</span> <span m='1500000'>Now, this is rather peculiar.\
  \ This is saying that the binding</span> <span m='1505000'>energy of the electron\
  \ to the nucleus can have essentially an</span> <span m='1510000'>infinite number\
  \ of values, except it is a discrete number</span> <span m='1516000'>of infinite\
  \ numbers of values. In the sense that the binding</span> <span m='1521000'>energy\
  \ can be this or this or this, but it cannot be something</span> <span m='1527000'>in\
  \ between, here or here or here.</span> <span m='1531000'>This is the quantum nature\
  \ of the hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='1534000'>There are allowed energy levels.</span>\
  \ <span m='1537000'>Where did this quantization come from?</span> <span m='1540000'>It\
  \ came from solving the Schr\xF6dinger equation.</span> <span m='1544000'>When you\
  \ solve a differential equation, as you will learn,</span> <span m='1549000'>and\
  \ that differential equation applies to some physical</span> <span m='1554000'>problem,\
  \ in order to make that differential equation specific</span> <span m='1559000'>to\
  \ your physical problem, you often have to apply</span> <span m='1563000'>something\
  \ called boundary conditions to the problem.</span> <span m='1569000'>When you do\
  \ that, that is when this quantization</span> <span m='1573000'>comes out. It drops\
  \ out of solving the</span> <span m='1576000'>differential equation. What are boundary\
  \ conditions?</span> <span m='1581000'>Well, remember I told you in the spherical\
  \ coordinate system,</span> <span m='1587000'>r, theta, phi? Well, phi sweeps from\
  \ zero to</span> <span m='1590000'>360 degrees. Well, if you just went 90</span>\
  \ <span m='1595000'>degrees further, so if you went to 450 degrees,</span> <span\
  \ m='1598000'>you really have the same situation as you had when phi</span> <span\
  \ m='1603000'>was equal to 90 degrees. What you have to do in a</span> <span m='1607000'>differential\
  \ equation, which usually has a series as a</span> <span m='1611000'>solution, is\
  \ that you have to cut it off.</span> <span m='1614000'>You have to apply boundary\
  \ conditions.</span> <span m='1617000'>You have to cut it off at degrees.</span>\
  \ <span m='1622000'>Because otherwise you just have the same problem that you had</span>\
  \ <span m='1626000'>before. This is a cyclical boundary</span> <span m='1629000'>condition.\
  \ And it is that cutting it off</span> <span m='1632000'>to make the equation be\
  \ really pertinent or apply to your</span> <span m='1636000'>physical problem, that\
  \ is what leads to these</span> <span m='1640000'>boundary conditions, mathematically.</span>\
  \ <span m='1643000'>That is where it comes from. That is where all the</span> <span\
  \ m='1647000'>quantization comes from. Now, let's talk a little bit</span> <span\
  \ m='1652000'>about the significance here of these binding energies because</span>\
  \ <span m='1658000'>somebody asked me about it already.</span> <span m='1661000'>When\
  \ the electron is bound to the nucleus with this much</span> <span m='1667000'>energy,\
  \ we say that the electron is in the n equals 1 state,</span> <span m='1672000'>or\
  \ equivalently, we say that the hydrogen atom</span> <span m='1677000'>is in the\
  \ n equals 1 state. We use both kinds of</span> <span m='1682000'>expressions equivalently.\
  \ When the hydrogen atom or the</span> <span m='1687000'>electron is in the n equals\
  \ 1 state, we call that the ground</span> <span m='1693000'>state. The ground state\
  \ is the lowest</span> <span m='1696000'>energy state. The electron is most strongly</span>\
  \ <span m='1700000'>bound there. The binding energy is most</span> <span m='1703000'>negative.\
  \ And the physical significance</span> <span m='1706000'>of that binding energy\
  \ is that it is minus the ionization</span> <span m='1712000'>energy. Or, alternatively,</span>\
  \ <span m='1715000'>the ionization energy is minus the binding energy.</span> <span\
  \ m='1720000'>It is going to require this much energy, from here to here,</span>\
  \ <span m='1726000'>to rip the electron off of the nucleus.</span> <span m='1730000'>The\
  \ binding energy here is minus the ionization energy.</span> <span m='1736000'>That\
  \ is the physical significance of it.</span> <span m='1741000'>Now, did you ask\
  \ me about the work function?</span> <span m='1744000'>Okay. The work function is\
  \ the</span> <span m='1747000'>ionization energy when we talk about a solid.</span>\
  \ <span m='1751000'>That is just a terminology, that is historical.</span> <span\
  \ m='1755000'>When we talk about ripping and electron off of a solid,</span> <span\
  \ m='1760000'>we call it the work function. When we talk about ripping it</span>\
  \ <span m='1765000'>off of an atom or a molecule, we call it the ionization</span>\
  \ <span m='1770000'>energy. And the other important thing</span> <span m='1774000'>to\
  \ know here is that when we talk about ionization energy,</span> <span m='1779000'>we\
  \ are usually talking about the energy required to pull the</span> <span m='1784000'>electron\
  \ off when the molecule or the atom is in the lowest</span> <span m='1790000'>energy\
  \ state, the ground state.</span> <span m='1792000'>That is also important. But\
  \ our equations tell us we</span> <span m='1797000'>also can have a hydrogen atom\
  \ in the n equals 2 state.</span> <span m='1803000'>If the hydrogen atom is in the\
  \ n equals 2 state,</span> <span m='1806000'>it is in an excited state. Actually,\
  \ it is the first</span> <span m='1811000'>excited state. The electron is bound\
  \ less</span> <span m='1814000'>strongly. It is bound less strongly,</span> <span\
  \ m='1817000'>and consequently, the ionization energy from an</span> <span m='1821000'>excited\
  \ state hydrogen atom is less because the electron is not</span> <span m='1826000'>bound\
  \ so strongly. And, of course,</span> <span m='1830000'>we could have a hydrogen\
  \ at n equals 3, n equals 4 and n</span> <span m='1834000'>equals 5, any of these\
  \ allowed energy levels.</span> <span m='1838000'>Not all at the same time, but,\
  \ at any given time,</span> <span m='1842000'>if you had a lot of hydrogen atoms,\
  \ you could have hydrogen</span> <span m='1847000'>atoms in all of these different\
  \ states.</span> <span m='1850000'>Now, the other point that I want to make is that\
  \ this</span> <span m='1854000'>Schr\xF6dinger result, here, for the energy levels</span>\
  \ <span m='1858000'>predicts the energy levels of all one electron atoms.</span>\
  \ <span m='1864000'>What is a one electron atom? Well, helium plus,</span> <span\
  \ m='1867000'>that is a one electron atom or a one electron ion.</span> <span m='1871000'>Helium\
  \ usually has two electrons, but if we pull one</span> <span m='1875000'>off it\
  \ only has one left, so it is a one electron atom.</span> <span m='1879000'>Lithium\
  \ double plus is a one electron atom because</span> <span m='1883000'>we pulled\
  \ two of its three electrons off.</span> <span m='1886000'>One electron is left,\
  \ and that is a one electron atom</span> <span m='1890000'>or an ion. Uranium plus\
  \ 91 is</span> <span m='1894000'>a one electron atom. We pulled 91 electrons off,</span>\
  \ <span m='1898000'>we have one left, and that is a one electron</span> <span m='1902000'>atom.\
  \ The Schr\xF6dinger equation will</span> <span m='1905000'>predict what those energy\
  \ levels are, as long as you remember the</span> <span m='1911000'>Z squared up\
  \ here. For hydrogen,</span> <span m='1913000'>Z is 1, and so it doesn't appear.</span>\
  \ <span m='1916000'>But Z is not one for all of these other one electron atoms.</span>\
  \ <span m='1923000'>Where does the Z come from? It comes from the Coulomb</span>\
  \ <span m='1927000'>interaction. That potential energy of</span> <span m='1930000'>interaction\
  \ is the charge on the electron times the charge on the</span> <span m='1935000'>nucleus,\
  \ which is Z times e. That is where the Z squared</span> <span m='1939000'>comes\
  \ from. We have to remember that.</span> <span m='1942000'>Now, how do we know that\
  \ the Schr\xF6dinger's predictions for</span> <span m='1947000'>these energy levels\
  \ are correct, are accurate?</span> <span m='1952000'>Well, we have to do an experiment.</span>\
  \ <span m='1954000'>The experiment we are going to do is we are going to take a</span>\
  \ <span m='1959000'>bulb here, pump it out, and then we are going to fill</span>\
  \ <span m='1963000'>it up with molecular hydrogen. And then in this bulb,</span>\
  \ <span m='1967000'>there is a negative and a positive electrode.</span> <span m='1971000'>What\
  \ we are going to do is crank up the potential energy</span> <span m='1975000'>difference\
  \ between those two so high until finally that gas is</span> <span m='1980000'>going\
  \ to ignite, just like that.</span> <span m='1984000'>And we are going to look at\
  \ the light coming out.</span> <span m='1988000'>And what we are going to do is\
  \ we are going to disperse that</span> <span m='1993000'>light. We are going to\
  \ send it through</span> <span m='1996000'>a diffraction grating, essentially.</span>\
  \ <span m='1999000'>And that is like an array of slits.</span> <span m='2002000'>What\
  \ you are going to see are points of constructive and</span> <span m='2006000'>destructive\
  \ interference. But in the constructive</span> <span m='2011000'>interference, you\
  \ are going to see the color</span> <span m='2014000'>separated. There is going\
  \ to be purple,</span> <span m='2017000'>blue, green, etc.</span> <span m='2018000'>The\
  \ reason is that the different radiation,</span> <span m='2021000'>the different\
  \ colors have different wavelengths.</span> <span m='2025000'>They have different\
  \ wavelengths, then they have</span> <span m='2028000'>slightly different points\
  \ in space at which constructive</span> <span m='2032000'>interference occurs, and\
  \ so the light is dispersed</span> <span m='2036000'>in space. We are going to analyze\
  \ what</span> <span m='2040000'>the wavelengths of the light that are being emitted\
  \ from</span> <span m='2044000'>these hydrogen atoms are. See, the discharge pulls\
  \ apart</span> <span m='2048000'>the H two and makes hydrogen atoms.</span> <span\
  \ m='2052000'>We have to do this by taking a diffraction grating.</span> <span m='2056000'>The\
  \ TAs are going to give you a pair of diffraction grating</span> <span m='2060000'>glasses.\
  \ You are supposed to come and</span> <span m='2063000'>look at the discharge here.\
  \ You can see it.</span> <span m='2068000'>I will turn it a little bit for those\
  \ of you on the sides here.</span> <span m='2072000'>And we will see what we see.</span>\
  \ <span m='2100000'>If you cannot see the lamp, you are welcome to get up and</span>\
  \ <span m='2103000'>move around so that you can see it.</span> <span m='2120000'>Can\
  \ you do this light, too?</span> <span m='2121000'>This one over here, sir.</span>\
  \ <span m='2123000'>Can you move this one away?</span> <span m='2135000'>If you\
  \ look up at the lights in the room, you can see the whole</span> <span m='2138000'>spectrum,\
  \ because that is white light.</span> <span m='2168000'>I am going to turn the lamp\
  \ over here so that you can see</span> <span m='2173000'>this a little better. The\
  \ spectrum that you should</span> <span m='2178000'>see is what is shown on the\
  \ board.</span> <span m='2181000'>If you look to the right of the lamp, here, you\
  \ should see a</span> <span m='2187000'>purple line. The purple line is actually</span>\
  \ <span m='2192000'>very light, so only if you are up close are you going to see</span>\
  \ <span m='2196000'>the purple line. You can see the blue line very</span> <span\
  \ m='2199000'>well. That is very intense.</span> <span m='2201000'>The green line\
  \ is also very diffuse.</span> <span m='2204000'>Again, only if you are close are\
  \ you going to be able to see</span> <span m='2208000'>the green line. And then,\
  \ the red line is very</span> <span m='2212000'>bright. And now I am going to move\
  \ this</span> <span m='2215000'>over here so you have the opportunity to see it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2220000'>Again, you are welcome to get out of your seats and move</span>\
  \ <span m='2229000'>around so that you can, in fact, see it.</span> <span m='2235000'>What\
  \ you should be seeing, hey, interference phenomena</span> <span m='2244000'>works.\
  \ Useful pointer.</span> <span m='2260000'>What you should see, depending on which\
  \ one of the</span> <span m='2263000'>constructive interference patterns you are\
  \ looking at,</span> <span m='2268000'>there should be a purple line, there should\
  \ be a blue line,</span> <span m='2273000'>very intense, purple is weak,</span>\
  \ <span m='2275000'>green is rather week, and the red is very intense.</span> <span\
  \ m='2280000'>What is happening, here?</span> <span m='2282000'>Well, what is happening\
  \ is that in this discharge,</span> <span m='2286000'>there is enough energy to\
  \ put some of the hydrogen atoms in a</span> <span m='2292000'>high energy state.\
  \ And we will call that state E</span> <span m='2297000'>sub i, the energy of the\
  \ initial</span> <span m='2301000'>state. Actually, that is an unstable</span> <span\
  \ m='2304000'>situation. That hydrogen atom wants to</span> <span m='2308000'>relax.\
  \ It wants to be in the lower</span> <span m='2312000'>energy state. And what happens\
  \ is that it</span> <span m='2316000'>does relax. It relaxes.</span> <span m='2318000'>The\
  \ electron falls into the lower energy state,</span> <span m='2322000'>but, because\
  \ it is lower energy, it has to give up a</span> <span m='2327000'>photon. And so\
  \ the photon that is</span> <span m='2330000'>emitted, the energy of that photon\
  \ has to be exactly the</span> <span m='2336000'>difference in energy between the\
  \ energy of the initial state and</span> <span m='2342000'>the final state. That\
  \ is the quantum nature of</span> <span m='2347000'>the hydrogen atom. The photon\
  \ that comes out has</span> <span m='2352000'>to have that energy difference exactly.</span>\
  \ <span m='2355000'>And, therefore, the frequency,</span> <span m='2358000'>here,\
  \ of the radiation coming out is going to correspond to</span> <span m='2364000'>that\
  \ exact energy difference. And, for the different</span> <span m='2369000'>energies,\
  \ for the different transitions, you are going to</span> <span m='2373000'>have\
  \ very specific values of the frequency of the radiation or</span> <span m='2378000'>the\
  \ wavelength of the radiation. For example,</span> <span m='2381000'>some of those\
  \ hydrogen atoms in this discharge have been excited</span> <span m='2386000'>to\
  \ this excited state, which we will call B.</span> <span m='2389000'>The energy\
  \ difference between B and this ground state here is</span> <span m='2394000'>small.\
  \ Therefore, we are going to have</span> <span m='2398000'>some radiation that is\
  \ low frequency because delta E,</span> <span m='2401000'>the difference in the\
  \ energy between the two states is small.</span> <span m='2405000'>And then there\
  \ are going to be some hydrogen atoms that are</span> <span m='2409000'>going to\
  \ be excited to this state, the A state.</span> <span m='2412000'>And, relatively\
  \ speaking, that energy difference is</span> <span m='2415000'>large. There are\
  \ going to be some</span> <span m='2417000'>hydrogen atoms that are going to be\
  \ relaxing to this ground</span> <span m='2421000'>state. And when they do,</span>\
  \ <span m='2423000'>since that energy difference is large, the frequency of the</span>\
  \ <span m='2427000'>radiation coming off is going to be high.</span> <span m='2431000'>Or,\
  \ correspondingly, the wavelength of the radiation</span> <span m='2435000'>coming\
  \ off is going to be low because the wavelength is</span> <span m='2439000'>inversely\
  \ proportional to the frequency.</span> <span m='2442000'>And, likewise, for this\
  \ transition we are</span> <span m='2445000'>going to have some long wavelength\
  \ radiation emitted.</span> <span m='2450000'>Well, let's see if we can understand\
  \ specifically the</span> <span m='2454000'>spectrum, here, in the visible range\
  \ for the</span> <span m='2457000'>hydrogen atom. What I have done is to draw an</span>\
  \ <span m='2463000'>energy level diagram again. Here is the energy of n equals</span>\
  \ <span m='2469000'>1, n equals 2, n equals 3, etc.</span> <span m='2472000'>Here\
  \ is the n equals infinity, up here.</span> <span m='2476000'>It turns out that\
  \ this purple line is a transition from a</span> <span m='2482000'>hydrogen atom\
  \ in the n equals 6 state to the n equals 2 state.</span> <span m='2490000'>That\
  \ blue line is a transition from n equals 5 to n equals 2,</span> <span m='2496000'>the\
  \ green line is a transition from n equals 4 to n equals 2</span> <span m='2503000'>and\
  \ the red line from n equals 3 to n equals 2.</span> <span m='2508000'>Notice that\
  \ since this energy difference here is small,</span> <span m='2514000'>this line\
  \ has a long wavelength.</span> <span m='2519000'>Since this energy difference is\
  \ larger, this line has a shorter</span> <span m='2524000'>wavelength. All of these\
  \ transitions that</span> <span m='2528000'>you are seeing in the visible range\
  \ have the final state of n</span> <span m='2533000'>equals 2. Now, how do we know\
  \ that the</span> <span m='2536000'>Schr\xF6dinger equation is making predictions\
  \ that are consistent</span> <span m='2542000'>with the frequencies or the wavelengths\
  \ of the radiation</span> <span m='2547000'>that we observe here? Well, we have\
  \ got to do a plug</span> <span m='2552000'>here. This is the frequency that we</span>\
  \ <span m='2554000'>would expect. It is the energy difference</span> <span m='2557000'>between\
  \ two states over H. Here is the initial energy.</span> <span m='2560000'>Here is\
  \ the final energy. We said that the Schr\xF6dinger</span> <span m='2564000'>equation\
  \ tells us that the energies of the state are minus</span> <span m='2568000'>R sub\
  \ H over n.</span> <span m='2570000'>For the initial energy level, it is minus R\
  \ sub H over n sub</span> <span m='2574000'>i squared. We plug</span> <span m='2577000'>that\
  \ in. For the final energy level,</span> <span m='2581000'>well, it is minus R sub\
  \ H over n sub f,</span> <span m='2585000'>the final quantum number squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='2588000'>We plug that in. We rearrange some things.</span> <span m='2591000'>And\
  \ then this is the prediction for the frequency.</span> <span m='2595000'>I said\
  \ that this level right here is the n equals 2 level,</span> <span m='2600000'>so\
  \ we will plug in the two for the final quantum state.</span> <span m='2604000'>And\
  \ so this is then the prediction for the frequencies</span> <span m='2608000'>of\
  \ the radiation to the n equals 2 level.</span> <span m='2613000'>You just plug\
  \ in n equals 6, n equals 5, n equals 4,</span> <span m='2617000'>n equals 3. And\
  \ you know what?</span> <span m='2619000'>The frequencies that are predicted match\
  \ what we observe</span> <span m='2623000'>to one part in 10^8. There really is\
  \ precise</span> <span m='2626000'>agreement between the results of the Schr\xF6\
  dinger equation and</span> <span m='2631000'>what we actually observe in nature,\
  \ therefore,</span> <span m='2635000'>we think it is correct. And there are no experiments</span>\
  \ <span m='2641000'>that cast any doubt, so far, on the Schr\xF6dinger</span> <span\
  \ m='2646000'>equation. Now, the set of transitions</span> <span m='2649000'>that\
  \ we just looked at are these transitions.</span> <span m='2654000'>Plotted here\
  \ is another energy-level diagram for the</span> <span m='2660000'>hydrogen atom.\
  \ Here is the n equals 1 state,</span> <span m='2664000'>n equals 2, n equals 3,\
  \ n equals 4.</span> <span m='2670000'>And we looked at all the transitions that\
  \ end up in the n</span> <span m='2674000'>equals 2 state. This set of transitions.</span>\
  \ <span m='2676000'>It is called the Balmer series. Now, the n equals 2 state is</span>\
  \ <span m='2681000'>not the ground state. There is a transition from n</span> <span\
  \ m='2684000'>equals 6 to n equals 1, the ground state.</span> <span m='2687000'>It\
  \ is this one right here. But, you see,</span> <span m='2690000'>that is a very\
  \ high energy transition.</span> <span m='2693000'>Actually, this transition, from\
  \ n equals 6 to n equals 1,</span> <span m='2697000'>is in the ultraviolet range\
  \ of the electromagnetic spectrum.</span> <span m='2703000'>And so you cannot see\
  \ it with the experiment that we did,</span> <span m='2706000'>but it is there.\
  \ And then, of course,</span> <span m='2709000'>the hydrogen atoms that relaxed\
  \ to n equals 2,</span> <span m='2712000'>well, they actually eventually relax to\
  \ n equals 1.</span> <span m='2716000'>And there is a transition there, it is over\
  \ here,</span> <span m='2719000'>n equals 2 to n equals 1. But, again, that is a\
  \ high</span> <span m='2723000'>energy transition. It is also in the ultraviolet</span>\
  \ <span m='2726000'>range of the electromagnetic spectrum.</span> <span m='2730000'>And\
  \ so all of these transitions that end up in n equals 1 are in</span> <span m='2734000'>the\
  \ UV range. They are called the Lyman</span> <span m='2736000'>series. All the transitions\
  \ that end up</span> <span m='2738000'>in n equals 2 are in the visible.</span>\
  \ <span m='2740000'>They are called the Balmer. n equals 3, the Paschen,</span>\
  \ <span m='2744000'>is in the infrared. Brackett is in the infrared.</span> <span\
  \ m='2747000'>Pfund is in the infrared. And so we cannot see these</span> <span\
  \ m='2750000'>easily. Now, these are named for the</span> <span m='2752000'>different\
  \ discoverers. The reason there are so many</span> <span m='2755000'>discovers is\
  \ because these are all different frequency ranges.</span> <span m='2761000'>Different\
  \ frequencies of radiation require different</span> <span m='2764000'>kinds of detectors.\
  \ And so, depending on exactly</span> <span m='2768000'>what kind of detector the\
  \ experimentalist had,</span> <span m='2771000'>that will dictate then which one\
  \ of these sets of transitions</span> <span m='2776000'>he was able to discover.\
  \ But not only does this work for</span> <span m='2780000'>emission, but this also\
  \ works for absorption.</span> <span m='2784000'>That is, we can have a hydrogen\
  \ atom in the ground state,</span> <span m='2788000'>a low energy state. And if\
  \ there is a photon around</span> <span m='2793000'>that is exactly the energy difference\
  \ between these two</span> <span m='2797000'>states, well, that photon can be absorbed.</span>\
  \ <span m='2800000'>If that photon is a little bit higher in energy,</span> <span\
  \ m='2804000'>it won't be absorbed. If it is a little lower,</span> <span m='2807000'>it\
  \ won't be absorbed. It has to be exactly the</span> <span m='2810000'>difference\
  \ in the energies between these two states.</span> <span m='2814000'>Again, that\
  \ is the quantum nature of the hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='2820000'>And now,\
  \ if you are calculating the frequency for absorption,</span> <span m='2824000'>what\
  \ I have done here is I have reversed n sub i and n</span> <span m='2829000'>sub\
  \ f. This is 1 over n sub i squared</span> <span m='2832000'>instead of 1 over n\
  \ sub f squared,</span> <span m='2837000'>which was the case in emission. And I\
  \ have reversed this so</span> <span m='2841000'>that you get a positive value for\
  \ the frequency of the</span> <span m='2845000'>radiation absorbed. We will have\
  \ two different</span> <span m='2848000'>equations for absorption and for emission.</span>\
  \ <span m='2853000'>So, those are the Schr\xF6dinger equation results.</span> <span\
  \ m='2856000'>I forgot to announce that there is a forum this evening from</span>\
  \ <span m='2860000'>5:00 to 6:00. You should have signed up in</span> <span m='2864000'>recitation.\
  \ If you didn't,</span> <span m='2865000'>and still want to come, send us an email\
  \ and come.</span> <span m='2869000'>And we need the diffraction glasses back as\
  \ you are exiting.</span> <span m='2874000'>See you Friday.</span> </p>"
