  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>Some of you will recognize\
  \ this molecule that I have rotating up</span> <span m='20000'>on the screen because\
  \ it is one of the coordination complexes of</span> <span m='26000'>Werner that\
  \ we talked about last time.</span> <span m='30000'>And Werner, of course, was well-known.</span>\
  \ <span m='33000'>And some of you probably read is biography over the last few</span>\
  \ <span m='38000'>days on the Nobel Prize website. Well-known for his theory that</span>\
  \ <span m='43000'>broke down the preconceived notions that had been prevailing</span>\
  \ <span m='48000'>at that time concerning the structure of systems that have</span>\
  \ <span m='52000'>unusual salt-like behavior in some cases, but that contain the</span>\
  \ <span m='57000'>3D elements. I am focusing on 3D,</span> <span m='61000'>but this\
  \ is also true of 4D and 5D elements, the transition</span> <span m='66000'>metals.\
  \ Elements like titanium,</span> <span m='69000'>vanadium, chromium, iron, cobalt,</span>\
  \ <span m='71000'>nickel, etc. This molecule here,</span> <span m='74000'>that you\
  \ see spinning up on the screen, is being represented</span> <span m='79000'>here\
  \ on the screen in one of these kind of arbitrary forms,</span> <span m='84000'>wherein\
  \ the cobalt center at the middle of the molecule is</span> <span m='89000'>just\
  \ a round ball of an arbitrary size.</span> <span m='94000'>And then, this particular\
  \ molecule that contains a cobalt</span> <span m='98000'>three ion is surrounded\
  \ by a compliment of</span> <span m='103000'>six ligands. We have three chloride\
  \ ligands,</span> <span m='106000'>that because this program chose to do so colored\
  \ those chlorides</span> <span m='112000'>the same as the cobalt, not what I would\
  \ do,</span> <span m='115000'>and put the three ammonia ligands, colored the ammonia</span>\
  \ <span m='120000'>nitrogens in dark blue, and the ammonia hydrogens in</span> <span\
  \ m='124000'>white. And we talked about the fact</span> <span m='128000'>that these\
  \ transition elements, in fact, these 3+ ions of</span> <span m='132000'>metals\
  \ like cobalt, can behave simultaneously as</span> <span m='136000'>Lewis acids\
  \ toward a multitude of Lewis bases,</span> <span m='140000'>here six. This is a\
  \ times six Lewis acid</span> <span m='143000'>in the middle and six Lewis bases,\
  \ which are three chloride</span> <span m='148000'>ions and three ammonia molecules\
  \ oriented around it,</span> <span m='152000'>in an arrangement that is quasi-octahedral.</span>\
  \ <span m='157000'>Because the positions of the three nitrogens of the ammonias</span>\
  \ <span m='161000'>that are interacting with the cobalt center and the three</span>\
  \ <span m='165000'>chloride ions are located near the vertices of a regular</span>\
  \ <span m='169000'>octahedron. So we will be taking use of the</span> <span m='172000'>geometry\
  \ of molecules like this in discussing electronic</span> <span m='176000'>structure\
  \ properties of these molecules today.</span> <span m='180000'>We will be doing\
  \ that beginning today.</span> <span m='182000'>And that will be important to understanding\
  \ the magnetism and</span> <span m='186000'>the color and also the reactions of\
  \ molecules like this.</span> <span m='189000'>Now, one other arbitrary thing that\
  \ this program did is it</span> <span m='193000'>chose not to draw lines between\
  \ the cobalt and any of the six</span> <span m='197000'>ligands. But normally,</span>\
  \ <span m='198000'>when you see these molecules drawn in textbooks,</span> <span\
  \ m='201000'>you will see that the lines drawn are the same as the lines</span>\
  \ <span m='205000'>between the nitrogens and these hydrogens.</span> <span m='209000'>So\
  \ we would have to add six more lines to this drawing to</span> <span m='213000'>get\
  \ the typical textbook representation of a molecule</span> <span m='217000'>like\
  \ this. But, still, that would be a</span> <span m='220000'>somewhat arbitrary representation.</span>\
  \ <span m='223000'>And so, I would like to show you a less arbitrary</span> <span\
  \ m='227000'>representation. And we will do that forthwith.</span> <span m='231000'>And\
  \ this one has to do with looking at the same molecule,</span> <span m='235000'>but\
  \ represented as an electron density isosurface.</span> <span m='241000'>And that\
  \ isosurface will be colored according to this</span> <span m='245000'>function,\
  \ that tells us about the propensity to pair electrons</span> <span m='250000'>in\
  \ 3D space. And so you will recall that</span> <span m='253000'>when we talk about\
  \ coloring electron density isosurfaces in</span> <span m='257000'>this way, so\
  \ this now is a physically important kind of</span> <span m='262000'>representation\
  \ of this coordination complex,</span> <span m='265000'>this color scale will run\
  \ from red all the way to blue.</span> <span m='271000'>And at blue is where you\
  \ find regions in space where you are</span> <span m='274000'>most likely to find\
  \ pairs of electrons mapped onto the value</span> <span m='278000'>here, colored\
  \ mapped onto the value of an electron density</span> <span m='282000'>isosurface.\
  \ Here the value of the electron</span> <span m='285000'>density that is present\
  \ for every point represented on this</span> <span m='288000'>surface is 0.11 electrons\
  \ per unit volume.</span> <span m='291000'>And so what you see here is that, in\
  \ fact,</span> <span m='294000'>the electron density does become low as you move\
  \ from the</span> <span m='297000'>cobalt in the direction of any one of the ligands.</span>\
  \ <span m='302000'>But the lone pair on each ammonia is certainly polarized</span>\
  \ <span m='305000'>in the direction of the cobalt center.</span> <span m='308000'>And\
  \ the cobalt center is not uniform in terms of the way that</span> <span m='312000'>electron\
  \ density is organized around it.</span> <span m='314000'>You will see that right\
  \ on the metal center,</span> <span m='317000'>we see red. And then sort of at the\
  \ corners</span> <span m='320000'>of a cube, you see this yellow or green color\
  \ on the cobalt,</span> <span m='324000'>and that is very significant. And what\
  \ we are going to be</span> <span m='328000'>today is we are going to try to understand\
  \ what happens when you</span> <span m='333000'>put a set of ligands into an octahedral\
  \ array around a</span> <span m='337000'>central metal ion that has d-electrons\
  \ and d orbitals to</span> <span m='341000'>play with. And, in fact,</span> <span\
  \ m='342000'>what you will see is that the oxidation state of the cobalt</span>\
  \ <span m='346000'>center here is +3. That is why I am referring to</span> <span\
  \ m='350000'>it as a cobalt plus three ion.</span> <span m='353000'>And because\
  \ cobalt is in group nine of the periodic table,</span> <span m='357000'>you then\
  \ know that there are six valance electrons on the</span> <span m='361000'>cobalt\
  \ center that you have to put into orbitals.</span> <span m='366000'>And so what\
  \ we are really seeking to know is how can we</span> <span m='369000'>get an energy-level\
  \ diagram for a system like this,</span> <span m='372000'>so we will know how to\
  \ put those six electrons into that</span> <span m='375000'>diagram, the ones that\
  \ are mostly localized on the cobalt,</span> <span m='379000'>and make predictions\
  \ on whether the electrons should be paired</span> <span m='382000'>up or not, for\
  \ example. We saw with homonuclear</span> <span m='385000'>diatomics, like the dioxygen\
  \ molecule, that electrons are not</span> <span m='389000'>all paired up. Two of\
  \ the electrons are</span> <span m='392000'>unpaired. And, when we have six electrons</span>\
  \ <span m='395000'>to put into an energy-level diagram for the cobalt ion,</span>\
  \ <span m='399000'>we are going to wonder just what the case is.</span> <span m='402000'>How\
  \ many energy levels are there, and where do we put the</span> <span m='407000'>electrons?\
  \ And so we are going to need to</span> <span m='410000'>very briefly review what\
  \ I did at end of lecture last time.</span> <span m='414000'>And that has to do\
  \ with the properties of the five d</span> <span m='418000'>orbitals -- -- because,\
  \ in order to answer</span> <span m='422000'>the kinds of questions that we are\
  \ posing about energy levels</span> <span m='428000'>of metal ions that are transition\
  \ metals,</span> <span m='431000'>we are going to really need to know very well\
  \ the nodal</span> <span m='436000'>properties of these d orbitals. And so, remember\
  \ the m quantum</span> <span m='442000'>number here can be zero for the d z squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='447000'>It can be plus one for the d(xz).</span> <span m='451000'>And\
  \ plus two for the d x squared minus y squared.</span> <span m='458000'>Minus one\
  \ for the d(yz)</span> <span m='463000'>orbital. And minus two for the d(xy)</span>\
  \ <span m='468000'>orbital. And let's draw those.</span> <span m='472000'>d z squared\
  \ is an interesting one.</span> <span m='480000'>And, because it is distinct from\
  \ the other four d orbitals,</span> <span m='484000'>we are going to be spending\
  \ more time on it today than the</span> <span m='489000'>others. What it has,</span>\
  \ <span m='491000'>these are the x, let's say y and z axes here,</span> <span m='494000'>is\
  \ it has a positive lobe along both plus and minus z.</span> <span m='499000'>So\
  \ it looks like a p orbital so far, except that we have the</span> <span m='504000'>same\
  \ sign both in plus or minus z.</span> <span m='508000'>And then what we have is\
  \ a very interesting toroidal shape that</span> <span m='512000'>goes around in\
  \ the x,y-plane all the way around in a</span> <span m='516000'>cylindrically symmetric\
  \ manner. And so, if you were to look</span> <span m='520000'>down z onto this orbital,\
  \ it might look something like</span> <span m='524000'>this.</span> <span m='532000'>Like\
  \ that. It would be cylindrically</span> <span m='534000'>symmetric about z. And\
  \ that was another feature</span> <span m='538000'>that I didn't get to add to this\
  \ diagram at the end of last hour,</span> <span m='543000'>which is that because\
  \ of this property, this m equals zero</span> <span m='548000'>that means this is\
  \ a sigma orbital with respect to the</span> <span m='552000'>z-axis. Cylindrically\
  \ symmetric about</span> <span m='556000'>z. And then, let's go to the xz,</span>\
  \ <span m='559000'>since I am making this x, y, and z over here.</span> <span m='562000'>The\
  \ d(xz) has four lobes, and they are in between the x</span> <span m='567000'>and\
  \ z axes, as I am trying to represent here.</span> <span m='577000'>These two are\
  \ kind of coming out in front here,</span> <span m='581000'>and these two back behind.\
  \ And then, the phases go as</span> <span m='586000'>follows. Unshaded is,</span>\
  \ <span m='588000'>again, plus. And then we have the x squared</span> <span m='592000'>minus\
  \ y squared orbital, which has four lobes.</span> <span m='599000'>In fact, the\
  \ shape of xz, x squared minus y squared,</span> <span m='603000'>yz, and xy are\
  \ all the same.</span> <span m='606000'>It's just that they point in different directions\
  \ in space</span> <span m='610000'>with respect to the Cartesian coordinate axes.</span>\
  \ <span m='613000'>x squared minus y squared, like d z squared,</span> <span m='618000'>is\
  \ an orbital whose lobes point along the coordinate</span> <span m='623000'>axes,\
  \ like this. And it is minus along y,</span> <span m='626000'>as the name suggests,\
  \ and plus along x,</span> <span m='629000'>as the name suggests. That is our d\
  \ x squared minus y</span> <span m='634000'>squared orbital.</span> <span m='637000'>And\
  \ then yz is like xz, but let me finish this part</span> <span m='642000'>here.\
  \ If d z squared is</span> <span m='645000'>sigma with respect to z, and you imagine\
  \ looking down z</span> <span m='650000'>onto d(xz), what would that be with respect\
  \ to z?</span> <span m='662000'>Anyone. Pi. Thank you. That would be pi with respect</span>\
  \ <span m='666000'>to z, because the yz plane is a nodal surface for this d</span>\
  \ <span m='670000'>orbital, as is the x,y-plane. And that is what we are trying</span>\
  \ <span m='675000'>to do here, is become familiar with these orbital surfaces.</span>\
  \ <span m='680000'>And, accordingly, now, if you look down z onto</span> <span m='684000'>the\
  \ d x squared minus y squared orbital,</span> <span m='689000'>you are now going\
  \ to see two nodal surfaces when you look</span> <span m='694000'>down it that way.\
  \ Because you are going to see</span> <span m='699000'>that there is one located\
  \ over here.</span> <span m='702000'>That is a plane that contains the z-axis, but\
  \ it bisects the x</span> <span m='707000'>and y axes. And then there is another\
  \ one</span> <span m='710000'>over here, but that is 90 degrees to the first one.</span>\
  \ <span m='715000'>And that makes this one delta with respect to z.</span> <span\
  \ m='720000'>Delta is when you have two nodes that contain the z-axis</span> <span\
  \ m='726000'>and if we are looking down that z-axis.</span> <span m='730000'>And\
  \ then, over here, the d(yz) orbital has its four</span> <span m='736000'>lobes\
  \ between y and z, like that.</span> <span m='740000'>And it is positive between\
  \ y and z, and negative over here,</span> <span m='746000'>as I am shading. And\
  \ this one,</span> <span m='751000'>like d(xz), is pi with respect to z.</span>\
  \ <span m='754000'>And then, over here, we have a d(xy) orbital as our</span> <span\
  \ m='758000'>final orbital. And what you might be able to</span> <span m='761000'>guess,\
  \ we have a sigma with respect to z,</span> <span m='765000'>we have a pair of pi\
  \ with respect to z for m equals plus</span> <span m='769000'>and minus one. We\
  \ also must have a pair of</span> <span m='773000'>delta with respect to z for m\
  \ equals plus and minus two.</span> <span m='779000'>And that means that the d(xy)\
  \ orbital, like d x squared minus</span> <span m='783000'>y squared, must lie in\
  \ the x,y-plane.</span> <span m='788000'>And, in order to be orthogonal to d x squared\
  \ minus y squared,</span> <span m='793000'>we are going to have to rotate it such\
  \ that its four lobes</span> <span m='797000'>point now between the x and y Cartesian\
  \ coordinate axes like</span> <span m='802000'>this, although I am trying to improve\
  \ on that with my</span> <span m='806000'>coloration. That is like that.</span>\
  \ <span m='810000'>Again, this is an orbital perpendicular to z and which has</span>\
  \ <span m='815000'>delta symmetry. And now, the two nodes are,</span> <span m='818000'>in\
  \ fact, the xz and yz coordinate axes.</span> <span m='822000'>Indicating those\
  \ nodal planes there.</span> <span m='825000'>This is certainly the basics for what\
  \ you need to know about</span> <span m='830000'>the d orbitals. And just briefly,</span>\
  \ <span m='833000'>I would like to switch to Athena terminal,</span> <span m='837000'>here,\
  \ to show you that there are ways for you to go ahead and</span> <span m='842000'>visualize\
  \ the orbitals. And I am going to make this</span> <span m='848000'>information\
  \ available to you, so that you can go ahead and do</span> <span m='852000'>this\
  \ yourself in order to visualize these in a way that</span> <span m='856000'>will\
  \ take you right from the equations for the orbitals to</span> <span m='861000'>their\
  \ graphical representation. I think that is really</span> <span m='865000'>important\
  \ to get a good understanding of orbitals.</span> <span m='870000'>Let's zoom this\
  \ a little bit, so that you can begin to see</span> <span m='878000'>it.</span>\
  \ <span m='886000'>This is a worksheet put together that,</span> <span m='889000'>in\
  \ fact, contains all the functional forms for the d</span> <span m='894000'>orbitals.\
  \ Let me see.</span> <span m='896000'>Where is that? Here we go.</span> <span m='900000'>And\
  \ you can look at this with Maple on Athena.</span> <span m='902000'>And then, you\
  \ can look at the equation that represents the</span> <span m='906000'>angular part\
  \ of the wave function for the orbital that</span> <span m='909000'>you are interested\
  \ in. And then, you can go ahead and</span> <span m='912000'>plot it. And you can\
  \ plot it in such a</span> <span m='914000'>way that the function is animated.</span>\
  \ <span m='916000'>And, rather than just seeing it projected on a board as well\
  \ as</span> <span m='920000'>I can draw, you will be able to see it drawn up graphically.</span>\
  \ <span m='925000'>In fact, these come from the solution for the Schr\u02C6dinger</span>\
  \ <span m='930000'>equation for the hydrogen atom. And the angular part of these</span>\
  \ <span m='936000'>wave functions that is going to be oh so important to us is</span>\
  \ <span m='942000'>something known as the set of spherical harmonic equations.</span>\
  \ <span m='948000'>And that should reference you to this issue of standing waves,</span>\
  \ <span m='954000'>that we have discussed. Let's just see what we can do,</span>\
  \ <span m='960000'>here. Sometimes, I am not so good at</span> <span m='963000'>using\
  \ Maple up in front of the class.</span> <span m='971000'>What you are seeing is\
  \ we are getting representations for d z</span> <span m='974000'>squared. Right\
  \ here is a way of writing</span> <span m='977000'>d z squared. You are going to\
  \ see an</span> <span m='979000'>important term here, three cosine squared theta</span>\
  \ <span m='982000'>minus one. And we will come back to that</span> <span m='985000'>in\
  \ a moment. That is the angular part of the</span> <span m='987000'>d z squared\
  \ wave function.</span> <span m='991000'>And then we can look at some of these other\
  \ ones.</span> <span m='994000'>You will see that some of the d orbitals come as\
  \ combinations of</span> <span m='999000'>real and imaginary functions that are\
  \ the solutions to the</span> <span m='1003000'>differential form of the Schr\u02C6\
  dinger equation.</span> <span m='1006000'>And then we take linear combinations of\
  \ these to get</span> <span m='1010000'>real forms, so that we can get plots that\
  \ we can look at.</span> <span m='1014000'>And let's see if we can get d z squared,</span>\
  \ <span m='1018000'>here. There it is.</span> <span m='1020000'>There is a picture\
  \ of d z squared.</span> <span m='1024000'>And you see, if you are using this Maple</span>\
  \ <span m='1027000'>worksheet, that you can actually rotate that around and animate</span>\
  \ <span m='1032000'>it a little bit. You see that we have this torus</span> <span\
  \ m='1036000'>that is in the x,y-plane. And you have the two large</span> <span\
  \ m='1040000'>lobes that extend up along plus and minus z.</span> <span m='1044000'>And\
  \ so I am going to encourage you to go ahead and look at that</span> <span m='1049000'>worksheet,\
  \ which will be available from our website.</span> <span m='1055000'>Go ahead and\
  \ look at some of the functions.</span> <span m='1057000'>And if some of you are\
  \ interested in higher orbitals,</span> <span m='1061000'>the f orbitals are also\
  \ available in this worksheet.</span> <span m='1064000'>So you can visualize the\
  \ f orbitals, that are important for</span> <span m='1068000'>understanding the\
  \ chemistry of elements like,</span> <span m='1071000'>for example, uranium, which\
  \ is a little bit</span> <span m='1074000'>beyond the scope of 5.112. Now let's\
  \ switch to the</span> <span m='1077000'>document camera. And, if you could,</span>\
  \ <span m='1081000'>I would like you to make this part big.</span> <span m='1086000'>This\
  \ is a table in your textbook that has the angular</span> <span m='1091000'>part\
  \ of the wave functions for various hydrogen-like orbitals.</span> <span m='1098000'>And\
  \ this is the part that I am most interested in,</span> <span m='1103000'>over here.\
  \ If you could just focus in on</span> <span m='1108000'>the d orbitals over here.\
  \ When I was talking about the d</span> <span m='1114000'>z squared orbital a moment\
  \ ago, I was focusing on</span> <span m='1118000'>this term here, this cosine squared\
  \ theta minus</span> <span m='1121000'>one term. And here are the other</span> <span\
  \ m='1123000'>d-orbitals. These are the descriptors for</span> <span m='1126000'>the\
  \ d-orbitals, zy, yz, xz, x squared minus y</span> <span m='1129000'>squared, and\
  \ z squared.</span> <span m='1132000'>And I will need to refer to this in a moment,</span>\
  \ <span m='1135000'>so we will leave this up. The reason why I have this</span>\
  \ <span m='1139000'>arrow written into my book here is because these are backwards</span>\
  \ <span m='1143000'>in the text. This one is actually x squared</span> <span m='1146000'>minus\
  \ y squared, and this one is actually the xy</span> <span m='1150000'>orbital. We\
  \ figured that out last year</span> <span m='1153000'>when we were doing this lecture.\
  \ And so your book isn't always</span> <span m='1157000'>right. You should make\
  \ sure you check.</span> <span m='1159000'>The same is certainly true of your instructor,</span>\
  \ <span m='1162000'>but we will try not to mislead you.</span> <span m='1164000'>And\
  \ so now here is the approach that we are going to take.</span> <span m='1180000'>Let's\
  \ say that we have our coordinate system,</span> <span m='1182000'>and we want to\
  \ know how to evaluate one of these d orbital</span> <span m='1186000'>wave functions\
  \ for a particular point in space.</span> <span m='1189000'>Actually, we are going\
  \ to want to evaluate the square of the</span> <span m='1193000'>wave function.\
  \ And so we are going to make use</span> <span m='1196000'>of a Cartesian coordinate\
  \ system.</span> <span m='1198000'>And we are going to express things in terms of\
  \ polar</span> <span m='1202000'>coordinates.</span> <span m='1210000'>Here is a\
  \ sphere projected onto our Cartesian coordinate system.</span> <span m='1215000'>And\
  \ some of you will be very familiar with this.</span> <span m='1220000'>We are going\
  \ to say if you are at a point here in space,</span> <span m='1225000'>then we can\
  \ describe that point in space by a set of variables</span> <span m='1231000'>which\
  \ will be r, theta, and phi.</span> <span m='1235000'>And here is our angle theta.\
  \ And if we drop down to a</span> <span m='1242000'>perpendicular on the x,y-plane\
  \ from our point,</span> <span m='1249000'>then we are going to define phi as being\
  \ from the x-axis and</span> <span m='1258000'>going over in the direction of y.</span>\
  \ <span m='1264000'>And so, when you look at the d orbital wave functions,</span>\
  \ <span m='1268000'>you see that they are all written here in terms of just</span>\
  \ <span m='1273000'>theta and phi, and not in terms of r,</span> <span m='1276000'>which\
  \ is this distance here from the nucleus,</span> <span m='1280000'>from the center\
  \ of this metal ion that we are talking about.</span> <span m='1286000'>This would\
  \ be the r. And what we are going to do,</span> <span m='1290000'>is if this point\
  \ on the surface of our sphere represents one of</span> <span m='1295000'>our ligand\
  \ atoms, so think back to that complex</span> <span m='1298000'>we were describing\
  \ a few moments ago, cobalt with three ammonia</span> <span m='1303000'>ligands\
  \ and three chloride ligands, we are going to</span> <span m='1306000'>approximate\
  \ each of those six ligands by a point on the</span> <span m='1310000'>surface of\
  \ our sphere. And then, we are going to say,</span> <span m='1314000'>if there is\
  \ a metal at the center, that cobalt ion in</span> <span m='1317000'>particular,\
  \ what is the probability of finding a d</span> <span m='1321000'>electron where\
  \ that ligand atom is?</span> <span m='1325000'>And, in order to do that, we are\
  \ going to need to be able</span> <span m='1328000'>to evaluate the wave function.\
  \ And we are making the</span> <span m='1331000'>assumption, for simplicity, that\
  \ this is a perfect sphere,</span> <span m='1334000'>and also that our coordination\
  \ geometry is a perfect</span> <span m='1337000'>octahedron. And so we are not going\
  \ to</span> <span m='1339000'>consider r, because r is going to be the same everywhere.</span>\
  \ <span m='1342000'>It is just a perfect sphere with one value of r,</span> <span\
  \ m='1345000'>no matter which ligand position we are looking at.</span> <span m='1349000'>And\
  \ so that means we can focus in just on these which are the</span> <span m='1353000'>angular\
  \ part of the wave function for the molecule in</span> <span m='1356000'>question.\
  \ And so let's see what this</span> <span m='1359000'>means with respect to d z\
  \ squared.</span> <span m='1374000'>The probability of finding an electron at some\
  \ point in space</span> <span m='1377000'>in a particular atomic orbital is proportional\
  \ to the square of</span> <span m='1381000'>that atomic orbital at that point in\
  \ space.</span> <span m='1385000'>That is our probability density.</span> <span\
  \ m='1387000'>And we encountered that very early in the semester.</span> <span m='1390000'>Now,\
  \ we are going to make use of that to make a plot.</span> <span m='1394000'>We are\
  \ going to plot this probability density of finding</span> <span m='1398000'>electron\
  \ in d z squared as a function of</span> <span m='1402000'>theta. Why can I do that\
  \ ignoring phi?</span> <span m='1405000'>Well, that is because if you look at d\
  \ z squared,</span> <span m='1409000'>there is no phi in that equation.</span> <span\
  \ m='1413000'>Why is that? That is because d z squared</span> <span m='1415000'>is\
  \ cylindrically symmetric about z.</span> <span m='1419000'>And look at how we defined\
  \ phi. It is as you go in the</span> <span m='1422000'>x,y-plane around starting\
  \ from x.</span> <span m='1425000'>Because of the sigma symmetry of d z squared\
  \ with respect to</span> <span m='1429000'>z, there is no phi dependence of this\
  \ wave function.</span> <span m='1433000'>And that should appear here in the angular\
  \ form of the</span> <span m='1437000'>description of the d z squared orbital.</span>\
  \ <span m='1441000'>But we do know that d z squared does depend on theta,</span>\
  \ <span m='1446000'>because theta starts out somewhere here along,</span> <span\
  \ m='1450000'>let's say initially theta equals zero would be right on</span> <span\
  \ m='1455000'>the positive z-axis. And then, as we keep a constant</span> <span\
  \ m='1459000'>r and we sweep down here toward the x,y-plane,</span> <span m='1463000'>the\
  \ d z squared probability density is dropping</span> <span m='1468000'>off. And\
  \ then at some point,</span> <span m='1472000'>when we get to the node here, and\
  \ we are going to be</span> <span m='1476000'>interested in that, it goes to zero,</span>\
  \ <span m='1479000'>because that is what happens on nodes, as we continue down</span>\
  \ <span m='1484000'>toward the x,y-plane past that node, it is going to be nonzero</span>\
  \ <span m='1490000'>again and rise up as we approach this smaller torus in the</span>\
  \ <span m='1495000'>x,y-plane. Smaller, that is,</span> <span m='1497000'>than the\
  \ big lobes that extend up along z and down along minus</span> <span m='1503000'>z.\
  \ Let's represent that</span> <span m='1505000'>graphically.</span> <span m='1514000'>Coming\
  \ down in theta from theta equals zero to some value here,</span> <span m='1520000'>we\
  \ are going to be interested in just what that value is.</span> <span m='1526000'>And\
  \ then, rising up again to theta is equal to pi over two.</span> <span m='1532000'>Do\
  \ you see that? This is another way of</span> <span m='1536000'>displaying this\
  \ property. This is at constant r --</span> <span m='1548000'>-- and varying theta.</span>\
  \ <span m='1556000'>First of all, how can we find out at what</span> <span m='1559000'>value\
  \ theta goes to zero? Well, we look up here at the</span> <span m='1564000'>functional\
  \ form of the d z squared.</span> <span m='1568000'>We get nodal properties of d\
  \ z squared.</span> <span m='1582000'>We can pretty quickly see that in each of\
  \ these,</span> <span m='1585000'>we have a factor leading out in front, which is\
  \ a normalization</span> <span m='1590000'>factor that assures us that the sum integrated\
  \ over all space of</span> <span m='1595000'>this wave function will come out to\
  \ be one.</span> <span m='1599000'>If there is an electron in that orbital somewhere,</span>\
  \ <span m='1602000'>the probability of finding that electron somewhere in space\
  \ will</span> <span m='1605000'>be one. We have these normalizing</span> <span m='1607000'>constants\
  \ out in front that allow for that and ensure that</span> <span m='1611000'>that\
  \ is the case. But where we actually find the</span> <span m='1614000'>angular dependence\
  \ is in that second term.</span> <span m='1616000'>Here it is three cosine squared\
  \ theta minus one.</span> <span m='1630000'>And what we want to do is say, when\
  \ does this function go to</span> <span m='1634000'>zero? Because when that goes\
  \ to zero,</span> <span m='1637000'>we will have this angle here. If we say, let\
  \ this equal zero,</span> <span m='1642000'>we are looking for the value of the\
  \ angle theta which</span> <span m='1646000'>corresponds to the node of the d z\
  \ squared orbital.</span> <span m='1652000'>Remember, we mentioned this last time,\
  \ because of this</span> <span m='1655000'>cylindrical symmetry of the d z squared\
  \ orbital,</span> <span m='1659000'>this really is a conical nodal surface that\
  \ is above and below</span> <span m='1664000'>the plane here. If you are anywhere\
  \ on that</span> <span m='1667000'>cone, either in plus or minus z, the value of\
  \ that d z squared</span> <span m='1671000'>orbital is zero. And so we are setting\
  \ it equal</span> <span m='1675000'>to zero to find the angle theta. And we can\
  \ rearrange this and</span> <span m='1682000'>say that cosine squared theta is equal\
  \ to one over three.</span> <span m='1687000'>And, if we go ahead and solve that,</span>\
  \ <span m='1694000'>this comes out to the arccosine of root three over three.</span>\
  \ <span m='1699000'>And the other possibility that</span> <span m='1705000'>satisfies\
  \ that relation is pi minus the arccosine of root</span> <span m='1711000'>three\
  \ over three</span> <span m='1717000'>And so what that means is that this relation,</span>\
  \ <span m='1721000'>here, gives us the angle for that cone in the plus z axis.</span>\
  \ <span m='1728000'>And then this one down here, pi minus arccosine root three</span>\
  \ <span m='1734000'>over three, gives us the angle for</span> <span m='1741000'>that\
  \ cone down in the minus z-axis.</span> <span m='1745000'>And what is this? This\
  \ is, in degrees,</span> <span m='1749000'>something like 54.476 dot, dot, dot degrees,</span>\
  \ <span m='1754000'>approximately. That is just how far down you</span> <span m='1758000'>are\
  \ from the z-axis when you hit that nodal surface of z.</span> <span m='1767000'>And\
  \ that number, you are going to see,</span> <span m='1769000'>is kind of a magical\
  \ number in chemistry.</span> <span m='1772000'>And it will hearken back to some\
  \ of the things that we have</span> <span m='1777000'>been taking about, recently.</span>\
  \ <span m='1779000'>And, in order to get to that point, I am going to need to now</span>\
  \ <span m='1784000'>talk about our ligands again with respect to d z squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='1807000'>We are considering, now, an octahedral metal</span> <span m='1810000'>complex.</span>\
  \ <span m='1820000'>This is the type of Werner-esque complex that we</span> <span\
  \ m='1824000'>talked about last time. You are going to see that we</span> <span\
  \ m='1829000'>are going to have ligands. We are not really specifying</span> <span\
  \ m='1835000'>them. We are numbering them and</span> <span m='1838000'>locating\
  \ them at positions one, two, three, four,</span> <span m='1843000'>five, and six\
  \ relative to our metal center at the middle.</span> <span m='1850000'>And what\
  \ you might begin to realize is that in order to find</span> <span m='1854000'>out\
  \ what our energy-level diagram will be that refers only</span> <span m='1858000'>to\
  \ the five d orbitals on the cobalt center,</span> <span m='1862000'>or whatever\
  \ metal center is at the middle of this ion,</span> <span m='1866000'>what we are\
  \ going to have to do is evaluate the square of the</span> <span m='1870000'>wave\
  \ function at each of these ligand positions.</span> <span m='1875000'>And we are\
  \ assuming that all the ligands are equivalent.</span> <span m='1879000'>If you\
  \ think of the ligand as an electron or as a point charge</span> <span m='1885000'>in\
  \ space, then you can imagine that if we have an electron in d</span> <span m='1890000'>z\
  \ squared up here, that it is going to interact</span> <span m='1895000'>strongly\
  \ and very repulsively with a point charge that would</span> <span m='1900000'>be\
  \ located at position one. Whereas, if we instead had a</span> <span m='1905000'>point\
  \ charge located at that theta angle of 54 point whatever</span> <span m='1909000'>over\
  \ there that we solved for, since that is on the node of d</span> <span m='1913000'>z\
  \ squared, that would be the least</span> <span m='1916000'>possible repulsive interaction\
  \ that you could get between an</span> <span m='1920000'>electron and an electron\
  \ in d z squared because it is</span> <span m='1924000'>on the node. And so what\
  \ we would like to do</span> <span m='1927000'>is to go ahead and solve for some\
  \ of these things.</span> <span m='1930000'>Essentially, what we seek --</span>\
  \ <span m='1945000'>-- is an energy-level diagram.</span> <span m='1953000'>And\
  \ so let's write this, up here.</span> <span m='1955000'>This is five over 16pi.\
  \ This is d z squared</span> <span m='1959000'>that I am writing up. Three cosine\
  \ squared theta</span> <span m='1963000'>minus one.</span> <span m='1965000'>And\
  \ because we are talking about the probability density of</span> <span m='1970000'>finding\
  \ an electron at a particular point in space,</span> <span m='1974000'>which will\
  \ mean a particular theta value in our case for d z</span> <span m='1978000'>squared,\
  \ we are talking about that wave</span> <span m='1982000'>function squared. What\
  \ we need to do is evaluate</span> <span m='1987000'>it. We have already evaluated\
  \ it</span> <span m='1990000'>where the node is, but we would like to evaluate</span>\
  \ <span m='1994000'>it at position one. Because we have a ligand at</span> <span\
  \ m='1998000'>position one, and we need to know what the</span> <span m='2001000'>relative\
  \ response will be of d z squared to a ligand</span> <span m='2006000'>along position\
  \ one versus the other five positions.</span> <span m='2012000'>We can say something\
  \ about that by symmetry, already.</span> <span m='2015000'>And so we are going\
  \ to find out that the value that you get for</span> <span m='2018000'>evaluating\
  \ d z squared at position one is</span> <span m='2022000'>the same as you would\
  \ get for evaluating it at position six.</span> <span m='2025000'>And that is because\
  \ the big lobes of d z squared</span> <span m='2029000'>are along plus and minus\
  \ z. That is where ligands one and</span> <span m='2032000'>six are. And then, because\
  \ the torus is</span> <span m='2034000'>also cylindrically symmetric, two, three,\
  \ four and five have</span> <span m='2038000'>the same value when you evaluate d\
  \ z squared at those</span> <span m='2042000'>positions. But that value is smaller\
  \ than</span> <span m='2046000'>along z, as illustrated by this graph over here.</span>\
  \ <span m='2050000'>But we just want to know, how much smaller.</span> <span m='2070000'>And\
  \ so this is position one. We get a value of</span> <span m='2073000'>five-quarters.\
  \ And down here,</span> <span m='2076000'>position two, a value of five-sixteenths.</span>\
  \ <span m='2079000'>I am leaving off a factor of pi.</span> <span m='2082000'>Please\
  \ don't be concerned by that.</span> <span m='2085000'>But these are the relative\
  \ values that you get when you</span> <span m='2090000'>evaluate this function at\
  \ ligand positions one and two,</span> <span m='2094000'>which is all we need to\
  \ do because of the symmetry of this</span> <span m='2099000'>because that value\
  \ for position one is also true for position</span> <span m='2105000'>six. So we\
  \ have positions one and</span> <span m='2109000'>six. And then, this is also three,</span>\
  \ <span m='2112000'>four, and five. By doing two quick evaluations</span> <span\
  \ m='2117000'>at two different theta positions, position one,</span> <span m='2121000'>of\
  \ course, theta is equal to zero, up here.</span> <span m='2125000'>And we evaluate\
  \ that squared function for theta equals zero.</span> <span m='2132000'>And we get\
  \ five-fourths pi, but I am leaving off the pi.</span> <span m='2136000'>And down\
  \ here, at position two,</span> <span m='2138000'>we evaluate this for theta equals\
  \ pi over two because two,</span> <span m='2142000'>three, four, and five are all\
  \ in the</span> <span m='2145000'>x,y-plane at 90 degrees to z. So the value of\
  \ theta anywhere</span> <span m='2149000'>for those four ligands would be pi over\
  \ two.</span> <span m='2153000'>You evaluate this function for pi over two, and\
  \ you will get</span> <span m='2157000'>five-sixteenths pi. And I have just left\
  \ off the</span> <span m='2164000'>pi. That is useful.</span> <span m='2166000'>Let's\
  \ take this one up to the top.</span> <span m='2183000'>Here we have done one of\
  \ the d orbitals.</span> <span m='2187000'>This is d z squared for all six ligand\
  \ positions.</span> <span m='2200000'>Now, let's do d x squared minus y squared\
  \ for</span> <span m='2209000'>all six ligand positions.</span> <span m='2218000'>First\
  \ of all, d x squared minus y squared</span> <span m='2220000'>has a pretty interesting\
  \ relationship with</span> <span m='2225000'>ligands one and six. What is that relationship?</span>\
  \ <span m='2237000'>Zero. Because x squared minus y</span> <span m='2239000'>squared\
  \ has two nodal surfaces that intersect</span> <span m='2243000'>along the z-axis.\
  \ And so those ligands,</span> <span m='2246000'>four and six, lie on a nodal surface.</span>\
  \ <span m='2250000'>And so, we know that that is going to be equal to zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2255000'>If, however, we go ahead and evaluate the</span> <span m='2258000'>square\
  \ of d x squared minus y squared, let me just write it</span> <span m='2264000'>up.\
  \ And I have to switch it,</span> <span m='2266000'>since they are wrong in the\
  \ book.</span> <span m='2269000'>15 over 16pi square root sine squared theta cosine\
  \ two phi.</span> <span m='2281000'>We have that. Now, just as we do,</span> <span\
  \ m='2283000'>we are converting an orbital angular property into a</span> <span\
  \ m='2287000'>probability density by squaring it.</span> <span m='2289000'>This\
  \ is what we normally do. When you see pictures of</span> <span m='2293000'>orbitals,\
  \ they are representing the square of the wave function</span> <span m='2298000'>in\
  \ space. We need to evaluate this as a</span> <span m='2301000'>function of theta\
  \ and phi in order to find out what --</span> <span m='2306000'>The first two, one\
  \ and six,</span> <span m='2308000'>we did by inspection, but what about positions\
  \ two,</span> <span m='2311000'>three, four, and five?</span> <span m='2313000'>In\
  \ the case of those four, you can see that where they lie</span> <span m='2317000'>in\
  \ the x,y-plane with respect to the x squared minus y squared</span> <span m='2322000'>orbital\
  \ is all identical to each other by</span> <span m='2326000'>symmetry. Because x\
  \ squared minus y</span> <span m='2329000'>squared has lobes that extend along x\
  \ and plus x and y and</span> <span m='2333000'>minus y. And that is where all these</span>\
  \ <span m='2336000'>ligands lie, at positions two, three, four,</span> <span m='2339000'>and\
  \ five. We know that theta is equal to</span> <span m='2346000'>what? It is going\
  \ to be pi over two.</span> <span m='2351000'>And phi, of course, can be zero pi\
  \ over two pi,</span> <span m='2357000'>and three pi over two for any of those positions.</span>\
  \ <span m='2364000'>And what we will find is that this evaluates --</span> <span\
  \ m='2372000'>For any of those, let's just use phi equals zero.</span> <span m='2377000'>This\
  \ evaluates as 15 over 16pi. And I am dropping the pi.</span> <span m='2383000'>Now\
  \ we have d z squared and d x squared minus</span> <span m='2389000'>y squared evaluated\
  \ for all six ligand</span> <span m='2394000'>positions. And then, let's make a\
  \ table of</span> <span m='2399000'>this.</span> <span m='2423000'>z squared. x\
  \ squared minus y squared.</span> <span m='2427000'>Let's do xz,</span> <span m='2429000'>yz,\
  \ and xy. And here are our ligand</span> <span m='2432000'>positions. And in the\
  \ table here,</span> <span m='2435000'>we are going to put what these relative evaluated\
  \ squared wave</span> <span m='2441000'>functions are. And the biggest one of all\
  \ is</span> <span m='2445000'>this one here that we got at position one for d z\
  \ squared,</span> <span m='2451000'>which is five-fourths.</span> <span m='2456000'>I\
  \ am going to divide everybody through by five-fourths,</span> <span m='2460000'>so\
  \ that I can make our biggest value equal to one for</span> <span m='2463000'>simplicity\
  \ here. And then, when we do that,</span> <span m='2467000'>you are going to see\
  \ that two gives a value of a quarter.</span> <span m='2471000'>That is position\
  \ two, down in the torus.</span> <span m='2474000'>Three, down in the torus, is\
  \ one-quarter relative to that</span> <span m='2478000'>one. Four is one-quarter.</span>\
  \ <span m='2480000'>Five is one-quarter. And six, down in minus z,</span> <span\
  \ m='2483000'>is one. So we have evaluated the d z</span> <span m='2486000'>squared\
  \ orbital squared at the ligand positions</span> <span m='2490000'>one through six.\
  \ And these are the relative</span> <span m='2495000'>values that we got for the\
  \ probability of finding an</span> <span m='2500000'>electron at that point in space,\
  \ given a constant value of r.</span> <span m='2506000'>And x squared minus y squared,</span>\
  \ <span m='2511000'>we got for positions one and six zero, we just said that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2516000'>And then, on the same scale here, we get three-quarter,</span>\
  \ <span m='2522000'>three-quarter, three-quarter,</span> <span m='2524000'>and three-quarter.\
  \ And then for xz,</span> <span m='2529000'>yz, and xy, we have gone through these\
  \ two steps to do z</span> <span m='2535000'>squared and x squared minus y squared\
  \ explicitly.</span> <span m='2541000'>Now, we have to look at where</span> <span\
  \ m='2545000'>ligands one through six are relative to the nodes of xz or</span>\
  \ <span m='2551000'>yz and xy. And what we will find is that,</span> <span m='2557000'>in\
  \ each case, these ligands lie on nodal</span> <span m='2564000'>surfaces of xz,\
  \ yz, and xy.</span> <span m='2568000'>This is zero, zero, zero, zero,</span> <span\
  \ m='2573000'>zero, zero, zero, and so on.</span> <span m='2577000'>Okay? All the\
  \ ligands,</span> <span m='2581000'>one through six, lie on nodal planes of xz,</span>\
  \ <span m='2584000'>yz, and xy. Only four of the ligands</span> <span m='2586000'>interact\
  \ with x squared minus y squared,</span> <span m='2590000'>ligands two through five,\
  \ because those are the ones that</span> <span m='2594000'>lie in the x,y-plane.\
  \ And they interact strongly,</span> <span m='2597000'>this relative value of three-quarters,</span>\
  \ <span m='2600000'>but not as strongly as the two ligands in positions one and\
  \ six</span> <span m='2605000'>interact with the big lobes of d z squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='2610000'>And then, also, ligands two through five,</span> <span m='2612000'>which\
  \ lie in the x,y-plane, interact with the torus of d z</span> <span m='2616000'>squared,\
  \ but to a much smaller extent</span> <span m='2620000'>because the torus does not\
  \ have as great a radial extent.</span> <span m='2624000'>And these ligands are\
  \ all at the same radius out from the</span> <span m='2628000'>metal center. And\
  \ so what this corresponds to</span> <span m='2631000'>is now an energy-level diagram\
  \ as follows.</span> <span m='2634000'>And this is for an octahedral complex, --</span>\
  \ <span m='2643000'>-- where we have relative energy units of zero,</span> <span\
  \ m='2647000'>one, two, and three. And what we have to do is say</span> <span m='2651000'>that\
  \ the amount an electron in d z squared would be</span> <span m='2657000'>repelled\
  \ simultaneously by electrons in positions one</span> <span m='2662000'>through\
  \ six would be the sum of these values.</span> <span m='2667000'>And so we add that\
  \ up and get, in fact for d z squared,</span> <span m='2671000'>up here, a three.</span>\
  \ <span m='2674000'>And, interestingly, for d x squared minus y</span> <span m='2678000'>squared,\
  \ if we take a sum of the four</span> <span m='2682000'>interactions that we found\
  \ that are non-zero,</span> <span m='2686000'>we also get a three for d x squared\
  \ minus y squared.</span> <span m='2690000'>So then the net of all their interactions\
  \ is the same for x</span> <span m='2695000'>squared minus y squared and z squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='2700000'>And then down here, we found that these three</span> <span m='2703000'>orbitals,\
  \ xz, yz, and xy, where the ligands</span> <span m='2707000'>at positions one through\
  \ six lie on their nodal surfaces,</span> <span m='2711000'>lie right on their nodal\
  \ surfaces.</span> <span m='2714000'>And so the number evaluates to zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2717000'>And so a wave function squared will evaluate to zero any time</span>\
  \ <span m='2722000'>you are looking at a position that is on one of its nodal</span>\
  \ <span m='2726000'>surfaces. It evaluates to zero.</span> <span m='2729000'>And\
  \ so we have d(xz), d(yz), and d(xy).</span> <span m='2734000'>And then, a diagram\
  \ like this, which is a d-orbital splitting</span> <span m='2739000'>diagram --</span>\
  \ <span m='2753000'>-- is associated with a couple of different parameters.</span>\
  \ <span m='2756000'>One is, down here we have a triply degenerate energy level.</span>\
  \ <span m='2760000'>Previously, we had only seen doubly degenerate energy levels.</span>\
  \ <span m='2764000'>Now we have a triply degenerate on composed of xz,</span> <span\
  \ m='2768000'>yz, and xy. And that level we are going to</span> <span m='2771000'>be\
  \ calling t(2g). And then, up here,</span> <span m='2774000'>we have a doubly degenerate\
  \ level that will get the label</span> <span m='2779000'>e(g). And then, whatever\
  \ the value of</span> <span m='2782000'>the splitting of these two energy levels,</span>\
  \ <span m='2785000'>one triply and one doubly degenerate, we are going to give</span>\
  \ <span m='2789000'>that the label delta O for octahedral.</span> <span m='2794000'>And\
  \ at the beginning of next hour, I will say more about</span> <span m='2798000'>tables\
  \ like this. And I will show you how you can</span> <span m='2802000'>actually figure\
  \ out d-orbital splitting diagrams for other</span> <span m='2806000'>coordination\
  \ geometries and how they compare for a couple of the</span> <span m='2811000'>most\
  \ popular coordination geometries.</span> </p>"
