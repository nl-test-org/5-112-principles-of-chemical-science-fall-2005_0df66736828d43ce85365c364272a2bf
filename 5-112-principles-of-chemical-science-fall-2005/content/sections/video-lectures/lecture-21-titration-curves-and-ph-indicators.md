  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='20000'>Continuing our discussion
  of acid-base theory,</span> <span m='24000'>I have just drawn here on the board
  for you the structure of a</span> <span m='30000'>popular indicator molecule. Indicator
  molecules are used</span> <span m='36000'>for titrations. And titrations will be
  of focus</span> <span m='40000'>of today's lecture. This is the indicator molecule,</span>
  <span m='45000'>phenolphthalein. It is easier to draw this</span> <span m='49000'>molecular
  structure than it is to spell phenolphthalein,</span> <span m='54000'>but you should
  know how to do both of these things,</span> <span m='58000'>or at least recognize
  them. Now, how do indicator molecules</span> <span m='66000'>work? Well, during
  a titration,</span> <span m='69000'>you are mixing chemicals in a way that leads
  to a changing pH</span> <span m='77000'>throughout the experiment. And an indicator
  molecule like</span> <span m='85000'>phenolphthalein is, in fact, a Bronsted acid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='92000'>And, if you inspect the structure that I have drawn here</span>
  <span m='95000'>for phenolphthalein, you should be able to begin to</span> <span
  m='98000'>understand just how it is that a molecule like this can serve as</span>
  <span m='102000'>a Bronsted acid. If I write out the formula,</span> <span m='105000'>you
  will see that we have quite a number of carbons and</span> <span m='109000'>hydrogens
  in the molecule. And we have oxygens as well.</span> </p><p><span m='112000'>Those
  are the three elements present in a phenolphthalein</span> <span m='116000'>molecule.
  And two of the hydrogens in</span> <span m='120000'>this molecule possess Bronsted
  acidity that makes them valuable</span> <span m='127000'>for the function of this
  system as an indicator molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='133000'>And what happens
  is when you have this in solution at low pH,</span> <span m='139000'>it is in this
  form. It is neutral.</span> </p><p><span m='143000'>And then, as you begin to raise
  the pH, at some point a base</span> <span m='149000'>that has a lone pair of electrons
  comes along and takes</span> <span m='155000'>one of these two protons in a molecule,
  either this one or</span> <span m='161000'>this one. Those two protons are</span>
  <span m='165000'>equivalent. And what I am now going to draw</span> <span m='168000'>is
  a sequence of arrows representing the electronic flow</span> <span m='172000'>in
  the phenolphthalein molecule that occurs when H plus</span> <span m='177000'>is
  transferred over to the base with its lone pair of electrons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183000'>So, I am starting these arrows at pairs of electrons and I am</span>
  <span m='188000'>showing the flow of how they move.</span> </p><p><span m='191000'>And
  this is a pretty interesting rearrangement</span> <span m='195000'>because it is
  complicated. It is an electronic</span> <span m='199000'>rearrangement that is transmitted
  through this</span> <span m='203000'>molecule such that here in the center, this
  four coordinate or</span> <span m='208000'>sp three hybridized carbon, which is
  bonded to this</span> <span m='214000'>oxygen, has a pair of electrons that migrates
  to it.</span> </p><p><span m='220000'>And, if I draw now the product of this reaction,</span>
  <span m='225000'>what you should be able to see quite clearly --</span> <span m='239000'>And
  I am not always explicitly drawing out the lone pairs of</span> <span m='244000'>electrons
  on each of the electronegative oxygen atoms in</span> <span m='249000'>the molecule,
  but the sequence of double</span> <span m='252000'>bonds and single bonds in the
  molecule has been altered in a</span> <span m='257000'>profound manner because of
  the base coming along and removing a</span> <span m='263000'>proton from one of
  these peripheral oxygens,</span> <span m='266000'>namely, that one here. So, we
  have now a singly</span> <span m='272000'>negatively charged system. And that charge
  is balanced,</span> <span m='277000'>over here, by the base that has the proton
  attached to it.</span> </p><p><span m='283000'>That is the structure-function relationship
  that is typical of</span> <span m='289000'>indicator molecules. And indicator molecules
  can</span> <span m='294000'>either be naturally occurring, as they are in some plants.</span>
  </p><p><span m='301000'>Or, alternatively, they can be molecules that are</span>
  <span m='306000'>synthesized to respond to factors like pH in a given way</span>
  <span m='313000'>that might be desired. And, in the case of</span> <span m='318000'>phenolphthalein,
  this change takes place between</span> <span m='324000'>8.2 to 10.0 pH units. And
  the color change associated</span> <span m='330000'>with this is colorless to pink.</span>
  </p><p><span m='348000'>Looking at the structure of the anionic form of the</span>
  <span m='351000'>phenolphthalein molecule that results from its deprotonation,</span>
  <span m='355000'>what you can see is that this sp three hybridized</span> <span
  m='360000'>carbon atom at the center of the molecule, which in the neutral</span>
  <span m='364000'>form is acting as an insulator, preventing the pi-systems of</span>
  <span m='368000'>the three six-member rings from communicating,</span> <span m='372000'>is
  converted into a three-coordinate sp two</span> <span m='375000'>hybridized carbon
  atom here at the center, --</span> <span m='380000'>and provides a conduit for a
  communication between the</span> <span m='383000'>pi-systems of the three six-membered
  substituted benzene</span> <span m='387000'>rings that are in this molecule. And
  that change in electronic</span> <span m='392000'>structure is what leads to the
  production of this pink</span> <span m='396000'>Chromaphor in the anionic deprotonated
  form of a</span> <span m='400000'>phenolphthalein molecule that is important at
  high pH.</span> </p><p><span m='404000'>All you have to do, in fact, is to change
  the</span> <span m='408000'>substituents on this molecule in order to get a response
  at a</span> <span m='413000'>different pH value. Bromothymol blue is an</span> <span
  m='416000'>indicator with a structure similar to that of</span> <span m='420000'>phenolphthalein,
  but with a sulfur here in place</span> <span m='424000'>of this carbon. And in bromothymol
  blue,</span> <span m='428000'>we also have some isopropyl and bromine substituents
  on the</span> <span m='433000'>aromatic rings. And that modifies its</span> <span
  m='436000'>properties such that it goes from yellow to blue as the pH</span> <span
  m='441000'>rises above 6.0 to about a value of 7.6.</span> </p><p><span m='444000'>So,
  if you go to a textbook and look in a table of indicator</span> <span m='449000'>molecules,
  you will be able to select an indicator that is</span> <span m='454000'>appropriate
  for a particular type of titration.</span> </p><p><span m='459000'>And just to give
  you a very simple schematic of a classic</span> <span m='464000'>type of titration,
  I am going to show you here --</span> <span m='475000'>-- the type of system that
  you may need to think about in</span> <span m='481000'>connection with this next
  problem set.</span> </p><p><span m='486000'>And it is a system like this, where
  we have a flask down here</span> <span m='493000'>at the bottom that contains, initially,
  some volume of a</span> <span m='499000'>weak acid.</span> </p><p><span m='507000'>And
  that weak acid might be, for example,</span> <span m='510000'>acetic acid, as we
  talked about last time.</span> </p><p><span m='514000'>And we will say, for example,</span>
  <span m='516000'>that this could be 0.1 molar CH three COOH.</span> </p><p><span
  m='521000'>That is acetic acid. And the calculation that we</span> <span m='525000'>left
  off with at the end of last hour is one that we will get to</span> <span m='531000'>solving
  today that had to do with what is the pH of a tenth</span> <span m='536000'>molar
  acetic acid solution in water?</span> </p><p><span m='541000'>Or, in other words,
  what is the pH of this solution</span> <span m='544000'>down here containing the
  acetic acid at the beginning of this</span> <span m='549000'>titration that we are
  going to carry out.</span> </p><p><span m='552000'>We might have a weak acid down
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='554000'>We might also have our indicator present,</span>
  <span m='557000'>so that we will see a color change when we pass through a</span>
  <span m='562000'>particular pH. And we are going to make the pH</span> <span m='567000'>rise
  by putting into this burette here,</span> <span m='570000'>which will allow us to
  control a dropwise addition of a strong</span> <span m='576000'>base solution that
  we are going to add in and slowly neutralize</span> <span m='582000'>our acetic
  acid that is down here at the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m='587000'>So, this is
  strong base. And, for example,</span> <span m='591000'>that might be tenth molar
  sodium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span m='595000'>So, there is a typical titration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='600000'>And, if you think about it, because we are adding one</span>
  <span m='604000'>solution to another, we are going to have a</span> <span m='607000'>constantly
  changing volume in this bottom solution throughout</span> <span m='612000'>the experiment.
  And so ultimately what we are</span> <span m='616000'>going to be interested in,
  in our questions such as the</span> <span m='621000'>following, as the volume increases
  --</span> <span m='636000'>And we will give the volume, for the purposes of today's</span>
  <span m='639000'>lecture, the symbol the lower case letter m -- As the volume</span>
  <span m='642000'>increases, what happens to the pH?</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>We
  know that we are using a strong base to neutralize an</span> <span m='647000'>acid,
  so the pH is going to start out low and somehow is</span> <span m='651000'>going
  to rise. But what if we wanted to</span> <span m='653000'>predict the mathematical
  form of the rise in pH as a function of</span> <span m='656000'>this increasing
  volume of the solution?</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>Then we would have to have
  some equations that would be useful</span> <span m='664000'>for describing this
  physical property as a function of this</span> <span m='668000'>increasing volume.
  This is what we often want to</span> <span m='671000'>be able to do in chemistry.
  We want to be able to describe</span> <span m='675000'>properties that change either
  as a function of time or as a</span> <span m='678000'>function of some other variable,
  here volume,</span> <span m='681000'>in a titration. And we want to be able to see</span>
  <span m='684000'>if we can come up with a set of equations that would predict</span>
  <span m='688000'>that change as a function of this variable that is changing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='694000'>And, in order to do that, here, I am going to first point</span>
  <span m='698000'>out that we can put together some titration equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='716000'>And, ultimately, we are going to want to</span> <span m='719000'>generate
  a mathematical model for this titration.</span> </p><p><span m='725000'>And then,
  if you are experimentalist,</span> <span m='727000'>you want to go ahead and take
  that mathematical model and</span> <span m='732000'>compare it to actual experimental
  data.</span> </p><p><span m='735000'>But let's work on getting a model generated,</span>
  <span m='738000'>here. First we are going to have a</span> <span m='741000'>set
  of chemical equations. These correspond to the acid</span> <span m='747000'>HA,
  which is acetic acid in our example, in water reacting to</span> <span m='755000'>give
  some concentration of H three O plus plus the</span> <span m='763000'>anion A minus,
  which is acetate ion,</span> <span m='769000'>in this particular case. We have a
  strong base,</span> <span m='775000'>which is sodium hydroxide. And when you put
  sodium</span> <span m='781000'>hydroxide in water, because it is a strong base,</span>
  <span m='785000'>it ionizes completely. And I am signifying that with a</span> <span
  m='789000'>single forward arrow rather than with an equilibrium arrow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='793000'>This going into water is going to be Na plus and</span> <span m='798000'>hydroxide,
  OH minus. Now, at certain points in a</span> <span m='802000'>titration curve, you
  would not need to</span> <span m='805000'>necessarily go much further than this
  in order to have enough</span> <span m='810000'>information to start solving for
  the pH at a particular value of</span> <span m='814000'>a volume m. But at some
  points along that</span> <span m='820000'>titration curve, that is not enough information.</span>
  </p><p><span m='825000'>And that is because water itself can sometimes get into</span>
  <span m='830000'>the equation. Here is an interesting</span> <span m='834000'>equation,
  which is H two O plus H two O going to H three O plus</span> <span m='841000'>plus
  O minus.</span> </p><p><span m='847000'>That is a conceivable reaction that could
  be occurring even in</span> <span m='852000'>pure water, but the value of the equilibrium
  constant for that</span> <span m='857000'>reaction is very small. And I will draw
  that as an</span> <span m='861000'>equilibrium to distinguish it from the irreversible
  ionization</span> <span m='866000'>of sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='870000'>I have a pair of equilibria that I have written.</span>
  </p><p><span m='874000'>I have one forward reaction. And I want to point out,</span>
  <span m='878000'>too, that this third equation I have written here has a special</span>
  <span m='883000'>name, which is autoprotolysis.</span> </p><p><span m='892000'>I
  will tell you more about the equilibrium constant associated</span> <span m='895000'>with
  autoprotolysis in a moment. But because this equilibrium</span> <span m='899000'>constant
  is very small, meaning that there is very</span> <span m='902000'>little H three
  O plus and OH minus present in</span> <span m='906000'>pure water, because of that
  pure water itself is not a very good</span> <span m='910000'>electrolyte. Meaning
  pure water itself is</span> <span m='912000'>not a very good conductor of electricity,
  because the</span> <span m='915000'>autoprotolysis reaction lies mostly over here
  to the left in</span> <span m='919000'>pure water. But at certain points along a</span>
  <span m='923000'>titration curve, such as the one we are going to</span> <span m='926000'>want
  to develop on this panel here, we are going to need to</span> <span m='931000'>include
  autoprotolysis in order to get the right answer because</span> <span m='936000'>it
  is there, it can occur. Let's continue.</span> </p><p><span m='962000'>Another type
  of equation that we can use to put this into some</span> <span m='968000'>kind of
  a mathematical footing is the balance of charge in a</span> <span m='974000'>solution
  like the one that we are talking about in that beaker</span> <span m='980000'>to
  which we are adding sodium hydroxide solution.</span> </p><p><span m='985000'>And
  the charge balance consideration tells us that the</span> <span m='991000'>concentration
  of hydronium ion plus the concentration of sodium</span> <span m='997000'>ion must
  be equal to the concentration of hydroxide plus</span> <span m='1003000'>the concentration
  of acetate ion, A minus.</span> </p><p><span m='1010000'>Because what I have done
  here in the charge balance</span> <span m='1013000'>consideration is I have said
  okay, what are all the possible</span> <span m='1017000'>charged species in solution?
  I can make a list of them.</span> </p><p><span m='1021000'>It is those four things.
  And I know that the number of</span> <span m='1025000'>positive charges must equal
  the number of negative charges</span> <span m='1028000'>because this is overall
  a neutral beaker in which we are</span> <span m='1032000'>putting things. But everything
  that you put in</span> <span m='1035000'>is charge neutral, so the positives have
  to equal</span> <span m='1038000'>the negatives. That is a very nice limiting</span>
  <span m='1042000'>equation that helps us understand how the different</span> <span
  m='1047000'>competing chemical reactions and equilibria will all settle down</span>
  <span m='1053000'>and arrive at the physical result, which will be our</span> <span
  m='1059000'>observable. And then, in addition to that,</span> <span m='1063000'>we
  have a mass balance consideration.</span> </p><p><span m='1066000'>And in this mass
  balance consideration,</span> <span m='1070000'>we will be able to write that our
  HA initial value --</span> <span m='1077000'>-- that is square brackets, once again,
  denoting</span> <span m='1081000'>concentration -- will be, at any point in time,</span>
  <span m='1086000'>equal to the actual value of HA plus the concentration of A</span>
  <span m='1091000'>minus. And that just says that when</span> <span m='1095000'>you
  have acetic acid and you put it into water,</span> <span m='1100000'>it ionizes
  partly to hydronium ion and acetate ion.</span> </p><p><span m='1105000'>And that
  which does not ionize is unionized HA.</span> </p><p><span m='1111000'>And so, the
  ionized A minus concentration plus the</span> <span m='1116000'>unionized HA concentration
  is equal to the sum total of the</span> <span m='1123000'>acetic acid that is present
  in solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1127000'>And, similarly, we have another mass
  balance</span> <span m='1131000'>equation, which is just that the sodium hydroxide
  initial is</span> <span m='1137000'>equal to our sodium ion concentration because
  all of it</span> <span m='1143000'>is ionized. That is a little simpler than</span>
  <span m='1149000'>the situation with the acetic acid.</span> </p><p><span m='1153000'>And
  then, in addition to those equations, we have our</span> <span m='1160000'>equilibrium
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='1177000'>And we are going to have two of these
  because there are two</span> <span m='1182000'>equilibria that I wrote over there
  under titration equations.</span> </p><p><span m='1187000'>The first of these is
  going to have the equilibrium constant</span> <span m='1193000'>Ka, and that is
  going to be H three O plus times A</span> <span m='1198000'>minus, which is acetate
  in the case of</span> <span m='1202000'>acetic acid, all over HA. That is the expression
  for the</span> <span m='1209000'>equilibrium of acetic acid ionization in dilute
  aqueous</span> <span m='1214000'>solution. And I will give you a value for</span>
  <span m='1218000'>this in a moment. I won't write it right here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1223000'>Well, why don't I just do that. It is 1.8x10^-5 for this</span> <span
  m='1228000'>specific example of acetic acid. And then, if you were working</span>
  <span m='1235000'>with some other weak acid, you would be able to go to a</span>
  <span m='1239000'>table and look up the Ka value for it, if it has been measured</span>
  <span m='1244000'>and reported and tabulated. And then, we have Kw.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1248000'>And this is the equilibrium expression for the</span> <span m='1252000'>autoprotolysis
  reaction that I mentioned over there,</span> <span m='1256000'>the other equilibrium,
  which is H three O plus times</span> <span m='1260000'>OH minus. And that is equal
  to 1x10^-14,</span> <span m='1266000'>so a very small equilibrium constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1269000'>And some of you may be wondering why water is not</span>
  <span m='1273000'>appearing in an expression like this one or like this one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1277000'>And the reason for this is that in the expressions that
  I am</span> <span m='1282000'>deriving here, we are using concentrations in</span>
  <span m='1286000'>place of activities for these species.</span> </p><p><span m='1290000'>In
  the derivation of the equilibrium constants,</span> <span m='1295000'>the activity
  of pure water at very high concentration is</span> <span m='1300000'>approximated
  as one. And so, this is simplified as</span> <span m='1306000'>shown here. And having
  put all these</span> <span m='1310000'>equations together, what we are going to
  want to do</span> <span m='1315000'>is take the following approach. We are looking
  at the</span> <span m='1321000'>expression for electro-neutrality here,</span> <span
  m='1324000'>the equal number of positively and negatively charged species</span>
  <span m='1328000'>in solution. And I want to get this</span> <span m='1331000'>expression
  rewritten in terms of things that I know at any point</span> <span m='1335000'>along
  the titration curve, with the exception of the one</span> <span m='1340000'>thing
  that I want to know, the pH.</span> </p><p><span m='1342000'>And the pH we can calculate
  easily if we know the H three O</span> <span m='1346000'>plus concentration. So,
  I am going to be seeking to</span> <span m='1352000'>get Na plus, OH minus,</span>
  <span m='1355000'>and A minus rewritten in terms of H three O plus</span> <span
  m='1359000'>and constants using the equations that I have up</span> <span m='1364000'>here
  on the board.</span> </p><p><span m='1380000'>First, let's attempt to do that for
  A minus using this</span> <span m='1385000'>Ka expression. And I am going to rearrange
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1399000'>And it is going to be equal to Ka times HA divided
  by H three O</span> <span m='1407000'>plus. But I still have a problem with</span>
  <span m='1412000'>this expression for A minus because I am going to</span> <span
  m='1417000'>need to replace HA with something that will allow me to</span> <span
  m='1422000'>get everything in terms of just H three O plus and</span> <span m='1427000'>constants.
  And so, if I look over here at</span> <span m='1430000'>the mass balance equation,
  I can use this one and replace</span> <span m='1435000'>HA with HA initial minus
  A minus.</span> </p><p><span m='1484000'>Now I have A minus written in terms of
  an initial</span> <span m='1487000'>concentration of HA itself and constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1489000'>I need to rearrange this a little bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1492000'>I am going to multiply through by H three O plus so</span> <span m='1500000'>that
  I can write A minus times H three O plus is equal to Ka</span> <span m='1508000'>times
  HA initial minus Ka times A minus.</span> </p><p><span m='1516000'>And hopefully
  I have done that</span> <span m='1524000'>right. And, if so, I will be able to</span>
  <span m='1530000'>say that A minus is going to be equal to Ka times HA initial all</span>
  <span m='1539000'>over H three O plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1558000'>Does that
  look good? Plus Ka, thank you.</span> </p><p><span m='1563000'>H3O+ plus Ka.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1568000'>And let's bring that down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1585000'>Because
  now, I would like to go ahead and</span> <span m='1588000'>make this substitution
  for the charge.</span> </p><p><span m='1592000'>We have our A minus. The other ones
  are a little</span> <span m='1598000'>easier. We now have this equation H</span>
  <span m='1601000'>three O plus. And we were going to replace Na</span> <span m='1608000'>plus
  by NaOH initial.</span> </p><p><span m='1613000'>And we are going to recognize that
  we can use the equation for</span> <span m='1620000'>autoprotolysis to replace hydroxide
  with Kw divided by H</span> <span m='1626000'>three O plus. And then now we have
  the A</span> <span m='1634000'>minus being replaced by Ka HA initial all over H</span>
  <span m='1641000'>three O plus plus Ka.</span> </p><p><span m='1649000'>And at this
  point, you have actually done a really</span> <span m='1654000'>nice thing, because
  you have generated a general titration</span> <span m='1659000'>equation for the
  titration of interest in this particular</span> <span m='1665000'>case. You can
  see that at any point</span> <span m='1669000'>along that curve for a given volume
  m, we can now stop and</span> <span m='1674000'>walk along in one milliliter increments.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1680000'>And, in each spot along that curve, we could go ahead and</span>
  <span m='1683000'>solve this equation to get the value of H three O plus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1687000'>And then we would just have to</span> <span m='1689000'>take
  the negative log of that, and we would have the pH at</span> <span m='1693000'>that
  position. And we are interested if this</span> <span m='1696000'>type of a model
  for the mathematical form of the</span> <span m='1699000'>titration curve bears
  any resemblance to what one sees in</span> <span m='1703000'>reality. And, if so,
  one could then be,</span> <span m='1707000'>at least for the time being, until your
  theory no longer</span> <span m='1711000'>fits, satisfied that you have accounted
  for the various</span> <span m='1716000'>equilibria that could be present in a system
  such as the one we</span> <span m='1721000'>are describing here. This happens to
  be a cubic</span> <span m='1724000'>equation, and it has, therefore, three roots.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1728000'>And when we solve it at each of these points along the
  titration</span> <span m='1733000'>equation, because of the physically realistic
  quantities</span> <span m='1737000'>that we are going to be interested in,</span>
  <span m='1740000'>only one of the roots is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1745000'>We
  are talking about H three O plus concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='1749000'>It
  cannot be a negative concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='1751000'>The positive
  root is the one we want, and then we can convert</span> <span m='1755000'>that to
  pH and can see what kind of result we get.</span> </p><p><span m='1759000'>And so,
  I will show you how we can do that using a tool</span> <span m='1762000'>available
  on Athena.</span> </p><p><span m='1803000'>First of all, let me tell you that for
  the</span> <span m='1807000'>purposes of doing this, I am going to replace these</span>
  <span m='1813000'>various quantities by some simpler symbols,</span> <span m='1817000'>here.
  I am going to go x plus a,</span> <span m='1821000'>a is our NaOH initial, is equal
  to (b over x) plus (c</span> <span m='1827000'>times d) over (x plus d).</span>
  </p><p><span m='1835000'>So, I am going to use those simpler symbols for this</span>
  <span m='1838000'>equation. I could rearrange it and show</span> <span m='1840000'>you
  how it is a cubic equation, you set it equal to zero,</span> <span m='1843000'>and
  then you solve, and you get the roots.</span> </p><p><span m='1846000'>Just like
  a quadratic equation but with another term.</span> </p><p><span m='1849000'>And,
  instead of doing that, we are just going to leave it</span> <span m='1852000'>in
  this form, which is simpler to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='1854000'>And we are
  just going to use that.</span> </p><p><span m='1856000'>And so, let's go ahead and
  define A.</span> </p><p><span m='1860000'>That is the initial concentration of sodium</span>
  <span m='1863000'>hydroxide. We are going to go 0.1.</span> </p><p><span m='1866000'>And
  remember I need to get this in terms of the quantity m here,</span> <span m='1872000'>which
  is the volume. And so, I am going to take m,</span> <span m='1876000'>minus 20 over
  m. And the reason I am doing is</span> <span m='1880000'>this is I am saying that
  we have an 0.1 molar solution of sodium</span> <span m='1886000'>hydroxide that
  we are adding. But there is a dilution factor</span> <span m='1892000'>that you
  have to take care of. So, at every value m we are</span> <span m='1896000'>saying
  that we are starting with a volume of 20 in the acetic</span> <span m='1901000'>acid
  flask at the bottom there at the beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='1904000'>And
  then we are starting to add volume units of sodium</span> <span m='1908000'>hydroxide.
  And so the volume,</span> <span m='1910000'>m, is increasing. That is how I take
  care of</span> <span m='1913000'>that, there. And then our value of b is Kw,</span>
  <span m='1917000'>so that is 1 E minus 14.</span> </p><p><span m='1921000'>That
  is for autoprotolysis. And then we have c,</span> <span m='1925000'>that is our
  initial concentration of acetic acid.</span> </p><p><span m='1929000'>And we happen
  to have a dilution factor here,</span> <span m='1934000'>too, but it is simpler,
  just 20 divided by m.</span> </p><p><span m='1938000'>And there is that. And then
  d, what did I say that</span> <span m='1943000'>d was? d is our equilibrium constant</span>
  <span m='1946000'>for HA, 1.8 E minus 5.</span> </p><p><span m='1951000'>There is
  our acidity constant for acetic acids.</span> </p><p><span m='1955000'>Now I have
  the four things in there that I need,</span> <span m='1960000'>and those are four
  things that I know because of the initial</span> <span m='1966000'>conditions that
  I am defining for this problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1971000'>And then I am going
  to define my equation as being equal to x</span> <span m='1977000'>plus a is equal
  to (b over x) plus (c times d) all over (x</span> <span m='1983000'>plus d). There
  is my equation.</span> </p><p><span m='1987000'>And this nice calculator, all I
  have to do,</span> <span m='1991000'>in principle, is tell it what the value of
  m</span> <span m='1994000'>is. And then it is going to solve</span> <span m='1997000'>that
  cubic equation, give me back the three roots.</span> </p><p><span m='2001000'>I
  take the positive one and I take the negative log of it,</span> <span m='2005000'>and
  then I know the pH at that value of m.</span> </p><p><span m='2010000'>I can develop
  a whole titration curve based on the equations</span> <span m='2014000'>that we
  have been discussing. And so let's choose a value of</span> <span m='2018000'>m
  here to start with, and I am going to choose 30.</span> </p><p><span m='2021000'>We
  are starting at 20. At the very beginning of the</span> <span m='2025000'>titration,
  we are at 20. Let's see what happens at 30</span> <span m='2028000'>given the particular
  value of m. Here is what I do.</span> </p><p><span m='2032000'>There may be other
  ways to do this.</span> </p><p><span m='2034000'>I am defining this thing called
  the solution set.</span> </p><p><span m='2039000'>Because the solving of that equation
  is going to give us</span> <span m='2043000'>three values. And then I want to be
  able to</span> <span m='2047000'>pick the one that I want. We would use sol-set
  is equal</span> <span m='2052000'>to, we are going to solve that equation, and we
  want x,</span> <span m='2056000'>which is our H three O plus concentration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2061000'>And sometimes it chokes. Let's see what happens.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2065000'>Sometimes it is a little slow. But it takes a lot longer
  if</span> <span m='2071000'>you actually try to work it all out by hand.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2080000'>I have a picture of an image of this that I grabbed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2084000'>I can show you if this fails on me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2086000'>Don't fail on me. There we go.</span> </p><p><span m='2089000'>You can
  see it got the answer. And so here is a positive root,</span> <span m='2094000'>and
  then there are two negative roots to this cubic equation in</span> <span m='2099000'>x.
  And I want to find out the pH.</span> </p><p><span m='2103000'>When we are up to
  30 volume units, m equals 30.</span> </p><p><span m='2107000'>And so, I will define
  p here as equal to the negative log base</span> <span m='2113000'>10 of the first
  of the answers in my solution set,</span> <span m='2118000'>sol-set one, which is
  the positive x value.</span> </p><p><span m='2123000'>And, bingo, there is the pH,
  4.745 whatever dot,</span> <span m='2127000'>dot, dot. That is now the pH at a volume</span>
  <span m='2132000'>of 30. Now, you figure I am starting</span> <span m='2136000'>with
  20 volume units of 0.1 molar acetic acid.</span> </p><p><span m='2140000'>And by
  the time m equals 30 volume units,</span> <span m='2143000'>that means I have added
  ten volume units of strong base,</span> <span m='2149000'>enough to quench half
  of my acetic acid.</span> </p><p><span m='2152000'>And what if I had just only quenched
  none of it?</span> </p><p><span m='2157000'>I can change m now. Once you have this
  in here,</span> <span m='2162000'>you don't have to retype these things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2164000'>I can go back here and say let m be 20.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2167000'>And, if I do that, now I am actually at the zero</span> <span m='2171000'>point,
  before I add any strong base.</span> </p><p><span m='2173831'>And there is the pH
  now,</span> <span m='2176000'>The answer to the expression that we had at the very
  end of</span> <span m='2180000'>class last time that was going to tell us what is
  the pH of</span> <span m='2184000'>tenth molar acetic acid, there is the answer,</span>
  <span m='2188000'>2.87, because that is what we have when we start.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2193000'>Now you can see that you could just go through and use that to</span>
  <span m='2200000'>get the pH at any value of m along this titration curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2206000'>And when you do that, let's show you what the result</span>
  <span m='2212000'>is, now what you see here is a set of data.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2217000'>I start at 20. And I'm going up in single</span> <span m='2222000'>volume
  units, 21, 22, 23, and 24,</span> <span m='2224000'>I am showing what the pH is
  at each of those choices of m.</span> </p><p><span m='2229000'>And I have gone all
  the way from 20 to 60.</span> </p><p><span m='2233000'>And you take that data set
  --</span> <span m='2262000'>And then you can take a file, like the one I just showed
  you,</span> <span m='2271000'>which just had values of m and corresponding values
  of pH.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>And you can go ahead and just plot that thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2282000'>And, when you do that, you get the form of the</span> <span
  m='2285000'>titration curve here, which is the classic form of a</span> <span m='2289000'>titration
  curve for titrating a weak acid with a strong base.</span> </p><p><span m='2292000'>And
  you see that here, m was 20, and we let it</span> <span m='2295000'>increment through
  all the way up to 60.</span> </p><p><span m='2298000'>And what you see initially,
  and you are going to need to</span> <span m='2301000'>study this one and the other
  cases of titration curves that</span> <span m='2305000'>are in that chapter of your
  book, is how the little subtle</span> <span m='2309000'>features differ from one
  case to another.</span> </p><p><span m='2313000'>They do differ. A much simpler
  titration curve</span> <span m='2316000'>than this one is obtained if you titrate
  a strong acid with a</span> <span m='2320000'>strong base. This is titration of
  a weak</span> <span m='2323000'>acid with a strong base. And you see that initially,</span>
  <span m='2326000'>we have that 2.87 initial pH value, that it kind of shoots up</span>
  <span m='2330000'>quickly here at the beginning. There is a steep rise,</span> <span
  m='2334000'>initially. And then it kind of levels off.</span> </p><p><span m='2337000'>And
  in this region here, the pH is not changing very</span> <span m='2341000'>rapidly
  at all as you are adding more sodium hydroxide.</span> </p><p><span m='2346000'>Until
  you get out here, and the pH just shoots up.</span> </p><p><span m='2349000'>And
  you will notice that it is around where we get to 40.</span> </p><p><span m='2353000'>Because
  we started with 20 mLs of tenth molar acetic acid.</span> </p><p><span m='2358000'>And,
  when we get out to m equals 40, we have added 20 mLs</span> <span m='2362000'>of
  tenth molar sodium hydroxide. At that point the pH just</span> <span m='2366000'>shoots
  up. And then over here it turns</span> <span m='2369000'>over and just goes kind
  of slowly for a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='2373000'>And it just approaches an
  asymptotic limiting value over</span> <span m='2377000'>here on the high pH side
  of the scale.</span> </p><p><span m='2379000'>One thing you will notice here is
  that at this point where we</span> <span m='2384000'>have added the same number
  of equivalence of sodium hydroxide</span> <span m='2388000'>molecules as we had
  acetic acid molecules to start with,</span> <span m='2392000'>this occurs over here
  at greater than 8.0 pH units rather</span> <span m='2396000'>than at the neutral
  value of</span> <span m='2400000'>And I would like you to think about why that might
  be.</span> </p><p><span m='2403000'>And that will be something that will be covered
  in recitation,</span> <span m='2408000'>but it is important. If we had derived here
  today</span> <span m='2412000'>the expression for the titration of a strong acid
  with a strong</span> <span m='2416000'>base, then at 40 we would be right at 7.0,</span>
  <span m='2419000'>but when we were using this weak acid, acetic acid,</span> <span
  m='2423000'>it comes up here over 8.0 pH units.</span> </p><p><span m='2427000'>This
  point where we have added as many strong base molecules as</span> <span m='2431000'>we
  started with, weak acid molecules,</span> <span m='2433000'>is called the equivalence
  or the stoichiometric point in the</span> <span m='2438000'>titration. Moreover,
  where would your</span> <span m='2440000'>indicator molecule change color? At what
  point,</span> <span m='2443000'>at what value of m, for example?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2445000'>It would be close to there. It would be because,</span> <span m='2449000'>in
  the case of phenolphthalein, it changes between right in</span> <span m='2453000'>here.
  It might change right around</span> <span m='2455000'>maybe 41 or so. m equals 41
  might be where the</span> <span m='2460000'>color change from colorless to pink
  occurs, for the reasons</span> <span m='2464000'>that we have discussed. And then
  right here,</span> <span m='2467000'>it turns out at this value of m equals 30,
  the pH is equal to</span> <span m='2471000'>the pKa of acetic acid. And that is
  a relationship that</span> <span m='2474000'>I would like you to think about. And
  it is a relationship that</span> <span m='2479000'>comes into play very strongly
  when we talk about the</span> <span m='2482000'>preparation of buffer solutions
  according to the</span> <span m='2485000'>Henderson-Hasselbach equation. At m equals
  30,</span> <span m='2490000'>the pH value of the titration is the pKa of acetic
  acid,</span> <span m='2494000'>which is right here at about 4.7 or so.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2497000'>We did that one a moment ago. We found out what that value</span> <span
  m='2501000'>was. And, in plus or minus 1.0 pH</span> <span m='2503000'>units of
  that, we have the part of the</span> <span m='2506000'>titration curve that is called
  the buffering region.</span> </p><p><span m='2510000'>In here we have generated
  a buffer in situ.</span> </p><p><span m='2513000'>And buffers help the pH not to
  change too much when acids or</span> <span m='2517000'>bases are added in solution.
  That is what buffers do.</span> </p><p><span m='2522000'>They try to help you keep
  in a constant pH range because lots</span> <span m='2526000'>of things are dependent
  upon a particular pH for proper</span> <span m='2530000'>functioning. And you know
  that this is</span> <span m='2532000'>important in the world's oceans, it is important
  in our</span> <span m='2536000'>environment, and it is important in our bodies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2539000'>So, the pH considerations for aqueous solutions are quite</span>
  <span m='2543000'>important. And I hope that today I have</span> <span m='2546000'>been
  able to give you a nice way of thinking about some of the</span> <span m='2551000'>math
  that goes behind a titration curve.</span> </p><p><span m='2553691'>Have a nice
  Halloween.</span> </p>
