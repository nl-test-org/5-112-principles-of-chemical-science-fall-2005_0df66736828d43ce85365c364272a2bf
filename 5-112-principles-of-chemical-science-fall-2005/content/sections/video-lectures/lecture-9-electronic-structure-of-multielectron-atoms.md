  \ information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in\
  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>Last time, we saw\
  \ that these electron configurations that you</span> <span m='20000'>have been writing\
  \ down are nothing other than a shorthand</span> <span m='25000'>way of writing\
  \ down the wave functions for each electron in a</span> <span m='30000'>multi-electron\
  \ atom within the one-electron wave approximation,</span> <span m='36000'>where\
  \ we let every electron in the system, or in the atom have</span> <span m='42000'>its\
  \ own wave function. And, as an approximation,</span> <span m='47000'>we gave it\
  \ a hydrogen atom wave function.</span> <span m='51000'>But we also saw that at\
  \ most, we gave two electrons a</span> <span m='57000'>hydrogen atom wave function,\
  \ the same hydrogen atom wave</span> <span m='63000'>function. And, of course,</span>\
  \ <span m='66000'>you already know that the reason we did that is because of</span>\
  \ <span m='70000'>this quantum mechanical concept called spin, quantum mechanical</span>\
  \ <span m='75000'>phenomenon called spin. Spin is the intrinsic angular</span> <span\
  \ m='80000'>momentum. It is the angular momentum</span> <span m='83000'>built into\
  \ the particle. And that angular momentum comes</span> <span m='87000'>in sort of\
  \ two polarities, a spin up and a spin down,</span> <span m='91000'>-- -- corresponding\
  \ to the two</span> <span m='95000'>possible values of the spin quantum number,</span>\
  \ <span m='100000'>m sub s, that we looked at last time.</span> <span m='104000'>m\
  \ sub s can have the value plus one-half, or it can have the</span> <span m='111000'>value\
  \ minus one-half. We are about to talk,</span> <span m='115000'>now, about how spin\
  \ was actually discovered.</span> <span m='121000'>And it was discovered by these\
  \ two gentlemen here,</span> <span m='125000'>George Uhlenbeck and Sam Goudsmit.</span>\
  \ <span m='128000'>They were really very young scientists.</span> <span m='132000'>They\
  \ might have been post-docs at the time.</span> <span m='135000'>What they were\
  \ looking at was the emission spectra from sodium</span> <span m='141000'>atoms.\
  \ And this is 1925,</span> <span m='144000'>and so they already knew enough about\
  \ the electronic structure</span> <span m='151000'>to anticipate at what frequency\
  \ they ought to see emission from</span> <span m='158000'>the sodium atoms. And\
  \ so they got a discharge</span> <span m='163000'>going, looked at the emission,\
  \ disbursed it,</span> <span m='168000'>and they thought that they would see some\
  \ emission at this</span> <span m='174000'>particular frequency. But instead,</span>\
  \ <span m='179000'>what they saw was some emission a little bit lower in frequency</span>\
  \ <span m='184000'>than they expected and a little bit higher in energy than what</span>\
  \ <span m='190000'>they expected. In spectroscopy,</span> <span m='193000'>this\
  \ kind of emission, here, is called the doublet.</span> <span m='197000'>A little\
  \ lower and a little higher.</span> <span m='201000'>They looked at these results,\
  \ thought about it and said I</span> <span m='206000'>think we can understand those\
  \ two lines, those emissions at</span> <span m='211000'>the two frequencies there,\
  \ if the electron,</span> <span m='215000'>in particular that extra s electron in\
  \ the sodium,</span> <span m='220000'>existed in one of two spin states.</span>\
  \ <span m='225000'>This was a revolutionary idea. They were quite excited about</span>\
  \ <span m='230000'>it. They took the results of their</span> <span m='232000'>experiment\
  \ and their interpretation to the resident</span> <span m='237000'>established scientist\
  \ at the time that was closest to them,</span> <span m='242000'>this guy, Wolfgang\
  \ Pauli. Wolfgang Pauli was not a nice</span> <span m='247000'>man. They showed\
  \ him the data and</span> <span m='250000'>said, this makes sense if the electron\
  \ is in two different</span> <span m='256000'>spin states. And Wolfgang Pauli said</span>\
  \ <span m='259000'>rubbish. You publish that and you will</span> <span m='263000'>wreck\
  \ your young scientific careers.</span> <span m='268000'>Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit\
  \ let dejectedly.</span> <span m='271000'>No sooner than the door slammed shut,\
  \ Pauli sits down and writes</span> <span m='277000'>a paper on the presence of\
  \ the fourth quantum number,</span> <span m='282000'>m sub s. This is one of the\
  \ best</span> <span m='285000'>well-known travesties of science, now well-known.</span>\
  \ <span m='290000'>And it actually took, however, another three years</span> <span\
  \ m='294000'>and another gentleman, Dirac, who actually wrote down</span> <span\
  \ m='299000'>the relativistic Schr\xF6dinger equation and solved it.</span> <span\
  \ m='306000'>When you do that, out drops this fourth quantum</span> <span m='311000'>number,\
  \ m sub s. However, Pauli did contribute</span> <span m='316000'>to this problem\
  \ in the sense that he worked on the principles</span> <span m='323000'>behind these\
  \ problems with electrons being fermions,</span> <span m='328000'>etc., which we\
  \ won't go into. Out of that work came something</span> <span m='335000'>called\
  \ this, the Pauli Exclusion Principle.</span> <span m='339000'>And the essence of\
  \ that principle is that no two</span> <span m='343000'>electrons in the same atom\
  \ can have the same electron wave</span> <span m='348000'>function and the same\
  \ spin. Or, another way to say that,</span> <span m='353000'>no two electrons can\
  \ have the same set of four quantum</span> <span m='358000'>numbers. For example,</span>\
  \ <span m='360000'>in our electron configuration here of neon,</span> <span m='364000'>this\
  \ electron has the quantum numbers 1, 0,</span> <span m='367000'>0, plus one-half\
  \ for m sub s.</span> <span m='371000'>This electron has the quantum numbers 1,\
  \ 0,</span> <span m='374000'>0, minus one-half for m sub s.</span> <span m='378000'>These\
  \ two electrons don't have the same set of four quantum</span> <span m='382000'>numbers,\
  \ and that is why we could only put two electrons,</span> <span m='387000'>here,\
  \ in this 1s state. Likewise, this electron,</span> <span m='392000'>here, has the\
  \ quantum numbers 2, 1, minus 1,</span> <span m='396000'>plus one-half.</span> <span\
  \ m='399000'>This electron has the quantum numbers 2, 1,</span> <span m='402000'>minus\
  \ 1, minus one-half.</span> <span m='406000'>That is the Pauli Exclusion Principle,\
  \ which prevents us</span> <span m='411000'>from putting more than two electrons\
  \ in each one of these</span> <span m='416000'>states, 2s, 2s, 2px, 2pz, or 2py.</span>\
  \ <span m='426000'>Now, what I want to do is try to look at the wave functions</span>\
  \ <span m='431000'>and what they look like for the electrons in the multi-electron</span>\
  \ <span m='436000'>atom. And, to look at their shapes,</span> <span m='439000'>what\
  \ we are going to do is we're going to look at the</span> <span m='443000'>radial\
  \ probability distribution function.</span> <span m='448000'>Remember what the radial\
  \ probability distribution</span> <span m='453000'>function tells us? It tells us\
  \ the probability of</span> <span m='458000'>finding the electron between r and\
  \ r plus dr.</span> <span m='462000'>I plotted those radial probability distribution</span>\
  \ <span m='467000'>functions versus r for each one of the electrons in the</span>\
  \ <span m='473000'>different states for this multi-electron atom,</span> <span m='478000'>argon.\
  \ And what we want to do is we</span> <span m='482000'>want to compare and contrast\
  \ these wave functions for the</span> <span m='486000'>individual electrons in this\
  \ multi-electron atom to those of</span> <span m='490000'>hydrogen. Well, first\
  \ the similarities.</span> <span m='493000'>If you look at the radial probability\
  \ distribution for the</span> <span m='497000'>1s wave function here, what you see\
  \ is that the radial</span> <span m='501000'>probability distribution is zero at\
  \ r equals zero,</span> <span m='506000'>as all radial probability distributions.</span>\
  \ <span m='508000'>That is not a radial node. That probability distribution</span>\
  \ <span m='514000'>increases, goes to a maximum, and then decays exponentially</span>\
  \ <span m='518000'>with r. That is exactly what a 1s wave</span> <span m='521000'>function\
  \ looks like for a hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='523000'>If you look at the 2s\
  \ wave function, it starts at r equals</span> <span m='528000'>zero, it goes up\
  \ a bit and then goes to zero.</span> <span m='531000'>Here is a radial node in\
  \ the 2s wave function.</span> <span m='534000'>And then goes back up. Here is the\
  \ most probable value</span> <span m='538000'>of r and then decays exponentially.</span>\
  \ <span m='542000'>Again, it has the same structure as the 2s wave</span> <span\
  \ m='545000'>function in the hydrogen atom. The similarity is that all of</span>\
  \ <span m='549000'>these wave functions have the same kind of basic structure as</span>\
  \ <span m='553000'>that in a hydrogen atom. They have the same number of</span>\
  \ <span m='557000'>nodes, the same number of radial nodes and the same number of</span>\
  \ <span m='562000'>angular nodes. The difference between these</span> <span m='565000'>wave\
  \ functions and those of the hydrogen atom is that all of</span> <span m='569000'>these\
  \ wave functions are closer in to the nucleus.</span> <span m='574000'>For example,\
  \ if you looked here at what the</span> <span m='578000'>most probable value of\
  \ r is for that 1s electron in argon,</span> <span m='583000'>it is 0.1 a nought.</span>\
  \ <span m='587000'>What is the most probable value for r in the 1s state of</span>\
  \ <span m='593000'>hydrogen? a nought.</span> <span m='596000'>This is ten times\
  \ closer. This is much closer to the</span> <span m='602000'>nucleus than it is\
  \ in the hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='605000'>And if we went and compared the\
  \ most probable values for 2s,</span> <span m='611000'>2p for those of hydrogen\
  \ and 3s, 3p for those of hydrogen,</span> <span m='616000'>we would find that all\
  \ of these are much closer into the</span> <span m='621000'>nucleus. Why?</span>\
  \ <span m='622000'>Because the nucleus has a larger positive charge on it.</span>\
  \ <span m='628000'>The Coulomb interaction here is the charge on the electron times</span>\
  \ <span m='633000'>the charge on the nucleus. For argon, that charge is plus</span>\
  \ <span m='638000'>18 times e. That greater attractive</span> <span m='642000'>interaction\
  \ holds those electrons in closer to the</span> <span m='646000'>nucleus. That is\
  \ the bottom line.</span> <span m='649000'>That is how these differ. The structure\
  \ is the same,</span> <span m='653000'>node structure is the same, they are just\
  \ all closer into</span> <span m='658000'>the nucleus because of that greater attractive\
  \ interaction.</span> <span m='665000'>Now that I have this radial probability distribution</span>\
  \ <span m='668000'>function up here, I also want to use it to just</span> <span\
  \ m='672000'>illustrate a concept that I think you already know.</span> <span m='676000'>That\
  \ is this concept of a shell.</span> <span m='678000'>You know about the n equals\
  \ 1 shell, n equals 2 shell,</span> <span m='682000'>n equals 3 shell. And the word\
  \ shell also denotes</span> <span m='686000'>some kind of spatial information.</span>\
  \ <span m='690000'>I want to show you how the spatial information is depicted,</span>\
  \ <span m='695000'>here, on this graph. I want you to see that for the</span> <span\
  \ m='700000'>n equals 3 states, 3s and 3p, well,</span> <span m='703000'>the most\
  \ probable value is not exactly in the same place,</span> <span m='708000'>but it\
  \ is in the same place as when you compare it to the 2s</span> <span m='714000'>and\
  \ the 2p. You can see how well the n</span> <span m='717000'>equals 3 shell is separated\
  \ in space from the n equals 2 shell.</span> <span m='725000'>Again, the most probable\
  \ value for 2s and 2p are not exactly in</span> <span m='730000'>the same place.\
  \ We saw that 2p is actually a</span> <span m='734000'>little closer than to 2s,\
  \ but in terms of comparing it to</span> <span m='739000'>where the most probable\
  \ values are for 3s and 3p,</span> <span m='743000'>that is much closer in. And\
  \ so this graph,</span> <span m='747000'>here, gives you an idea of the spatial\
  \ information that is</span> <span m='752000'>denoted when we talk about shells.</span>\
  \ <span m='757000'>The n equals 3 shell is further out, the n equals 2 shell closer</span>\
  \ <span m='762000'>in, and the n equals 1 shell even closer in.</span> <span m='765000'>I\
  \ think that is a concept that you mostly know.</span> <span m='769000'>Here, you\
  \ see it on the radial probability distribution.</span> <span m='774000'>Now, we\
  \ have taken a quick look at those wave functions.</span> <span m='780000'>Now,\
  \ it is time to actually look at the energies of the</span> <span m='785000'>states.\
  \ We have not done that yet.</span> <span m='788000'>On the left here, I show an\
  \ energy level diagram</span> <span m='793000'>for the hydrogen atom. We saw this\
  \ before.</span> <span m='797000'>Here is the n equals 1 state. Here at n equals\
  \ 2,</span> <span m='802000'>we have four degenerate states. Here at n equals 3,</span>\
  \ <span m='807000'>we have 9 degenerate states. Here at n equals 4,</span> <span\
  \ m='811000'>we have 16 degenerate states. But the difference between the</span>\
  \ <span m='818000'>hydrogen atom and any other multi-electron atom,</span> <span\
  \ m='822000'>starting with helium, are two differences.</span> <span m='825000'>One\
  \ is that the energies of these states in the</span> <span m='829000'>multi-electron\
  \ atom are all lower than they are in the</span> <span m='833000'>hydrogen atom.\
  \ That is, the 1s state here is</span> <span m='837000'>lower in energy than the\
  \ 1s state in the hydrogen.</span> <span m='842000'>The 2s is lower than the 2s\
  \ state in hydrogen,</span> <span m='845000'>the 3s is lower, the 2p is lower,</span>\
  \ <span m='848000'>the 3p is lower, etc.</span> <span m='850000'>The energies of\
  \ those states are all lower.</span> <span m='853000'>Why? Because of the charge\
  \ on the</span> <span m='856000'>nucleus. That potential energy of</span> <span\
  \ m='858000'>interaction is greater because the charge on the nucleus is</span>\
  \ <span m='863000'>larger. That greater potential energy</span> <span m='866000'>of\
  \ interaction lowers the energy of the states.</span> <span m='872000'>It makes\
  \ those electrons more strongly bound.</span> <span m='875000'>Starting with helium,\
  \ all of these energies are lower</span> <span m='880000'>than those in the hydrogen\
  \ atom. That is the first difference.</span> <span m='885000'>The second difference\
  \ is, you can see,</span> <span m='889000'>now, that the 2s state is lower in energy\
  \ than the 2p state.</span> <span m='894000'>The degeneracy between 2s and 2p in\
  \ a hydrogen atom is lifted</span> <span m='899000'>or is broken, as we say.</span>\
  \ <span m='903000'>Likewise, the 3s state is lower in energy than the 3p state,</span>\
  \ <span m='908000'>than the 3d state. The degeneracy in those states</span> <span\
  \ m='912000'>is lifted, or it is broken. That is now what we have to</span> <span\
  \ m='917000'>talk about, why that is the case.</span> <span m='920000'>Why is 2s,\
  \ for example, lower in energy than 2p?</span> <span m='924000'>And the reason for\
  \ this has to do with the phenomenon called</span> <span m='930000'>shielding. We\
  \ have to talk about this</span> <span m='934000'>phenomenon, shielding, and we\
  \ have to talk about how</span> <span m='939000'>that leads to a concept called\
  \ effective charge.</span> <span m='943000'>But to do that, I am going to do the\
  \ following.</span> <span m='947000'>I am going to realize that each one of these\
  \ energies here,</span> <span m='953000'>E sub nl, so now these energies are</span>\
  \ <span m='957000'>labeled by both the principle quantum number and the angular</span>\
  \ <span m='962000'>momentum quantum number. I am going to realize that</span> <span\
  \ m='968000'>these energies here physically are minus the ionization energy</span>\
  \ <span m='973000'>because these energies are minus the energy it is going to</span>\
  \ <span m='977000'>require to rip the electron off from that particular state.</span>\
  \ <span m='982000'>And I am going to set those binding energies equal to a</span>\
  \ <span m='987000'>hydrogen atom like energy level here.</span> <span m='991000'>And\
  \ now I am going to use the board and explain that just a</span> <span m='994000'>little\
  \ bit more.</span> <span m='1012000'>I said these energies, which are now a function\
  \ of n</span> <span m='1017000'>and l, they are minus the ionization energy from\
  \ that nl</span> <span m='1023000'>state. And I am going to approximate</span> <span\
  \ m='1027000'>that as a hydrogen atom kind of an energy scheme.</span> <span m='1032000'>That\
  \ is, I am going to set this equal to R sub H,</span> <span m='1036000'>the Rydberg\
  \ constant over n squared.</span> <span m='1040000'>Out here, there is going to\
  \ be a Z,</span> <span m='1044000'>but this Z is going to be Z effective, Zeff.</span>\
  \ <span m='1050000'>And it is going to be squared, of course.</span> <span m='1054000'>And\
  \ that Z is going to depend on that particular nl state that</span> <span m='1061000'>you\
  \ are in. This Z effective,</span> <span m='1064000'>here, is the effective nuclear\
  \ charge.</span> <span m='1068000'>It is not the nuclear charge. It is the effective\
  \ nuclear</span> <span m='1075000'>charge. Why?</span> <span m='1076000'>Well, because\
  \ of shielding. Let's try to explain that.</span> <span m='1084000'>Let's take helium.\
  \ Z is equal to plus 2e.</span> <span m='1089000'>We have plus 2e here,</span> <span\
  \ m='1093000'>and let's do a thought experiment in that we are going</span> <span\
  \ m='1099000'>to take electron number two, here, and place it kind of</span> <span\
  \ m='1106000'>close to this plus 2 charged nucleus.</span> <span m='1112000'>And\
  \ then we are going to have electron number one way out</span> <span m='1118000'>here.\
  \ In this case,</span> <span m='1120000'>with electron number one way out here,\
  \ the nuclear charge</span> <span m='1127000'>that electron number one experiences,\
  \ because it is so</span> <span m='1133000'>far out, kind of looks like a plus one\
  \ charge.</span> <span m='1140000'>Because this electron, on the average,</span>\
  \ <span m='1143000'>is canceling one of the positive charges on the nucleus.</span>\
  \ <span m='1149000'>So, the effective charge here for this electron way out there,</span>\
  \ <span m='1155000'>we are going to say, is plus one.</span> <span m='1158000'>If\
  \ that is the case, well, then the binding</span> <span m='1164000'>energy of that\
  \ electron is one squared times R sub H over n</span> <span m='1170000'>squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='1175000'>We are going to consider n equal one because we are going</span>\
  \ <span m='1179000'>to talk about the ground state of the helium atom,</span> <span\
  \ m='1183000'>here. But you know what this value is</span> <span m='1185000'>going\
  \ to turn out to be. It is going to turn out to be</span> <span m='1189000'>minus\
  \ 2.180x10^-18 joules. That is the binding energy of</span> <span m='1194000'>an\
  \ electron in a hydrogen atom. This is a thought experiment,</span> <span m='1198000'>now.\
  \ This is helium,</span> <span m='1201000'>this is just one electron way out here,\
  \ and it cannot</span> <span m='1206000'>discriminate too well between the nucleus\
  \ and this electron,</span> <span m='1213000'>so the overall effective charge it\
  \ sees is plus one.</span> <span m='1218000'>But now, we take the other case.</span>\
  \ <span m='1221000'>The other extreme case is we are going to bring in electron</span>\
  \ <span m='1227000'>one really close to the nucleus. And electron two is way out</span>\
  \ <span m='1234000'>here such that it does not do anything as far as this electron</span>\
  \ <span m='1240000'>is concerned. And so this electron,</span> <span m='1243000'>in\
  \ this case, is experiencing the total</span> <span m='1247000'>nuclear charge on\
  \ the nucleus. And so we say in this thought</span> <span m='1252000'>case here,\
  \ with this electron really close,</span> <span m='1256000'>that the effective charge\
  \ is equal to plus 2e for this</span> <span m='1261000'>electron.</span> <span m='1265000'>Well,\
  \ if that is the case, we can calculate the binding</span> <span m='1271000'>energy\
  \ of this electron. And that is going to be 2</span> <span m='1277000'>squared R\
  \ sub H over one squared.</span> <span m='1280000'>We can plug in R sub H.</span>\
  \ <span m='1286000'>And we are going to get minus 8.72x10^-18 joules.</span> <span\
  \ m='1293000'>What this is is the binding energy of an electron in helium</span>\
  \ <span m='1298000'>plus. And so, in this extreme case,</span> <span m='1303000'>with\
  \ the electron really close, that is the binding energy.</span> <span m='1308000'>With\
  \ this extreme case, with the electron way far out,</span> <span m='1314000'>this\
  \ is the binding energy. This is total shielding.</span> <span m='1325000'>This\
  \ case is no shielding. The electron is much more</span> <span m='1331000'>strongly\
  \ bound. The reality is that the binding</span> <span m='1338000'>energy of an electron\
  \ in helium is somewhere in between.</span> <span m='1345000'>That is, the ionization\
  \ energy for helium, for an electron in</span> <span m='1353000'>now neutral helium\
  \ here, is 3.94x10^-18 joules.</span> <span m='1361000'>Somewhere in between this\
  \ extreme case of total shielding</span> <span m='1367000'>and this extreme case\
  \ of no shielding at all.</span> <span m='1372000'>And that is because, on the average,</span>\
  \ <span m='1376000'>there is another electron in between that electron and the</span>\
  \ <span m='1383000'>nucleus. And we can calculate the</span> <span m='1387000'>effective\
  \ charge, then, from the experimental</span> <span m='1391000'>binding energies\
  \ by just taking this expression and rearranging</span> <span m='1396000'>it. I\
  \ am going to solve that</span> <span m='1399000'>expression for the effective charge,\
  \ Zeff.</span> <span m='1402000'>And, when I do that that, add, of course,</span>\
  \ <span m='1406000'>this n squared times the ionization energy over the</span> <span\
  \ m='1411000'>Rydberg constant.</span> <span m='1416000'>n squared is going to be\
  \ one because we are talking about the</span> <span m='1422000'>ground state. The\
  \ ionization energy,</span> <span m='1426000'>I said, was 3.94x10^-18 joules. The\
  \ Rydberg constant is</span> <span m='1432000'>2.180x10^-18 joules. In the end,\
  \ I find an effective</span> <span m='1438000'>charge here of plus 1.34.</span>\
  \ <span m='1444000'>Again, why is that the case? Well, that is the case because</span>\
  \ <span m='1449000'>here is my electron, here is my helium nucleus and,</span> <span\
  \ m='1454000'>just on the average, between this electron and the</span> <span m='1459000'>nucleus\
  \ there is always another electron around.</span> <span m='1463000'>This electron\
  \ kind of partially shields this nuclear charge.</span> <span m='1470000'>It partially\
  \ shields it so that we calculated,</span> <span m='1475000'>from using this scheme\
  \ and using the experimental</span> <span m='1481000'>ionization energies, an effective\
  \ charge of 1.34.</span> <span m='1487000'>So now, we sort of understand shielding\
  \ and effective charge.</span> <span m='1494000'>That is a square root, thank you.</span>\
  \ <span m='1500000'>All right. Now, we have to use this idea</span> <span m='1504000'>of\
  \ effective charge and shielding to understand why the</span> <span m='1511000'>2s\
  \ state is lower in energy than the 2p state.</span> <span m='1516000'>And here\
  \ comes that.</span> <span m='1530000'>Let's think about the lithium atom.</span>\
  \ <span m='1533000'>The electron confirmation of lithium is 1s 2 2s 1.</span> <span\
  \ m='1539000'>The electron configuration of</span> <span m='1543000'>lithium is\
  \ not 1s 2 2p 1.</span> <span m='1547000'>Why? Because 2s is lower in energy</span>\
  \ <span m='1550000'>than 2p. But why is that the case?</span> <span m='1554000'>Well,\
  \ to look at that, we have to look at the radial</span> <span m='1559000'>probability\
  \ distribution functions for 2s and 2p.</span> <span m='1566000'>Here is a radial\
  \ probability distribution function for 2s.</span> <span m='1571000'>Here is the\
  \ radial probability distribution function for 2p.</span> <span m='1582000'>Now,\
  \ you have to do a thought experiment, here.</span> <span m='1586000'>In this 2s\
  \ radial probability distribution function,</span> <span m='1590000'>what you see\
  \ is that there is some finite probability of the</span> <span m='1596000'>electron\
  \ in the 2s state being really close to the nucleus.</span> <span m='1602000'>For\
  \ the sake of the argument, here, I am going to say that</span> <span m='1607000'>for\
  \ this part of the probability distribution function,</span> <span m='1613000'>the\
  \ effective charge Zeff is going to be plus 3e.</span> <span m='1618000'>I mean,\
  \ that is an exaggeration</span> <span m='1622000'>because obviously we have some\
  \ s electrons.</span> <span m='1625000'>But for the sake of this argument, I am\
  \ going to say the</span> <span m='1629000'>effective charge for this part of the\
  \ probability distribution</span> <span m='1634000'>function is plus 3e. For this\
  \ part of the</span> <span m='1637000'>probability distribution function for 2s\
  \ that is much</span> <span m='1641000'>further out. And I have those 1s electrons</span>\
  \ <span m='1644000'>closer in. So, for the sake of this</span> <span m='1647000'>argument,\
  \ I am going to say that these s electrons completely</span> <span m='1651000'>shield\
  \ the nuclear charge. And so, the effective charge</span> <span m='1657000'>for\
  \ this part of the distribution is plus 1e.</span> <span m='1662000'>Now, what about\
  \ 2p? Well, in the case of 2p,</span> <span m='1666000'>you can see that this 2p\
  \ wave function, although it is a</span> <span m='1671000'>little bit closer in,\
  \ for the most part it is about</span> <span m='1676000'>in the same place as the\
  \ second lobe here of the 2s wave</span> <span m='1682000'>function. We are going\
  \ to say that this</span> <span m='1686000'>effective charge is plus 1e,</span>\
  \ <span m='1689000'>just like this lobe of the 2s wave function.</span> <span m='1692000'>But\
  \ now, to get the kind of total effective charge,</span> <span m='1695000'>I am\
  \ going to have to take the effective charge and average it</span> <span m='1700000'>over\
  \ this probability distribution function.</span> <span m='1703000'>And so, since\
  \ in the 2s function I am going to average</span> <span m='1707000'>over a part\
  \ that has a plus 3 effective charge and a part that</span> <span m='1711000'>has\
  \ a plus 1 effective charge. Well, if I average over that,</span> <span m='1718000'>that\
  \ is going to be larger than the effective charge of this 2p</span> <span m='1724000'>wave\
  \ function because the 2p everywhere is plus one.</span> <span m='1729000'>The effective\
  \ charge here for the 2s is going to be greater,</span> <span m='1735000'>on the\
  \ average, than for the 2p.</span> <span m='1740000'>Because of this part of the\
  \ probability distribution</span> <span m='1744000'>function, this part that is\
  \ really close to the nucleus,</span> <span m='1749000'>where the electrons can\
  \ feel more of the nuclear charge or</span> <span m='1754000'>experience more of\
  \ the nuclear charge than they could if they</span> <span m='1759000'>were a 2p\
  \ electron. Therefore, since that 2s</span> <span m='1763000'>electron has a greater\
  \ effective charge, here,</span> <span m='1767000'>what that is going to mean is\
  \ that the binding energy of the</span> <span m='1773000'>2s state is going to be\
  \ lower in energy.</span> <span m='1778000'>It is going to be more negative than\
  \ the binding energy of the</span> <span m='1783000'>2p state. The same thing for\
  \ 3s and 3p.</span> <span m='1787000'>The same reasoning there. And it is all because\
  \ of this</span> <span m='1792000'>little part of the probability distribution function.</span>\
  \ <span m='1797000'>Now we can understand why the 2s is, in fact,</span> <span m='1801000'>lower\
  \ in energy than the 2p. Yeah?</span> <span m='1812000'>Because the 3s, although\
  \ it does,</span> <span m='1814000'>in fact, have this, it is a little bit further\
  \ out</span> <span m='1818000'>here, enough to make for this to compensate.</span>\
  \ <span m='1821000'>But, again, 3s is lower than 3p.</span> <span m='1824000'>We\
  \ are just going to compare 3s and 3p within the same shell.</span> <span m='1838000'>Yes,\
  \ it does have to do with the net area underneath.</span> <span m='1842000'>If the\
  \ probability was much higher, and it is not that much</span> <span m='1847000'>higher,\
  \ but if it were then you are right, it could cancel it</span> <span m='1852000'>out.</span>\
  \ <span m='1858000'>Now, therefore, we are ready to write the</span> <span m='1862000'>electron\
  \ configurations of all the atoms on the Periodic Table.</span> <span m='1869000'>And\
  \ you already know that we use the Aufbau Principle to do</span> <span m='1875000'>that.\
  \ Aufbau means building up.</span> <span m='1878000'>What do you do? You take all\
  \ the allowed states</span> <span m='1883000'>and order them according to their\
  \ energy.</span> <span m='1889000'>Most strongly bound or most negative energy goes\
  \ on the</span> <span m='1893000'>bottom, and next most negative energy, on and\
  \ on.</span> <span m='1897000'>And we will talk about a pneumonic for remembering\
  \ those</span> <span m='1901000'>energies in a moment. We use the Aufbau principle.</span>\
  \ <span m='1905000'>We start with the lowest energy state and we put an electron\
  \ in</span> <span m='1910000'>for hydrogen. There it is,</span> <span m='1912000'>the\
  \ 1s state. For helium, well,</span> <span m='1915000'>we also put that into the\
  \ 1s state.</span> <span m='1919000'>Except, as we fill these states, we have to\
  \ heed the</span> <span m='1924000'>Pauli Exclusion Principle. This electron,</span>\
  \ <span m='1928000'>here, goes in with the opposite spin.</span> <span m='1932000'>Next\
  \ lithium, 2s electron.</span> <span m='1935000'>For beryllium, another 2s electron,</span>\
  \ <span m='1939000'>opposite spin. And then for nitrogen,</span> <span m='1942000'>electron,\
  \ here, has to go into the 2p state.</span> <span m='1949000'>Now, it does not matter\
  \ whether you put it in 2px,</span> <span m='1953000'>2py or 2pz. They are all the\
  \ same energy.</span> <span m='1957000'>The next electron, carbon, what are we going\
  \ to do</span> <span m='1962000'>here? Well, here we have to obey</span> <span m='1964000'>something\
  \ called Hund's Rule. And Hund's Rule says that when</span> <span m='1970000'>electrons\
  \ are added to states of the same energy,</span> <span m='1975000'>and that is what\
  \ we are doing here in the 2p,</span> <span m='1979000'>a single electron enters\
  \ each state before a second electron</span> <span m='1984000'>enters any state.\
  \ And, those single electrons</span> <span m='1991000'>have to go in so that the\
  \ resulting spins are parallel.</span> <span m='1997000'>That is, they have the\
  \ same spin.</span> <span m='2000000'>Do we put in an electron like this?</span>\
  \ <span m='2004000'>No. Do we put it in like that?</span> <span m='2007000'>No.\
  \ Do we put it in like this?</span> <span m='2012000'>Yeah, according to Hund's\
  \ Rule. And then the next electron has</span> <span m='2017000'>to go into that\
  \ other empty p state before any of these states</span> <span m='2023000'>double\
  \ up. Then we keep doubling them up.</span> <span m='2026000'>The next electron\
  \ has to go into the next state 3s.</span> <span m='2031000'>Again, we double them\
  \ up. Now we are to the 3p state</span> <span m='2035000'>again. One electron goes\
  \ into 2px.</span> <span m='2040000'>The next electron will go into either 2py or\
  \ 2pz,</span> <span m='2044000'>according to Hund's Rule, and the spins remain parallel</span>\
  \ <span m='2049000'>to get the lowest energy configuration.</span> <span m='2052000'>And\
  \ then the next electron 2pz. And then we start doubling up.</span> <span m='2057000'>And\
  \ we keep going. You keep going in that way so</span> <span m='2061000'>that you\
  \ write the electron configuration of all the atoms</span> <span m='2066000'>in\
  \ the Periodic Table. Let's look at these electron</span> <span m='2072000'>configurations\
  \ kind of quickly here.</span> <span m='2076000'>Let's start with the third period,\
  \ the third row here,</span> <span m='2081000'>sodium going across here to argon.</span>\
  \ <span m='2085000'>Here is the electron configuration for sodium.</span> <span\
  \ m='2089000'>Notice here that I don't mind if you write that electron</span> <span\
  \ m='2095000'>configuration as 2p 6 instead of 2px,</span> <span m='2099000'>2py,\
  \ 2pz. Because you cannot tell the</span> <span m='2104000'>difference between x,\
  \ y, and z, anyway,</span> <span m='2106000'>if you are not in a magnetic field.</span>\
  \ <span m='2109000'>These electrons here in sodium that make up the inert gas</span>\
  \ <span m='2113000'>configuration of argon, of course, are the core</span> <span\
  \ m='2117000'>electrons. When we talk about core</span> <span m='2119000'>electrons,\
  \ we are talking about the electrons that make up the</span> <span m='2124000'>nearest\
  \ rare gas configuration. And then the valance electron,</span> <span m='2130000'>well,\
  \ is the electrons that are beyond the nearest but lowest</span> <span m='2135000'>inert\
  \ gas configurations. And also, when you are writing</span> <span m='2139000'>these\
  \ electron configurations, say, for sodium,</span> <span m='2143000'>you can write\
  \ it as the neon configuration and then just show</span> <span m='2148000'>the valence\
  \ electron, 3s 1.</span> <span m='2151000'>As we go across that third period here\
  \ everything is very</span> <span m='2156000'>normal. 3s fills up first and then\
  \ the</span> <span m='2161000'>3p's fill up. Now we get to the fourth</span> <span\
  \ m='2165000'>period, from potassium to krypton.</span> <span m='2169000'>Fourth\
  \ period, what happens here is that those</span> <span m='2174000'>first two electrons\
  \ go into the s states.</span> <span m='2179000'>They do not go into the 3d states.</span>\
  \ <span m='2183000'>They don't because those s states are lower in energy than</span>\
  \ <span m='2189000'>the 3d states. And so these electron</span> <span m='2194000'>configurations\
  \ are argon 4s 1,</span> <span m='2198000'>argon 4s 2 **[Ar]4s^2**. And then, once\
  \ we fill those 4s</span> <span m='2203000'>states, we start filling the 3d states.</span>\
  \ <span m='2206000'>Here is scandium, here is titanium,</span> <span m='2209000'>here\
  \ is vanadium, everything is normal,</span> <span m='2212000'>3d 1, 3d 2,</span>\
  \ <span m='2215000'>3d 3, and then we get to chromium.</span> <span m='2220000'>We\
  \ have an exception here, chromium.</span> <span m='2223000'>Chromium is not what\
  \ you would expect.</span> <span m='2227000'>It is not 4s 2 3d 4.</span> <span m='2231000'>Chromium\
  \ is 4s 1 3d 5.</span> <span m='2234000'>There is no way for you to know that a\
  \ priori,</span> <span m='2239000'>unless you do a very sophisticated calculation,</span>\
  \ <span m='2244000'>but this is experimentally observed that this is the</span>\
  \ <span m='2250000'>configuration. Why?</span> <span m='2253000'>Because it is lower\
  \ in total energy than this configuration.</span> <span m='2259000'>It turns out\
  \ that there is some extra stability in having a half</span> <span m='2265000'>filled\
  \ 4s shell and a half filled 3d sub-shell compared to</span> <span m='2271000'>having\
  \ a filled 4s shell and a less than half filled 3d shell.</span> <span m='2278000'>This\
  \ is an exception that you do have to know.</span> <span m='2283000'>But after chromium,\
  \ here, manganese behaves well.</span> <span m='2288000'>Iron behaves well. Cobalt\
  \ okay.</span> <span m='2292000'>Nickel okay. And now we get to copper,</span> <span\
  \ m='2296000'>and we have a problem. It is not what you would</span> <span m='2302000'>expect.\
  \ It is not 4s 2 3d 9.</span> <span m='2305000'>Instead, it is 4s 1 3d 10.</span>\
  \ <span m='2309000'>*Again, this configuration is</span> <span m='2315000'>something\
  \ you could not have predicted a priori.</span> <span m='2318000'>If you do a sophisticated\
  \ calculation you can see it,</span> <span m='2323000'>but this is also experimentally\
  \ observed.</span> <span m='2326000'>We know this to be the configuration.</span>\
  \ <span m='2329000'>This is not the configuration. This is the lower energy</span>\
  \ <span m='2333000'>configuration. Here is another exception that</span> <span m='2336000'>you\
  \ have to know, copper.</span> <span m='2340000'>And then after copper here, zinc,\
  \ things follow a pattern</span> <span m='2345000'>again. The next electron,</span>\
  \ <span m='2348000'>then, just fills up the 4s 2 3d</span> <span m='2353000'>Now,\
  \ at gallium, all of those are filled.</span> <span m='2357000'>We start filling\
  \ up the 4p states.</span> <span m='2360000'>Everything is fine until we get to\
  \ krypton.</span> <span m='2364000'>So, you have to know chromium and copper.</span>\
  \ <span m='2370000'>Now, the fifth row here, starting with rubidium,</span> <span\
  \ m='2374000'>strontium, ytterbium, zirconium, etc.</span> <span m='2377000'>all\
  \ the way across here. Starting with rubidium,</span> <span m='2382000'>again, the\
  \ electrons go into the 5s shell.</span> <span m='2385000'>They do not go into the\
  \ 4d. That is because with rubidium</span> <span m='2390000'>and strontium, 5s is\
  \ actually lower than 4d.</span> <span m='2394000'>And it is only once you fill\
  \ up the 5s states that you start</span> <span m='2400000'>filling up the 4d states\
  \ right here.</span> <span m='2405000'>Now, there are exceptions along this fifth\
  \ row.</span> <span m='2410000'>The two exceptions, molybdenum and silver,</span>\
  \ <span m='2414000'>are the same kind of exceptions as chromium and copper.</span>\
  \ <span m='2420000'>You have to know the exceptions for silver and copper and</span>\
  \ <span m='2426000'>molybdenum and chromium. The same identical kind of</span> <span\
  \ m='2432000'>exception as in the fourth row here.</span> <span m='2435000'>There\
  \ are other exceptions along this fifth row.</span> <span m='2440000'>You do not\
  \ have to know those. There is really no way,</span> <span m='2445000'>a priori,\
  \ for you to know that. Again, it is an experimental</span> <span m='2450000'>observation.\
  \ A sophisticated hard</span> <span m='2453000'>calculation will also show that.\
  \ And then, once you are done</span> <span m='2459000'>with cadmium, well, then\
  \ the 5p's start</span> <span m='2462000'>filling and everything is normal and you\
  \ get to the xenon inner</span> <span m='2467000'>gas configuration.</span> <span\
  \ m='2477000'>How do you remember what the ordering is of these states,</span> <span\
  \ m='2482000'>the energy ordering? Well, here is a pneumonic that</span> <span m='2486000'>maybe\
  \ some of you have seen before.</span> <span m='2490000'>Start out and write 1s,\
  \ then write 2s right below it</span> <span m='2495000'>and then 2p to the side\
  \ of it. And then write 3s,</span> <span m='2500000'>3p, 3d. And then write 4s,</span>\
  \ <span m='2503000'>4p, 4d, 4f. And then write 5s,</span> <span m='2506000'>5p,\
  \ 5d, 5f, and 6s, 6p, 6d, and 7s,</span> <span m='2510000'>7p. And now, to get the\
  \ energy</span> <span m='2513000'>ordering we are going to draw diagonals.</span>\
  \ <span m='2519000'>Well, first of all, the 1s is the lowest energy</span> <span\
  \ m='2522000'>state, and then the next highest energy state is the 2s state,</span>\
  \ <span m='2528000'>and then the next highest energy state is the 2p.</span> <span\
  \ m='2532000'>We are going to draw a diagonal.</span> <span m='2534000'>The next\
  \ state to fill is 2p. The next one is 3s.</span> <span m='2538000'>Now we are going\
  \ to draw a diagonal again.</span> <span m='2542000'>The next one to fill is 3p.\
  \ The next one to fill is 4s.</span> <span m='2546000'>Draw another diagonal. The\
  \ next one to fill is 3d,</span> <span m='2552000'>4p, 5s. 4d, 5p, 6s.</span> <span\
  \ m='2554000'>4f, 5d, 6p, 7s. 5s, 6d, 7p, and that is all</span> <span m='2558000'>that\
  \ is going to be important. That is one way to remember the</span> <span m='2565000'>relative\
  \ energy orderings here. And you do have to be able to</span> <span m='2571000'>write\
  \ this down on an exam. You will have a Periodic Table,</span> <span m='2577000'>but\
  \ it won't have the electron configurations on it.</span> <span m='2584000'>Now,\
  \ I am going to tell you something that sometimes people</span> <span m='2590000'>find\
  \ a little bit confusing. That is, the electron</span> <span m='2595000'>configuration\
  \ of ions. What I am about to say has no</span> <span m='2601000'>effect on what\
  \ I just said about how to write the electron</span> <span m='2608000'>configuration\
  \ for neutrals. This does not affect anything</span> <span m='2615000'>in your writing\
  \ down the electron configuration for</span> <span m='2620000'>neutrals. This is\
  \ for ions.</span> <span m='2623000'>The point I want to make is that if you actually\
  \ look at the</span> <span m='2629000'>energies of the individual 3d states and\
  \ 4s states across that</span> <span m='2636000'>fourth row, this is what they look\
  \ like.</span> <span m='2642000'>For example, at potassium,</span> <span m='2644000'>that\
  \ 4s state is lower in energy than the 3d state.</span> <span m='2648000'>That is\
  \ why we put the electron in the 4s state when we wrote</span> <span m='2654000'>the\
  \ neutral. The same thing for calcium.</span> <span m='2657000'>That is why we put\
  \ that electron into the 4s state and</span> <span m='2662000'>not the 3s state.\
  \ Lo and behold,</span> <span m='2665000'>right here at scandium, Z equals 21.</span>\
  \ <span m='2670000'>What happens is that the 3d state actually drops below in</span>\
  \ <span m='2674000'>energy than the 4s state. These are the energies of the</span>\
  \ <span m='2679000'>individual state now, and that continues all the way</span>\
  \ <span m='2684000'>across the Periodic Table. However, that does not affect</span>\
  \ <span m='2688000'>how you write the electron configuration of the neutrals.</span>\
  \ <span m='2693000'>For example, if you are writing the electron</span> <span m='2697000'>configuration\
  \ for titanium, here it is.</span> <span m='2702000'>It is the argon core, 4s 2\
  \ 3d 2.</span> <span m='2707000'>And, by the way, I don't care whether you write</span>\
  \ <span m='2712000'>3d 2 4s 2 or 4s 2 3d 2.</span> <span m='2717000'>You can write\
  \ them in either order.</span> <span m='2721000'>Now, you might say, well, why is\
  \ this the electron</span> <span m='2726000'>configuration if at this value for\
  \ Z, Z equals 22,</span> <span m='2731000'>titanium, the 3d state is lower than\
  \ the 4s state?</span> <span m='2738000'>Why don't these 4s electrons just hop into\
  \ the 3d states?</span> <span m='2743000'>Well, they don't do that because this\
  \ electron</span> <span m='2747000'>configuration actually minimizes the electron\
  \ repulsions.</span> <span m='2752000'>If these four electrons were in the 3d state,</span>\
  \ <span m='2756000'>well, then the repulsive interactions would be greater.</span>\
  \ <span m='2762000'>Because they are in the same state now.</span> <span m='2765000'>And,\
  \ therefore, the entire energy of the atom</span> <span m='2768000'>will be larger.\
  \ And it is the entire energy,</span> <span m='2772000'>the total energy of the\
  \ atom that is important when we look</span> <span m='2777000'>at the electron configurations.\
  \ In this particular case,</span> <span m='2782000'>if we look at the individual\
  \ d states and the 4s states,</span> <span m='2786000'>yeah, the d states are lower\
  \ in energy.</span> <span m='2791000'>But what is important is when we sum up all\
  \ of the energies of</span> <span m='2796000'>the interactions, what is lower?</span>\
  \ <span m='2798000'>What I am saying to you is that when we do that,</span> <span\
  \ m='2802000'>when we sum up all of the interaction energies,</span> <span m='2806000'>this\
  \ still is the lower energy configuration,</span> <span m='2810000'>even though\
  \ the 3d electrons at this value of Z,</span> <span m='2814000'>those 3d states\
  \ are lower in energy than the 4s states.</span> <span m='2820000'>That is why we\
  \ do not have this hoping over into the 3d states</span> <span m='2825000'>for the\
  \ neutral. Now, here comes the ion</span> <span m='2829000'>configuration. If you\
  \ have this configuration</span> <span m='2833000'>for the neutral, and now you\
  \ ionize titanium to</span> <span m='2838000'>make titanium plus, the electron configuration\
  \ is</span> <span m='2843000'>argon 3d 2. That is, it is the 4s electrons</span>\
  \ <span m='2848000'>that come off, that are plucked out.</span> <span m='2853000'>They\
  \ are plucked out because they are the higher energy</span> <span m='2857000'>electrons\
  \ now. This is the electron</span> <span m='2861127'>configuration for titanium\
  \ plus</span> <span m='2865000'>We are going to pull out those higher energy electrons,</span>\
  \ <span m='2870000'>which are the 4s electrons. Again, this affects only the</span>\
  \ <span m='2875000'>ion configuration. The same thing happens here on</span> <span\
  \ m='2879000'>the fifth row. The fifth row starting here</span> <span m='2884000'>with\
  \ rubidium and strontium, 5s is lower in energy than 4d.</span> <span m='2889000'>That\
  \ is why that rubidium electron went in the 5s state.</span> <span m='2894000'>The\
  \ same thing with the strontium electron,</span> <span m='2897000'>it went in the\
  \ 5s state. But right here at ytterbium,</span> <span m='2902000'>the 4d state goes\
  \ below in energy the 5s state.</span> <span m='2906000'>Again, that does not affect\
  \ how you write the electron</span> <span m='2910000'>configuration of a neutral.\
  \ For example,</span> <span m='2915000'>silver, which is way out here and is one\
  \ of those exceptions,</span> <span m='2922000'>if you ionize it, if you pluck off\
  \ an electron,</span> <span m='2927000'>which electron is going to go? 5s.</span>\
  \ <span m='2930000'>And so the silver plus one configuration is the</span> <span\
  \ m='2937000'>krypton core, 4d 10.</span> <span m='2942000'>It is that 5s electron\
  \ that is going to disappear.</span> <span m='2947000'>This is important. Do not\
  \ let it confuse you with</span> <span m='2953000'>the writing the electron configurations\
  \ of the neutrals.</span> <span m='2959276'>Okie-dokie. See you Friday.</span> </p>"
