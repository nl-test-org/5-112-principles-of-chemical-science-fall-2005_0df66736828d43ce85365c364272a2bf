  </p><p><span m='15000'>--fundamental frequency, here, nu.</span> </p><p><span m='18000'>Now,
  I should tell you that the model that we used to get these</span> <span m='25000'>vibrational
  energies for a molecule is actually called a</span> <span m='32000'>harmonic oscillator
  model.</span> </p><p><span m='44000'>It is a model. And it predicts that the</span>
  <span m='49000'>spacings between these energies are all equal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='55000'>The reality is, that the spacings are not all</span> <span m='61000'>equal.
  The reality is that this</span> <span m='65000'>molecule is an anharmonic oscillator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='68000'>And that although way down here in the well, the spacings
  are</span> <span m='73000'>just about equal, v equal zero,</span> <span m='76000'>v
  equal one, v equal two,</span> <span m='78000'>as you get further up in the well
  they do start to come</span> <span m='83000'>together. And they actually converge
  to</span> <span m='86000'>the dissociation limit. You don't have to know that,</span>
  <span m='92000'>right now. You will see that in later</span> <span m='94000'>courses,
  but I just wanted to make you aware of that,</span> <span m='98000'>that the harmonic
  oscillator model works pretty well down</span> <span m='103000'>here. But the harmonic
  oscillator</span> <span m='105000'>potential function actually looks like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108000'>A real potential function looks like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='112000'>This becomes anharmonic. So those spacings do get closer</span> <span
  m='116000'>together. That is for the future.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>Now,
  you can also put enough vibrational energy into the</span> <span m='124000'>molecule
  to break a bond. When you get up to here,</span> <span m='129000'>you can put enough
  vibrational energy.</span> </p><p><span m='132000'>And this hydrogen and the chlorine,
  as they oscillate out,</span> <span m='137000'>they will just keep going, If you
  put enough energy.</span> </p><p><span m='142000'>You get up here, and when they
  stretch,</span> <span m='145000'>they will just keep on their merry way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='150000'>They won't come back. There won't be a restoring</span>
  <span m='154000'>force. So, by putting a lot of</span> <span m='156000'>vibrational
  energy into the molecule, you can break your</span> <span m='161000'>bond. And in
  fact,</span> <span m='163000'>that is what happens when you break the bond.</span>
  </p><p><span m='167000'>You have a lot of vibrational energy in that bond,</span>
  <span m='171000'>and the two atoms just keep flying apart.</span> </p><p><span m='174000'>That
  was our diatomic molecule. What I now want to just talk</span> <span m='181000'>briefly
  about are polyatomic molecules because we said in a</span> <span m='186000'>polyatomic
  molecule, such as water,</span> <span m='189000'>we have several different vibrational
  modes.</span> </p><p><span m='193000'>And each of those vibrational modes actually
  has a different</span> <span m='198000'>fundamental frequency. And each of those
  vibrational</span> <span m='202000'>modes can be represented with this sort of interaction</span>
  <span m='207000'>potential. Sometimes it is not as simple a</span> <span m='211000'>coordinate
  system because you have some bends so you have to</span> <span m='216000'>plot this
  as a function of angles, which is not easy to</span> <span m='220000'>draw. But
  each one of the vibrational</span> <span m='223000'>modes in a polyatomic molecule
  can, in effect,</span> <span m='226000'>be represented by some kind of energy of
  interaction,</span> <span m='230000'>like we drew here for this diatomic molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='234000'>It is just a little bit more complicated because your</span>
  <span m='238000'>coordinate system is a little more complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='243000'>Particularly when you start talking about bends.</span> </p><p><span
  m='249000'>But let's take a look here on the side walls.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>What
  I am showing you is a vibrational spectrum of water.</span> </p><p><span m='262000'>And,
  again, this is some infrared radiation that is being</span> <span m='270000'>directed
  at a sample of water molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='277000'>And we are measuring
  the intensity of that radiation at a</span> <span m='281000'>photo detector as a
  function of the frequency of the radiation</span> <span m='287000'>going through
  our sample. And when the molecule absorbs</span> <span m='292000'>radiation at that
  frequency, that intensity at the detector</span> <span m='297000'>goes down. What
  you see,</span> <span m='300000'>here, is just a hypothetical spectrum for water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='304000'>You see that the molecule is absorbing some radiation,</span>
  <span m='310000'>here, at 1,595 wave numbers. Well, that 1,595 corresponds to</span>
  <span m='316000'>the fundamental frequency of vibration of this hydrogen</span>
  <span m='321000'>bending mode. That is 1,595.</span> </p><p><span m='325000'>That
  is the frequency in wavenumbers with which that</span> <span m='331000'>hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen
  bond is bending or vibrating.</span> </p><p><span m='337000'>This is also the energy
  between the v equal zero and v equal one</span> <span m='345000'>mode. This represents
  excitation from</span> <span m='350000'>v equal zero to v equal one. And then, way
  up here,</span> <span m='356000'>you see another transition at 3,652.</span> </p><p><span
  m='362000'>Well that, we know to be the symmetric stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='365000'>That
  is, both hydrogens moving in or out at the same time.</span> </p><p><span m='370000'>3,652
  wave numbers is the fundamental frequency for that</span> <span m='375000'>particular
  vibration. It also represents a transition</span> <span m='379000'>from v equal
  zero to v equal one.</span> </p><p><span m='382000'>And then, finally, at 3,756,
  that is the</span> <span m='385000'>anti-symmetric stretch, where one of the hydrogens
  is</span> <span m='389000'>moving out and one of the hydrogens is moving in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='395000'>Anti-symmetric stretch. It also is the v equal zero to</span>
  <span m='399000'>v equal one transition. And so, that is what you would</span> <span
  m='404000'>measure on an infrared spectrum of water.</span> </p><p><span m='408000'>Actually,
  infrared plus Raman, but we will leave that out.</span> </p><p><span m='413000'>And
  what is interesting is that any molecule that has an OH</span> <span m='418000'>stretch
  in it, or any molecule that has an OH</span> <span m='422000'>group in it -- If
  you take an infrared</span> <span m='426000'>spectrum of it, what you are going
  to see is</span> <span m='430000'>that it has a transition somewhere in between
  3,400 wave</span> <span m='434000'>numbers and about 3,800 wave numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='437000'>If you had an unknown compound and you put it into your</span>
  <span m='442000'>infrared spectrometer and saw a transition somewhere in between</span>
  <span m='447000'>3,400 and 3,800, immediately that is going to</span> <span m='450000'>clue
  you in that you have an OH stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='455000'>Because now other
  molecules that are at all common are going</span> <span m='460000'>to have a fundamental
  frequency in that range.</span> </p><p><span m='464000'>You can see how this infrared
  spectroscopy can be used as an</span> <span m='470000'>analytical tool to figure
  out what molecule you have.</span> </p><p><span m='474000'>And, of course, the actual
  frequencies,</span> <span m='478000'>then, are a fingerprint of the molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='483000'>But, just in general, if you did not know anything</span>
  <span m='487000'>about the molecule and you saw a stretch in this range,</span>
  <span m='492000'>you know you got an OH bond, there, that is undergoing a</span>
  <span m='496000'>symmetric or an anti-symmetric stretch if you have two OH</span>
  <span m='501000'>bonds. Likewise, say you had a</span> <span m='505000'>carbon-hydrogen
  bond, what you would find is that all</span> <span m='509000'>carbon-hydrogen bonds
  have fundamental frequencies from</span> <span m='514000'>about 2,800 wave numbers
  to 3,100 wave numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='518000'>If you see a transition in
  that range, you know that you have a</span> <span m='524000'>hydrogen bonded to
  a carbon. Because, again,</span> <span m='528000'>there really isn't anything else
  that is common that has a</span> <span m='533000'>vibrational frequency in that
  range.</span> </p><p><span m='538000'>When you get to a little lower frequencies,
  well,</span> <span m='541000'>then it is a little more difficult because there are
  lots</span> <span m='546000'>of different other modes that have vibrations,</span>
  <span m='549000'>which are a little bit lower frequency.</span> </p><p><span m='552000'>But,
  again, the specific number will identify the molecule for</span> <span m='557000'>you.
  One other thing is that just in</span> <span m='559000'>general, bending modes have
  lower frequencies than stretch</span> <span m='564000'>modes. That is a general
  statement</span> <span m='566000'>that is true. Also, generally symmetric</span>
  <span m='571000'>stretches have lower frequencies than anti-symmetric stretches.</span>
  </p><p><span m='577000'>That is true. And you will see more of this</span> <span
  m='581000'>infrared spectroscopy used as an analytical tool,</span> <span m='585000'>essentially,
  when you take some organic</span> <span m='589000'>chemistry. Well, what I want
  to talk about</span> <span m='593000'>now is the other internal degree of freedom
  in molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>That is molecular rotations. Well,
  molecular rotations are</span> <span m='606000'>quantized, just like molecular vibrations
  are.</span> </p><p><span m='611000'>Let me take my HCl again and draw this intermolecular</span>
  <span m='616000'>interaction potential. And let me put my v equal zero</span> <span
  m='622000'>level down here. Then, just for ease of my</span> <span m='626000'>diagram,
  I am going to put my v equal one level up here.</span> </p><p><span m='634000'>Rotational
  levels, they are quantized.</span> </p><p><span m='637000'>And the rotational quantum
  number is given the symbol J.</span> </p><p><span m='643000'>For example, if you
  have a molecule in the</span> <span m='647000'>first rotational state, that first
  rotational state,</span> <span m='653000'>then, will be right here. We will call
  that J equal one.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>And then, if you have it in the
  second excited rotational state,</span> <span m='666000'>that is going to be right
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='669000'>We will call it J equal two. And the third
  rotational state</span> <span m='674000'>is going to be right there. We will call
  it J equal three.</span> </p><p><span m='680000'>And the fourth, J equals four.</span>
  </p><p><span m='683000'>Now, if you have a molecule in the ground rotational state,</span>
  <span m='688000'>that ground rotational state, here, is J equal zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='695000'>And it is sitting here right on top of the v equal zero level</span>
  <span m='699000'>for the ground rotational state. The bottom line is,</span> <span
  m='703000'>you can have a molecule in the ground vibrational state and the</span>
  <span m='708000'>ground rotational state. If that is the case,</span> <span m='711000'>this
  is how much energy it has. When you are in the ground</span> <span m='716000'>rotational
  state, that is zero energy,</span> <span m='719000'>as we are going to see in a
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m='723000'>You can have a molecule in the ground vibrational
  state in the</span> <span m='727000'>first excited rotational state. If that is
  the case,</span> <span m='730000'>that is the energy. You can have a molecule in
  the</span> <span m='733000'>ground vibrational state and the second excited rotational
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='738000'>Then it has that energy. You can have a molecule
  in the</span> <span m='741000'>ground vibrational state in the third excited rotational
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='745000'>It has that energy. But you can also have
  a</span> <span m='749000'>molecule in the first excited vibrational state,</span>
  <span m='753000'>right here, and in the J equal zero state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='756000'>Well, if that is the case, it has that energy.</span> </p><p><span m='759000'>You
  could also have a molecule in the first excited vibrational</span> <span m='764000'>state
  and the first excited rotational state.</span> </p><p><span m='767000'>Well, then
  it has that energy. Or, a molecule in the first</span> <span m='772000'>excited
  vibrational state and the second rotational state.</span> </p><p><span m='776000'>Well,
  then it has that energy. Each one of these vibrational</span> <span m='782000'>states
  has, on top of it, a manifold of rotational</span> <span m='787000'>states. The
  rotations and vibrations,</span> <span m='791000'>for our purpose, are not coupled.</span>
  </p><p><span m='794000'>You can have so much in vibration, so much in rotation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='800000'>I want you to also notice, that the difference in energies</span>
  <span m='805000'>between rotational states is much smaller than the difference</span>
  <span m='811000'>in energies between vibrational states.</span> </p><p><span m='817000'>That
  is a general statement that is correct.</span> </p><p><span m='821000'>Now, we have
  a nice analytical expression, again,</span> <span m='826000'>for the allowed rotational
  energies of molecules,</span> <span m='832000'>and that analytical expression is
  the following.</span> </p><p><span m='837000'>E sub J is equal to h squared times
  J, J plus one over 8 pi</span> <span m='843000'>squared times I.</span> </p><p><span
  m='848000'>I is the moment of inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='853000'>I will explain
  that in just a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='857000'>What does this say? It says
  that when J is equal to</span> <span m='863000'>zero, the rotational energy, here,
  is equal to zero because</span> <span m='870000'>it makes this all go away. So,
  the molecule has no</span> <span m='876000'>rotational energy in J equal zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='879000'>When J is equal to one, we put in J equal one,</span> <span
  m='883000'>we calculate that, and it comes out to be h</span> <span m='887000'>squared
  over 4pi squared times the moment of inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='893000'>This
  is J equal one.</span> </p><p><span m='897000'>For J equal two, the molecule has
  3h squared</span> <span m='901000'>over 4pi squared amount of rotational energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='905000'>For J equal three,</span> <span m='911000'>it has 3h squared
  over 2 pi squared times the moment of</span> <span m='917000'>inertia.</span> </p><p><span
  m='920000'>The energies go up. Suppose I have a molecule in v</span> <span m='925000'>equal
  zero, J equal zero, and it makes the transition,</span> <span m='930000'>here, to
  J equal one, what is the energy difference</span> <span m='935000'>between those
  states? Well, J equal one minus energy</span> <span m='942000'>J equal zero. That
  is h squared over 4pi</span> <span m='946000'>squared times I minus zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='951000'>That is just h squared over 4pi squared I.</span> </p><p><span
  m='959000'>How do we make that transition? Well, to make this transition</span>
  <span m='963000'>right here, we are going to need a photon, and that photon is</span>
  <span m='968000'>going to have to have an energy exactly equal to this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='973000'>Our photon E equal h nu, that has got to be equal to h</span> <span m='977000'>squared
  4pi squared times I.</span> </p><p><span m='982000'>I can solve for the frequency
  of the photon that I need to</span> <span m='987000'>make that transition. The frequency
  of that photon</span> <span m='993000'>then is h over 4pi squared times I.</span>
  </p><p><span m='996000'>That is the frequency of the photon that</span> <span m='1003000'>I
  need. Now, in the case of HCl,</span> <span m='1007000'>we said that HCl has two
  rotational modes.</span> </p><p><span m='1011000'>It has a mode rotation around
  this axis, and it also has a</span> <span m='1018000'>mode rotation around this
  axis, in the plane of the board.</span> </p><p><span m='1026000'>These two rotations
  are degenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='1029000'>If you put in a photon with this
  frequency,</span> <span m='1034000'>here, it will excite either this rotation or
  that rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='1041000'>Now, let's look on the side wall
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1045000'>How do we do the experiment? Again, just like
  we do it in</span> <span m='1052000'>the infrared, except that the energy of the</span>
  <span m='1055000'>photon we now need is in the microwave range.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1059000'>Microwave spectra measure rotational spectra of molecules.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1063000'>And so, again we have a microwave radiation,</span> <span m='1067000'>monochromator,
  coming out, going through the</span> <span m='1071000'>sample, photo detector, look
  at the intensity of the</span> <span m='1075000'>photo detector as a function of
  the frequency.</span> </p><p><span m='1080000'>At some frequency here, you see a
  dip in that</span> <span m='1084000'>intensity. Well, that is where the</span> <span
  m='1087000'>molecule absorbs. And, in the case of HCl here,</span> <span m='1092000'>the
  frequency of that absorption for J equal zero to J</span> <span m='1097000'>equal
  one, well, that frequency occurs at</span> <span m='1101000'>6.3x10^11 hertz. That
  would be the frequency of</span> <span m='1106000'>the photon that you would need
  for absorption.</span> </p><p><span m='1112000'>Yes? I'm sorry?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1113000'>We got into the microwave range, here, because the</span> <span m='1117000'>spacings
  between the rotational states are much lower than the</span> <span m='1123000'>spacings
  between the vibrational states.</span> </p><p><span m='1126000'>And I just actually
  wanted to make that point,</span> <span m='1130000'>here. We can calculate in terms
  of</span> <span m='1133000'>the energy, here, what this spacing is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1137000'>Let's do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1145000'>If we want to know the
  change in energy from J equal zero to J</span> <span m='1151000'>equal one, that
  change in energy is just h times the frequency of</span> <span m='1159000'>the photon,
  that photon, there, that makes that</span> <span m='1164000'>transition happen.
  You can plug that in,</span> <span m='1170000'>there, so we have 6.6261x10^-34 joule
  seconds,</span> <span m='1177000'>times the frequency 6.3479x10^11 hertz.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1183000'>When you do that, you should get 4.2062x10^-22</span> <span
  m='1190000'>joules. Or, if I convert that to</span> <span m='1195000'>kilojoules
  per mole, it is 6.25330 kilojoules per</span> <span m='1203000'>mole. In general,
  the difference in</span> <span m='1208000'>the spacings here, the energy difference
  for</span> <span m='1212000'>vibration, we said is something between three to 40
  kilojoules</span> <span m='1218000'>per mole. That is the difference between</span>
  <span m='1222000'>v equal zero and v equal one, generally, for a large range of</span>
  <span m='1228000'>molecules. The difference in the</span> <span m='1232000'>frequencies
  here for rotation, delta E, that is more like</span> <span m='1240000'>something
  on the order of 0.01 to about 1.0 kilojoules per</span> <span m='1247000'>mole.
  That is what is typical.</span> </p><p><span m='1251000'>So, rotations are much
  more closely spaced in energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1258000'>Yes? Well, in the
  case of the</span> <span m='1262000'>rotational spectra, there is a little bit more</span>
  <span m='1266000'>diversity in what units are used.</span> </p><p><span m='1269000'>And
  the reason is this. They are more closely spaced.</span> </p><p><span m='1273000'>And
  the whole wavenumber came into use in vibrational</span> <span m='1278000'>spectroscopy
  when the way people would analyze the spectra would</span> <span m='1283000'>be
  to take a photographic plate with the light coming in.</span> </p><p><span m='1290000'>And
  you would see the lines separated in space.</span> </p><p><span m='1293000'>And
  people would take a ruler in centimeters to measure the</span> <span m='1298000'>spacings
  between the lines. That is historically how the</span> <span m='1303000'>wavenumber
  unit came to be. The problem is that does not</span> <span m='1308000'>work so well
  in rotational spectroscopy,</span> <span m='1311000'>often, because the spacings
  are much closer together.</span> </p><p><span m='1316000'>And so, depending exactly
  on what kind of diffraction grading</span> <span m='1321000'>used, the wavenumbers
  are not always used.</span> </p><p><span m='1326000'>Sometimes they are the frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1328000'>We go back and forth. And, in your homework problems,</span>
  <span m='1333000'>I go back and forth, too.</span> </p><p><span m='1335000'>You
  really have to deal with both kinds of units.</span> </p><p><span m='1339000'>But
  now, one of the usefulnesses of this rotational</span> <span m='1343000'>spectroscopy
  in getting, say, this frequency for the</span> <span m='1348000'>transition, one
  of the usefulnesses,</span> <span m='1351000'>there, is to calculate the bond length
  of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1357000'>To determine the bond length of
  the molecule really very</span> <span m='1362000'>accurately. Because what we said
  over here</span> <span m='1366000'>is that the frequency for that transition is
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='1371000'>The frequency of that transition is h over
  4pi squared</span> <span m='1377000'>times I. And I is a moment of inertia.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1382000'>The moment of inertia is the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1385000'>Maybe you have had this 8.01. No, not yet?</span> </p><p><span m='1389000'>Oh,
  you will. The moment of inertia is the</span> <span m='1393000'>reduced mass times
  the distance between the two masses.</span> </p><p><span m='1399000'>In our case,
  for the HCl molecule,</span> <span m='1402000'>it is equilibrium bond length, r
  sub e squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1408000'>The reduced mass is what I gave you
  before, m1 m2 over the sum</span> <span m='1413000'>of the two masses.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1416000'>Again, it is a way to reduce a two-body problem to a one-body</span>
  <span m='1421000'>problem, where the one-body is this fictitious body of reduced</span>
  <span m='1426000'>mass. But it is exact.</span> </p><p><span m='1428000'>There are
  no approximations. This is correct.</span> </p><p><span m='1431000'>That is the
  moment of inertia of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1435000'>It is a property
  of the molecule, depending on the mass</span> <span m='1440000'>and the bond length.
  You can see that if I</span> <span m='1445000'>substitute that in there, h over
  4pi squared times nu r</span> <span m='1450000'>sub e squared, and then I go and</span>
  <span m='1455000'>solve for r sub e, well, r sub e is (h over 4pi</span> <span m='1460000'>squared
  mu times nu) to the one-half.</span> </p><p><span m='1463000'>In the case of HCl</span>
  <span m='1468000'>-- Actually, I think this is all</span> <span m='1472000'>in my
  slide, here. If I go and stick in the value</span> <span m='1477000'>for nu, the
  equilibrium bond length, here,</span> <span m='1482000'>is really 1.2748x10^-10
  meters. We can really measure these</span> <span m='1488000'>frequencies with high
  precision and high accuracy.</span> </p><p><span m='1493000'>All bond lengths, really,
  come from measurements,</span> <span m='1498000'>now, of rotational spectra. All
  bond lengths in the gas</span> <span m='1505000'>phase, wherever we can measure
  the rotational spectra of the</span> <span m='1512000'>molecule. That is one of
  the main uses</span> <span m='1516000'>for rotational spectroscopy. Questions?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1520000'>If not, what I am going to do is leave the subject of internal</span>
  <span m='1528000'>motion. I want to talk for the rest of</span> <span m='1532000'>the
  hour, and a little bit on Friday about another topic,</span> <span m='1538000'>which
  is intermolecular attraction.</span> </p><p><span m='1547000'>Interactions. Or,
  I am going to write it here</span> <span m='1551000'>as attractions. The bottom
  line is,</span> <span m='1554000'>I want to try to understand, on a microscopic
  scale,</span> <span m='1558000'>deviations from the inner gas law, PV equal nRT.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1572000'>You know PV equal nRT, that if I made a plot of the</span>
  <span m='1577000'>volume versus the temperature and kept the pressure constant,</span>
  <span m='1583000'>say the pressure is at one atmosphere, and the number of</span>
  <span m='1588000'>moles in my gas is constant, well, you know that what I</span>
  <span m='1594000'>should see from that equation is a straight line.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1600000'>But suppose I took a balloon filled with air and started to</span> <span
  m='1605000'>cool down that balloon--in that case, the atmospheric pressure</span>
  <span m='1611000'>is essentially constant--in that case, what would happen is that</span>
  <span m='1617000'>the volume would decrease. It would decrease in a linear</span>
  <span m='1622000'>manner with temperature; everything would be fine until</span>
  <span m='1626000'>at some low temperature, this volume would start to</span> <span
  m='1631000'>deviate from the straight line dependence, start to go down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1636000'>And then, all of a sudden, the volume would go very low</span>
  <span m='1640000'>because, of course, at roughly 77 degrees Kelvin,</span> <span
  m='1644000'>which is the boiling point of nitrogen, the liquid would</span> <span
  m='1649000'>condense. So, the volume gets very small.</span> </p><p><span m='1654000'>I
  could also do that with helium.</span> </p><p><span m='1657000'>If I took a helium
  balloon and cooled it down,</span> <span m='1661000'>the volume would decrease.
  But then, as I got pretty cold,</span> <span m='1666000'>the volume would start
  to decrease faster than predicted</span> <span m='1672000'>by the inert gas law.
  And right at 4 degrees Kelvin,</span> <span m='1677000'>the boiling point of liquid
  helium, the volume would then</span> <span m='1682000'>just kind of plummet. And
  so you can understand what</span> <span m='1689000'>happens right here, but we also
  want to understand,</span> <span m='1694000'>why does the PV equal nRT start to
  deviate before we get to a</span> <span m='1700000'>boiling point of the liquid?
  The reason is because of these</span> <span m='1706000'>intermolecular attractions.
  For example,</span> <span m='1711000'>if I had in my gas this nitrogen molecule
  headed toward</span> <span m='1715000'>the wall of my container, and it has some
  initial</span> <span m='1720000'>straight trajectory, it is going to hit the wall,</span>
  <span m='1724000'>where it is going to exert this force, which will lead to my</span>
  <span m='1729000'>macroscopic pressure. But, if there is an oxygen</span> <span
  m='1733000'>molecule around, that nitrogen molecule could</span> <span m='1737000'>indeed
  be deflected by these attractive interactions,</span> <span m='1742000'>circle around
  it, and then finally hit the wall.</span> </p><p><span m='1748000'>So the nitrogen
  would be delayed in hitting the wall.</span> </p><p><span m='1752000'>If it is delayed,
  then my force is going to be</span> <span m='1756000'>not as great, because it is
  momentum change</span> <span m='1759000'>over the change in time between collisions,
  my pressure is going</span> <span m='1765000'>to be lower if, in fact, this nitrogen</span>
  <span m='1768000'>experiences some attractive interaction that delays it from</span>
  <span m='1773000'>hitting the wall. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1777000'>the
  pressure is lower, or vice versa.</span> </p><p><span m='1780000'>In this case,
  if I kept the outside pressure</span> <span m='1785000'>constant, then the volume
  would go down.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>Now, why is that the case? Why should
  nitrogen and oxygen</span> <span m='1794000'>actually attract each other? In order
  to talk about that,</span> <span m='1800000'>we have to think a little bit more
  carefully about what the</span> <span m='1805000'>electron distributions are around
  nitrogen molecules,</span> <span m='1810000'>oxygen molecules. We treated, in the
  sodium</span> <span m='1813000'>chloride, lithium chloride, those things as point
  charges.</span> </p><p><span m='1819000'>We have to be a little more sophisticated
  now in thinking</span> <span m='1824000'>about what the electron distributions are
  in these kinds</span> <span m='1828000'>of molecules, nitrogen or oxygen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1833000'>And let me, for the ease of just drawing this,</span> <span
  m='1837000'>talk about the inert gas, here, argon.</span> </p><p><span m='1840000'>As
  you may or may not know, on the average,</span> <span m='1844000'>the electron distribution
  around argon is spherical.</span> </p><p><span m='1848000'>But, although quantum
  mechanics does not allow us to see this,</span> <span m='1854000'>this electron
  distribution does fluctuate.</span> </p><p><span m='1859000'>And, at some momentary
  time, it could be that the electron</span> <span m='1863000'>distribution here is
  a little bit larger on one side of this</span> <span m='1868000'>argon. And then
  the argon nucleus here</span> <span m='1872000'>is a little bit deshielded, so we
  kind of have a charge</span> <span m='1876000'>shift here, positive here, minus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1879000'>When we do that, this is a dipole.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1882000'>We have separated charge in space.</span> </p><p><span m='1885000'>That
  is what a definition of a dipole is.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>And then, of
  course, if there is another argon atom</span> <span m='1895000'>around, well, this
  dipole then is going to</span> <span m='1900000'>induce the charge distribution
  around another argon,</span> <span m='1906000'>so that now, the positive end is
  going to</span> <span m='1911000'>attract or distort the electron distribution around
  argon in</span> <span m='1917000'>this way. And this will be the positive</span>
  <span m='1922000'>end. And so, we have an</span> <span m='1924000'>instantaneous
  dipole which has induced a dipole,</span> <span m='1929000'>an instantaneous dipole,
  in a neighboring argon atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1934000'>Now we have these two
  dipoles together, and they are oriented</span> <span m='1940000'>in opposite directions.
  And that is an attractive</span> <span m='1944000'>interaction. The next result
  is an</span> <span m='1947000'>attraction. And, of course,</span> <span m='1952000'>we
  call that an induced dipole-induced dipole</span> <span m='1958000'>interaction.
  We also call that,</span> <span m='1962000'>sometimes, the London dispersion force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1975000'>This is not a permanent dipole. This is a momentary dipole.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1982000'>This is an instantaneous dipole, which induces,</span>
  <span m='1986000'>then, an instantaneous dipole in the neighboring molecule or</span>
  <span m='1991000'>the atom. The result is,</span> <span m='1993000'>because you
  have these two dipoles now, align in opposite</span> <span m='1998000'>directions,
  a lowering of the energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2002000'>There is a net attraction.
  That is a reason why,</span> <span m='2006000'>in this nitrogen and oxygen, there
  might be some attraction.</span> </p><p><span m='2013000'>The nitrogen may, in fact,
  be deflected from its</span> <span m='2017000'>trajectory and hang around the oxygen
  a little longer before it</span> <span m='2022000'>hits the wall. Therefore, the
  pressure is</span> <span m='2026000'>lower than you would expect, or the volume
  is lower than you</span> <span m='2031000'>would expect, if you were keeping the</span>
  <span m='2034000'>pressure constant. And we can draw that</span> <span m='2037000'>interaction
  energy for two argons.</span> </p><p><span m='2042000'>Here are two argons separated.
  Argon limit,</span> <span m='2046000'>we draw the energy of interaction, there is
  some net</span> <span m='2052000'>attraction. This is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2055000'>And that net attraction, here, as they come closer and</span> <span
  m='2060000'>closer together, is a whopping 0.996 kilojoules</span> <span m='2066000'>per
  mole. Not very large.</span> </p><p><span m='2070000'>But there is a net attraction.
  You can also see that there is</span> <span m='2076000'>a value of r at which that
  attraction is the maximum.</span> </p><p><span m='2081000'>And that is the equilibrium
  bond length of the molecule</span> <span m='2086000'>argon two. Can you form a molecule
  between</span> <span m='2091000'>inert gases? You sure can.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2094000'>And sometimes we call this a van der Waal's dimer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2100000'>You can make these molecules. There is the bond length.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2106000'>In the case of argon, that bond length is 3.8</span> <span m='2111000'>angstroms.
  But the origin of that</span> <span m='2115000'>attraction is this induced dipole-induced
  dipole</span> <span m='2120000'>interaction. You can make two argon atoms</span>
  <span m='2125000'>stick to each other. But now, I do want to compare</span> <span
  m='2132000'>this energy of interaction right here between two argons with the</span>
  <span m='2139000'>energy of interaction between two hydrogen atoms that are</span>
  <span m='2145000'>covalently bonded. The energy of interaction</span> <span m='2150000'>between
  two hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded,</span> <span m='2156000'>what does
  that look like? Here are the two hydrogens</span> <span m='2163000'>separated, and
  the bond length, here, is 432 kilojoules per</span> <span m='2172000'>mole. Look
  at how much stronger the H</span> <span m='2177000'>two bond is in the case of a
  covalently bound molecule,</span> <span m='2186000'>432 as compared to the 0.996
  in the case of the argon.</span> </p><p><span m='2196000'>Look at what the equilibrium
  distance is, here,</span> <span m='2200000'>in the case of H two. It is 0.74 angstroms,</span>
  <span m='2205000'>compared to 3.8 angstroms in the case of argon.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2209000'>This is not a covalent bond, the induced dipole-induced</span> <span
  m='2214000'>dipole, but it is a bond. But now, you might say that was</span> <span
  m='2221000'>not really a fair comparison because hydrogen is much smaller</span>
  <span m='2226000'>than argon and, of course, the bond length in</span> <span m='2231000'>hydrogen
  is going to be much smaller than that in two argon</span> <span m='2237000'>atoms.
  Therefore, if the two hydrogens</span> <span m='2240000'>are much closer together,
  then the energy of interaction</span> <span m='2246000'>has got to be much stronger.
  Well, to show you that isn't</span> <span m='2252000'>really the appropriate way
  to think about it,</span> <span m='2257000'>look at this diagram, here, on the side
  board,</span> <span m='2262000'>where what I am plotting for you is the argon-argon</span>
  <span m='2267000'>interaction potential. Here it is.</span> </p><p><span m='2271000'>It
  is this light kind of reddish line,</span> <span m='2275000'>argon-argon. Versus
  the chlorine-chlorine.</span> </p><p><span m='2281000'>Here is chlorine-chlorine.
  Argon and chlorine are about</span> <span m='2285000'>the same mass. They are about
  the same size.</span> </p><p><span m='2288000'>What do you see? Well, you still
  see that the</span> <span m='2292000'>argon-argon interaction is much weaker.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2295000'>You can hardly see, in this drawing,</span> <span m='2297000'>the
  attractive part of the interaction potential on this</span> <span m='2302000'>scale.
  Chlorine-chlorine,</span> <span m='2303000'>on the other hand, look at that,</span>
  <span m='2306000'>minus 200 kilojoules per mole. And chlorine-chlorine is much</span>
  <span m='2312000'>closer in. The equilibrium bond length,</span> <span m='2315000'>what
  is it? 1.9, or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='2318000'>Whereas, we
  have 3.8 over here for argon-argon.</span> </p><p><span m='2322000'>In that covalent
  bond between two chlorine atoms,</span> <span m='2326000'>that is a different interaction
  than this induced dipole-induced</span> <span m='2331000'>dipole where we have overlaps
  of electrons, the wave functions</span> <span m='2336000'>constructively, destructively
  interfering.</span> </p><p><span m='2341000'>That is different than the induced
  dipole-induced dipole</span> <span m='2347000'>interaction. Now, it turns out that
  we</span> <span m='2351000'>actually do have a nice analytical form for the</span>
  <span m='2357000'>interaction potential due to these induced dipole-induced</span>
  <span m='2363000'>dipole interactions.</span> </p><p><span m='2372000'>Let's take
  a look at that. They are sometimes called</span> <span m='2376000'>dispersion interactions.
  We leave off the name London.</span> </p><p><span m='2381000'>We have a nice analytical
  form for these dispersion</span> <span m='2385000'>interactions. And the name of
  that analytical</span> <span m='2389000'>form is the Lennard-Jones potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2400000'>Lennard-Jones was way ahead of his time, a gentleman in
  England</span> <span m='2406000'>in the late 1800s who decided when he got married
  that it was</span> <span m='2412000'>not really fair for his wife, whose last name
  was Lennard,</span> <span m='2418000'>to take his name. So, they both had hyphenated</span>
  <span m='2423000'>last names, Lennard-Jones. That is Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='2427000'>Lennard-Jones.
  And that potential function</span> <span m='2432000'>looks like this. We are going
  to call it capital</span> <span m='2435000'>U, LJ, Lennard-Jones.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2438000'>It is going to be as a function of r.</span> </p><p><span m='2440000'>R
  is the distance between, I am going to use argon as the</span> <span m='2445000'>example,
  the two argon atoms. That is going to be equal to 4</span> <span m='2449000'>times
  epsilon, I will explain what epsilon is,</span> <span m='2452000'>times (sigma over
  r) to the 12 power, I will explain was sigma</span> <span m='2457000'>is in a moment,
  --</span> <span m='2460000'>-- minus (sigma over r) to the 6 power.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2467000'>That is my potential form. Now, when I plot it,</span> <span m='2471000'>it
  is going to look like every other interaction potential that</span> <span m='2476000'>we
  have drawn here because I cannot, on the board,</span> <span m='2480000'>draw things
  very accurately. This is argon plus argon,</span> <span m='2484000'>way out here.
  This is a function of r.</span> </p><p><span m='2489000'>We are going to start out
  at zero, this is going to go down</span> <span m='2493000'>and then come back up.
  That is the general form,</span> <span m='2497000'>and this is the actual expression
  for that interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2502000'>What are these parameters,
  here?</span> </p><p><span m='2504000'>Well, the epsilon is this well depth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2507000'>It is measured from the bottom of the well, although the
  argon</span> <span m='2512000'>atoms are never at the bottom of the well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2516000'>They have the zero point energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2520000'>This
  epsilon, here, is this energy,</span> <span m='2523000'>from the bottom to the dissociated
  atom limit.</span> </p><p><span m='2528000'>What is this sigma? Well, this sigma
  is related to</span> <span m='2533000'>the equilibrium bond length. In the Lennard-Jones
  potential,</span> <span m='2539000'>here, the equilibrium bond length is equal to
  1.12 sigma.</span> </p><p><span m='2545000'>That is a parameter. To get it, you
  would take the</span> <span m='2551000'>derivative of the potential function, set
  it equal to zero,</span> <span m='2556000'>calculate the value of r, and that would
  give you a zero</span> <span m='2560000'>in that derivative. That is a maximum or
  a minimum.</span> </p><p><span m='2564000'>And it will turn out to be a minimum
  in this case.</span> </p><p><span m='2568000'>That is what sigma is. What are these
  two components,</span> <span m='2572000'>right here? This component,</span> <span
  m='2574000'>this (sigma over r) to the 12.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>What
  this describes are the repulsions in this interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2586000'>It
  is a good description of the core electron-core electron</span> <span m='2593000'>repulsion.
  Not the repulsion due to the</span> <span m='2598000'>outermost electrons in argon,
  but the repulsion due to the</span> <span m='2605000'>core electrons, the n equal
  one,</span> <span m='2608000'>the n equal two electrons. And it describes the</span>
  <span m='2615000'>nuclear-nuclear repulsion. It is a (one over r) to the 12</span>
  <span m='2622000'>dependence. If I plot that,</span> <span m='2627000'>it would
  look something like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2631000'>It is repulsive everywhere.
  It is what we call a</span> <span m='2637000'>short-range interaction. And this
  is important.</span> </p><p><span m='2644000'>What do we mean by short-range? Well,
  short-range means that it</span> <span m='2650000'>only has a value when r is small
  because it is a one over r</span> <span m='2656000'>raised to the 12 power.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2659000'>If r is large, and you put a large number in</span> <span
  m='2664000'>the denominator and raise it to the 12 power,</span> <span m='2668000'>the
  result is nothing. The result is something close</span> <span m='2674000'>to zero.
  This first term is zero when r</span> <span m='2678000'>is very large. That is why
  we call it a</span> <span m='2682000'>short-range interaction. And you can see that
  this</span> <span m='2687000'>really starts taking on value when r is pretty small.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2692000'>But then there is this part, the (sigma over r) to the
  6</span> <span m='2698000'>term. That is the attractive</span> <span m='2704000'>interactions.
  If I were to plot that,</span> <span m='2707000'>it would look like that. That is
  the induced</span> <span m='2711000'>dipole-induced dipole interaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2714000'>We could actually write down the energy of interaction</span> <span
  m='2719000'>between these two induced dipoles and find out that this</span> <span
  m='2724000'>is a one over the r to the 6 power.</span> </p><p><span m='2730000'>We
  are not going to do that, but we could do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2734000'>These
  are always attractive. The sum of the two,</span> <span m='2738000'>of course, gives
  us the actual shape of that interaction</span> <span m='2742000'>potential. But
  this interaction,</span> <span m='2745000'>here, is longer range, or we call it
  longer range.</span> </p><p><span m='2749000'>It is longer range because it is only
  one over r to the 6.</span> </p><p><span m='2754000'>And so r does not have to be</span>
  <span m='2757000'>that small in order for this term to make the contribution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2764000'>As r has a larger power here in the denominator,</span>
  <span m='2768000'>that is shorter range interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2772000'>As
  it gets a smaller power in the denominator,</span> <span m='2777000'>that is a shorter
  range interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2780000'>The other thing that is interesting
  and important here</span> <span m='2786000'>is this value of sigma. And I said that
  r sub e was</span> <span m='2793000'>1.12 times this sigma.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2797000'>The value of sigma is actually the definition of what we call a</span>
  <span m='2804000'>van der Waal's radius. That is, in the case of argon</span> <span
  m='2810000'>here, the equilibrium bond length is 1.12 sigma.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2815000'>And so, r sub e, 1.12 sigma.</span> </p><p><span m='2820000'>For argon
  that parameter is 3.4 angstroms.</span> </p><p><span m='2828000'>And so the bond
  length is 3.8 angstroms.</span> </p><p><span m='2836000'>But the van der Waal's
  radius is given by this 1.12 sigma over</span> <span m='2852000'>in this case 1.9
  here, is the radius that you use in</span> <span m='2857000'>these space filling
  models. On the side wall,</span> <span m='2862000'>that top model is a space filling
  model.</span> </p><p><span m='2866000'>And somehow you have to decide, how large
  should those</span> <span m='2871000'>hydrogens be that are sticking out in space
  that are not bonded</span> <span m='2877000'>to anything? And the radii that are
  used are</span> <span m='2883000'>these van der Waal's radii, because that is the
  radius at</span> <span m='2888000'>which you have this attractive interaction due
  to the induced</span> <span m='2894000'>dipole-induced dipole. And that is how those
  sizes are</span> <span m='2900115'>determined.</span> </p>
