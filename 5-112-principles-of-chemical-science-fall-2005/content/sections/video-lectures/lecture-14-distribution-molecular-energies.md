  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Last time, we went through
  the same arguments that Maxwell and</span> <span m='21000'>Boltzmann did to understand
  the microscopic origin of the ideal</span> <span m='27000'>gas law, PV equal nRT.</span>
  </p><p><span m='32000'>And we saw how Maxwell had hypothesized that the pressure</span>
  <span m='38000'>of a gas on the walls of some container, if the molecules were</span>
  <span m='45000'>moving and they collided onto the walls, that pressure must be</span>
  <span m='51000'>due to the individual impacts of the molecules on the wall.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59000'>That must be due to the change in the momentum of the wall
  when</span> <span m='64000'>the molecules slammed right into it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67000'>And that change in momentum over some change in time is this</span> <span
  m='72000'>force. That force divided by the total</span> <span m='76000'>area is
  the pressure. And it was using that argument</span> <span m='80000'>that we came
  up with an expression, just like Maxwell</span> <span m='85000'>did for the pressure
  times the volume.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>And we see that we were able to
  write it in terms of the</span> <span m='94000'>velocity of the molecules that were
  moving in this gas.</span> </p><p><span m='99000'>Well, that is very nice because
  if we have this theoretical</span> <span m='104000'>expression P times V, and we
  know experimentally that</span> <span m='108000'>P times V equal nRT, if this theory
  is</span> <span m='112000'>correct, then this quantity n M, average of the velocity</span>
  <span m='117000'>squared, over three, that better be equal to nRT.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121000'>Or, solving for what we call</span> <span m='127000'>the root mean square
  velocity, that better be equal to the</span> <span m='131000'>square root of 3RT
  over M.</span> </p><p><span m='135000'>That kinetic theory made a prediction for
  what the velocity</span> <span m='139000'>ought to be. It took, of course,</span>
  <span m='142000'>another hundred years before somebody could measure that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='146000'>And, of course, it is correct.</span> </p><p><span m='148000'>But
  what is interesting here is that this model gave us an</span> <span m='152000'>understanding
  for what temperature is.</span> </p><p><span m='157000'>Temperature is a measure
  of the speed of the molecules in the</span> <span m='161000'>gas. It is also, as
  we saw last</span> <span m='164000'>time, a measure of their kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='167000'>We saw that the kinetic energy is one-half M average of
  the</span> <span m='172000'>velocity squared. We put</span> <span m='176000'>in
  our result from kinetic theory.</span> </p><p><span m='180000'>That shows us that
  the average energy is three-halves RT.</span> </p><p><span m='185000'>Temperature
  is the measure of</span> <span m='188000'>the kinetic energy of these molecules
  in the gas.</span> </p><p><span m='192000'>For the first time, there was a microscopic</span>
  <span m='195000'>understanding of what temperature was.</span> </p><p><span m='198000'>Now,
  what we looked at also, last time, was the</span> <span m='202000'>Maxwell-Boltzmann
  distribution of velocities or speeds and</span> <span m='207000'>talked about this
  particular functional form.</span> </p><p><span m='212000'>How there was this quadratic
  dependence right here,</span> <span m='215000'>a low v because of the v squared
  here and then an</span> <span m='219000'>exponentially decaying tail. There were
  two parameters,</span> <span m='224000'>the mass and the temperature. We talked
  about that last time.</span> </p><p><span m='228000'>But, of course, if there is
  a distribution here</span> <span m='232000'>of speeds where this distribution is
  a probability of</span> <span m='236000'>finding a molecule with a particular speed
  between v and v</span> <span m='241000'>plus dv, -- -- then there also has to be
  a</span> <span m='245000'>distribution of energies because the velocity is related
  to the</span> <span m='249000'>energy. What do we have to do?</span> </p><p><span
  m='251000'>We have to take that Maxwell-Boltzmann speed</span> <span m='254000'>distribution
  and change the variable to energy.</span> </p><p><span m='258000'>We know how to
  do that. We know how to equate those two</span> <span m='262000'>distribution functions.
  And, using the Jacobean of the</span> <span m='266000'>transformation that we talked
  about last time,</span> <span m='269000'>we can calculate what the energy distribution
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='274000'>f of E is our Maxwell-Boltzmann energy</span>
  <span m='277000'>distribution. It is the probability of</span> <span m='280000'>finding
  a molecule with a kinetic energy E to E plus dE.</span> </p><p><span m='285000'>It
  also has a decaying exponential term,</span> <span m='288000'>here, with the energy
  in the argument, and it is multiplied</span> <span m='293000'>by E of the one-half.
  Let's take a look at what that</span> <span m='297000'>distribution function looks
  like.</span> </p><p><span m='301000'>Here it is. Notice, as we learned last</span>
  <span m='304000'>time, that the energy has nothing to do with the mass of</span>
  <span m='309000'>the particle. The only parameter that is</span> <span m='312000'>important
  is the temperature. At a given temperature,</span> <span m='317000'>all particles,
  it doesn't matter what their</span> <span m='321000'>mass is, have the same energy.
  So, all particles at</span> <span m='326000'>degrees Kelvin have a Maxwell-Boltzmann
  energy</span> <span m='330000'>distribution that looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='335000'>There is a very rapid rise in that distribution function,</span> <span
  m='339000'>unlike the velocity distribution,</span> <span m='342000'>which increased
  as v squared.</span> </p><p><span m='345000'>It peaks rapidly, and then there is
  an</span> <span m='348000'>exponentially decaying term in the energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='352000'>At 1500 degrees Kelvin, the energy distribution looks</span> <span m='356000'>like
  this. The energy of the molecules has</span> <span m='359000'>increased. Since this
  is a probability,</span> <span m='364000'>and the area under these curves has to
  equal to one,</span> <span m='367000'>if the energy goes up, that is we have more
  molecules</span> <span m='371000'>out here with higher energies, well, then this
  maximum value</span> <span m='376000'>for the probabilities has got to go down because
  we have to keep</span> <span m='381000'>the area under that curve equal to one,
  since this is a</span> <span m='385000'>probability. What we see here,</span> <span
  m='388000'>as we raise the energy, is that we have more and more</span> <span m='393000'>molecules
  with high energies. There are not a lot of them,</span> <span m='398000'>but there
  are some. And they are going to be really</span> <span m='402000'>important in the
  example I am going to show you in just a</span> <span m='407000'>moment. Average
  energy at 600 Kelvin,</span> <span m='411000'>just three-halves RT, is 7.5 kilojoules
  per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='415000'>Average energy at 1500 Kelvin is 18.7 kilojoules
  per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='422000'>But now, I want to show you an example
  of the importance of</span> <span m='427000'>this Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
  function for</span> <span m='432000'>energies to chemical reactions, the importance
  of it in making</span> <span m='438000'>some kinds of chemical reactions actually
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='443000'>And so the example is going to be this reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='449000'>This reaction is called steam reforming of natural gas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='452000'>It is the reaction of methane plus water.</span> </p><p><span
  m='455000'>Natural gas is mostly methane. But this reaction of methane</span> <span
  m='459000'>and water makes CO and hydrogen. It</span> <span m='463000'>turns out
  that this reaction does not work in the gas phase.</span> </p><p><span m='467000'>That
  is, if you have a methane molecule and water molecule</span> <span m='471000'>collide,
  they are just going to collide, bounce apart and go in</span> <span m='476000'>their
  opposite directions. They are not going to make CO</span> <span m='479000'>and hydrogen.
  And so what you have to have in</span> <span m='484000'>this reaction to make it
  go is a catalyst.</span> </p><p><span m='488000'>That catalyst is going to be a
  nickel surface.</span> </p><p><span m='491000'>A catalyst is something that will
  lower the activation energy</span> <span m='497000'>barrier by changing the mechanism
  of a reaction so that</span> <span m='501000'>the reaction can proceed. In this
  case,</span> <span m='504000'>what happens is that the methane and the water impinge
  on</span> <span m='509000'>this nickel metal catalyst. And the methane and the water</span>
  <span m='515000'>decompose. They fall apart to their</span> <span m='518000'>elements
  on that nickel surface. And then, once you have carbon,</span> <span m='523000'>hydrogen
  and oxygen on that nickel surface,</span> <span m='526000'>the atoms rearrange and
  come off as CO and molecular</span> <span m='530000'>hydrogen. So, that nickel surface
  is a</span> <span m='533000'>catalyst. We call this the catalytic</span> <span m='536000'>reaction.
  In particular,</span> <span m='539000'>we call it a heterogeneous catalytic reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='542000'>It is heterogeneous because the catalyst is in a different
  phase</span> <span m='548000'>than the reactants. The catalyst here is a solid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='552000'>The reactants are gases. A homogeneous catalyst is one</span>
  <span m='556000'>in which the phase of the catalyst and the reactants is</span>
  <span m='561000'>the same. This is a heterogeneous</span> <span m='564000'>catalytic
  reaction. It turns out that this reaction</span> <span m='568000'>here is really
  an important reaction from the standpoint of</span> <span m='573000'>the production
  of hydrogen. All of the hydrogen that you</span> <span m='579000'>use, you know,
  if you are doing a laboratory</span> <span m='582000'>experiment and you go get
  a tank of hydrogen, that hydrogen is</span> <span m='587000'>made by this reaction,
  by reacting methane and water</span> <span m='591000'>to form that hydrogen. All
  of our commercial sources</span> <span m='595000'>of hydrogen come from carrying
  out this reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>For example, if you are in the
  business of</span> <span m='603000'>ammonia synthesis, which is taking hydrogen
  and</span> <span m='608000'>nitrogen to make ammonia, which is also carried out
  on an</span> <span m='613000'>iron surface, another heterogeneous catalytic</span>
  <span m='617000'>reaction. And ammonia,</span> <span m='619000'>of course, is the
  starting material for lots of chemicals,</span> <span m='624000'>in particular fertilizers.
  If you have an ammonia plant,</span> <span m='630000'>right next to the ammonia
  plant you have a steamer-forming plant</span> <span m='635000'>to make the hydrogen
  to feed into this reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='639000'>And another place where
  this is useful is in methanol synthesis.</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>That is,
  you can take hydrogen and CO on a copper zinc oxide</span> <span m='649000'>heterogeneous
  catalyst and make methanol, the starting point for</span> <span m='654000'>gasoline,
  which now is certainly economically feasible.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>But
  it turns out that this reaction here is really a hard</span> <span m='665000'>one
  to carry out. Despite the fact that nickel is</span> <span m='669000'>a catalyst
  for the reaction and makes it go, the reaction still</span> <span m='675000'>has
  to be carried out at very high temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m='680000'>1500
  degrees kelvin is a very high temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='684000'>It also
  needs very high pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='689000'>And one of the reasons
  why we don't have a hydrogen economy is</span> <span m='693000'>because it is so
  difficult to make.</span> </p><p><span m='696000'>Hydrogen can be done, and it is
  done in all of the</span> <span m='699000'>commercial processes that I mentioned
  to you,</span> <span m='703000'>but it is still hard. 1500 degrees kelvin,</span>
  <span m='706000'>high pressures. The question is,</span> <span m='708000'>why is
  it so hard? Why is there this barrier here?</span> </p><p><span m='712000'>Why do
  we need to raise the temperature of the gas in order</span> <span m='716000'>to
  get this reaction to go? Well, let's take a look at</span> <span m='722000'>that.
  What there exists here in this</span> <span m='725000'>problem is what is called
  an activation energy barrier to</span> <span m='729000'>making the reaction go.
  It turns out that this</span> <span m='733000'>activation energy barrier is really
  in the very first step of</span> <span m='738000'>the reaction, which is pulling
  the methane</span> <span m='742000'>apart, pulling that first hydrogen atom off
  of the methane</span> <span m='747000'>molecule. What I represent right here is</span>
  <span m='751000'>the energy of the reaction as a function of the reaction,</span>
  <span m='756000'>and the reaction here is just the first step.</span> </p><p><span
  m='760000'>It is taking methane gas, pulling the hydrogen off so</span> <span m='765000'>that
  you have a methyl radical stuck to the surface and you</span> <span m='770000'>have
  a hydrogen atom stuck to the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='774000'>It is just
  breaking that first C-H bond.</span> </p><p><span m='779000'>What you can see here
  is that you have to put 50 kilojoules of</span> <span m='784000'>energy into that
  reaction in order to make it go.</span> </p><p><span m='788000'>You have to put
  that 50 kilocalories of energy in first,</span> <span m='792000'>before you get
  any energy back. You can see that this is</span> <span m='797000'>exothermic. But
  you have to put this energy</span> <span m='800000'>in, in order to get that reaction
  to go.</span> </p><p><span m='803000'>Well, how do we know that? Let me back up
  a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='809000'>Here is where the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy</span>
  <span m='811000'>distribution is important. What I did was I took those</span> <span
  m='815000'>Boltzmann energy distributions that I plotted for you at</span> <span
  m='819000'>Kelvin and 1500 Kelvin and turned them on their side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='823000'>This is essentially equal to the probability of finding a</span> <span
  m='827000'>molecule at a particular energy versus the energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='831000'>Here is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 600 degrees</span> <span
  m='835000'>Kelvin. It is peaked to very low</span> <span m='837000'>energies. And,
  if you look here in this</span> <span m='841000'>Maxwell-Boltzmann tail, there are
  not very many</span> <span m='845000'>molecules that have enough energy to get over
  that barrier.</span> </p><p><span m='850000'>However, if we raise the temperature
  of the gas to</span> <span m='854000'>degrees Kelvin, then now you can see that
  there</span> <span m='858000'>are more molecules here in the high energy part of
  this tail.</span> </p><p><span m='863000'>And it is these molecules at these high
  energies that</span> <span m='867000'>actually can get over this barrier to dissociation
  of the</span> <span m='872000'>methane molecule. They are not many of those</span>
  <span m='876000'>molecules with high energy, but there are some.</span> </p><p><span
  m='879000'>And that is important, because what happens is when</span> <span m='882000'>they
  have enough energy, they react and they leave.</span> </p><p><span m='885000'>And
  then this Boltzmann distribution re-equilibrates.</span> </p><p><span m='889000'>If
  the high energy molecules leave, then there are lots of</span> <span m='892000'>collisions
  here that kick some more molecules up to the high</span> <span m='896000'>energy
  part of the tail, and they react.</span> </p><p><span m='900000'>And so it works.
  That is why it is important.</span> </p><p><span m='904000'>How do we really know
  that there is this barrier here to</span> <span m='909000'>the dissociation of methane,
  and why is there this barrier?</span> </p><p><span m='915000'>What is the physical
  origin of this barrier to pulling this C-H</span> <span m='921000'>bond apart? Well,
  one way we could know</span> <span m='925000'>that there was this barrier there
  for sure is to do the</span> <span m='930000'>following. If we had a way to take
  methane</span> <span m='935000'>gas and make it have just a single energy,</span>
  <span m='938000'>not the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of energies that</span>
  <span m='941000'>have lots of different energies, which have lots of different</span>
  <span m='946000'>energies in them, and you saw how broad those</span> <span m='949000'>curves
  were. But if we had a way to make</span> <span m='951000'>methane gas with just
  say energy E sub 1, whatever that is,</span> <span m='956000'>we could then take
  those molecules with just those</span> <span m='959000'>energies, aim them at this
  nickel surface,</span> <span m='962000'>and see if the methane fell apart.</span>
  </p><p><span m='966000'>And, if it didn't, then we would prepare molecules</span>
  <span m='969000'>at some higher energy and see if they fell apart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='973000'>If they didn't then we would go to higher energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='976000'>We would keep going until we got to the top of the barrier.</span> </p><p><span
  m='980000'>Well, how do you do that? How do you make molecules with</span> <span
  m='984000'>a particular energy? Because I just showed you a</span> <span m='988000'>Maxwell-Boltzmann
  energy distribution at 300 Kelvin,</span> <span m='992000'>600 Kelvin. There are
  a lot of energies</span> <span m='997000'>present. How do we make molecules with</span>
  <span m='1001000'>just one energy? We have a way to do that by</span> <span m='1006000'>using
  some beam techniques and high pressure adiabatic</span> <span m='1012000'>expansions.
  Basically, the way it works is</span> <span m='1017000'>this. What we are going
  to do is take</span> <span m='1021000'>a tube here, which is going to have a high
  pressure of methane</span> <span m='1027000'>in it. Then we are going to punch a</span>
  <span m='1030000'>little hole in that tube. This tube is actually sitting</span>
  <span m='1034000'>in a vacuum, so we are going to expand the methane from that</span>
  <span m='1039000'>tube into the vacuum. We are going to squirt it out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1044000'>It is going to become a beam of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1049000'>But
  when you expand a gas from high pressure to low pressure,</span> <span m='1054000'>this
  expansion is called an adiabatic expansion,</span> <span m='1058000'>which means
  the gas cools. I will explain that in a</span> <span m='1062000'>moment, but the
  adiabatic expansion you are going to talk</span> <span m='1067000'>a lot about in
  5.60. And, if you are a chemical</span> <span m='1070000'>engineer, you will talk
  even more about it past 5.60.</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>Here is how it works.
  You take these molecules and</span> <span m='1079000'>squirt them out. Because the
  pressure right here</span> <span m='1084000'>is so high, what happens is there are
  lots and lots and lots</span> <span m='1088000'>of collisions. And so, you can imagine,</span>
  <span m='1091000'>if you have some slow molecule just kind of lumbering along and</span>
  <span m='1095000'>a fast one comes and hits you, what is going to happen is you</span>
  <span m='1100000'>are going to speed up, and the fast one is going to</span> <span
  m='1103000'>slow down. And, if you keep doing that</span> <span m='1106000'>again
  and again and again, all the molecules are going to</span> <span m='1110000'>end
  up with the same energy or the same velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='1115000'>If
  you have so many collisions, after a while they are going to</span> <span m='1119000'>all
  have the same velocity or the same energy because one gets</span> <span m='1124000'>sped
  up, one gets slowed down. They are all going to end up</span> <span m='1128000'>with
  the same energy. That is what happens.</span> </p><p><span m='1131000'>That is how
  we make a beam of molecules, a source of molecules</span> <span m='1136000'>with
  the same kinetic energy. And basically,</span> <span m='1140000'>what is happening
  then is that before the expansion,</span> <span m='1143000'>just look at this curve,
  here is an actual Boltzmann</span> <span m='1147000'>distribution of velocities.
  It is broad.</span> </p><p><span m='1150000'>But after this expansion, here is the
  distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='1154000'>It is really pretty narrow. If you
  put a temperature to</span> <span m='1158000'>that distribution, you might find
  that at one</span> <span m='1161000'>degree Kelvin, you can really make molecules</span>
  <span m='1164000'>with a single or very narrow distribution in energies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1170000'>That is what we do. We make those molecules with</span>
  <span m='1173000'>this energy E sub 1. Then we have some more tricks</span> <span
  m='1178000'>for changing those energies in a controlled way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1181000'>And we just keep cranking those energies up and watch to see</span>
  <span m='1186000'>when the methane falls apart. And so, you get data that kind</span>
  <span m='1191000'>of looks like this. This is a dissociation</span> <span m='1194000'>probability
  of a methane as a function of its energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1198000'>This is
  in kilocalories per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1202000'>At some point, say right
  about here,</span> <span m='1205000'>15 kilocalories per mole, the dissociation
  probability</span> <span m='1210000'>skyrockets. All of a sudden,</span> <span m='1213000'>you
  are at a high enough energy to get that methane to fall</span> <span m='1218000'>apart.
  This tells you exactly where</span> <span m='1222000'>that barrier is. But now,
  the question is,</span> <span m='1226000'>why is there this barrier? Physically,
  why is there a</span> <span m='1232000'>barrier to pulling the hydrogen off of the
  carbon when that</span> <span m='1238000'>methane molecule comes close to the surface?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1243000'>Well, the reason is this. In order to break the</span>
  <span m='1248000'>carbon-hydrogen bond in methane, in order to have enough energy</span>
  <span m='1254000'>to break that bond, what you need to do is you need</span> <span
  m='1260000'>to simultaneously form a nickel-carbon bond and a</span> <span m='1265000'>nickel-hydrogen
  bond. In other words,</span> <span m='1270000'>when this methane molecule here comes
  into some nickel surface</span> <span m='1277000'>very slowly, because that methane
  is tetrahedral and the</span> <span m='1283000'>carbon is kind of hidden in the
  center, the hydrogens interact</span> <span m='1290000'>with the nickel. But the
  carbon does not get in</span> <span m='1295000'>close enough to the nickel to start
  to form a nickel-carbon</span> <span m='1299000'>bond. Now, if you speed that methane</span>
  <span m='1302000'>molecule up and you really ram it into the surface,</span> <span
  m='1306000'>upon collision of the molecule with the surface,</span> <span m='1309000'>the
  hydrogens are pushed back, the carbon gets in close enough</span> <span m='1314000'>to
  the nickel to start to form, here, this nickel-carbon bond.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1320000'>You form a nickel-hydrogen bond, and now you can break that</span> <span
  m='1325000'>C-H bond. We call this black chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='1329000'>The
  barrier, there, to that reaction</span> <span m='1332000'>physically is the amount
  of energy that you have to put into</span> <span m='1338000'>the molecule to push
  those hydrogens back,</span> <span m='1342000'>to bend those hydrogens back to distort
  this methane molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>Once you do that, the reaction
  goes.</span> </p><p><span m='1353000'>You are on a roll there. It goes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1355000'>So, that is the physical origin of this barrier,</span> <span m='1359000'>here,
  to the dissociation of methane.</span> </p><p><span m='1363000'>You need to put
  enough kinetic energy into those methane</span> <span m='1367000'>molecules in order
  to get over that barrier.</span> </p><p><span m='1371000'>And we do that on a practical
  scale by raising the temperature</span> <span m='1376000'>of the gas. And on a microscopic
  scale,</span> <span m='1381000'>this is what is happening. You can imagine that
  my</span> <span m='1386000'>students and I did this experiment 15 years ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1391000'>But then, we said if this barrier here is the energy</span>
  <span m='1396000'>required to deform that methane molecule, then we should be able</span>
  <span m='1402000'>to do this experiment. This experiment is the</span> <span m='1406000'>following.
  We are going to take our nickel</span> <span m='1411000'>surface, here, and lower
  the temperature of</span> <span m='1414000'>the surface to 47 kelvin. At that temperature,</span>
  <span m='1418000'>what we can do is we can freeze a layer of methane on the</span>
  <span m='1422000'>surface. We call it fizzy-sorb,</span> <span m='1424000'>a layer
  of methane on the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1427000'>It will just stick there.
  And then, if this barrier is</span> <span m='1431000'>the energy required to deform
  or to start the molecule,</span> <span m='1435000'>then in principle I could take
  a hammer and pound that molecule</span> <span m='1439000'>into the correct shape
  for the transition state that leads to</span> <span m='1444000'>dissociation. It
  sounds like a simple idea,</span> <span m='1449000'>and it is, except that we cannot
  really take that hammer.</span> </p><p><span m='1454000'>But we can take an argon
  atom. We can freeze the methane onto</span> <span m='1459000'>the surface, and now
  we come in with an argon atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1463000'>That is just a big
  ball. Or, a xenon atom or a krypton</span> <span m='1467000'>atom. And we know how
  to accelerate</span> <span m='1470000'>xenon or krypton. We don't accelerate it
  too</span> <span m='1475000'>much, 50 kilocalories, 70 kilocalories per mole,</span>
  <span m='1478000'>something like that. And then we can bring it in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1482000'>What happens is that the impact of the collision on that methane</span>
  <span m='1487000'>causes that methane molecule to compress, distort,</span> <span
  m='1491000'>gets it into the configuration of the transition state that</span> <span
  m='1496000'>leads to the methane falling apart.</span> </p><p><span m='1500000'>And
  so, you get the same result.</span> </p><p><span m='1502000'>The question, there,
  is just getting the</span> <span m='1505000'>energy into the molecule to actually
  distort it,</span> <span m='1509000'>to deform it so that you can make the nickel-carbon
  bond and</span> <span m='1514000'>the nickel-hydrogen bond. That is the key.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1518000'>My students and I, after we had spent many years</span>
  <span m='1522000'>doing this experiment and spent a lot of money on this</span>
  <span m='1526000'>experiment, said we have proven for sure that when a bug flies</span>
  <span m='1531000'>into the windshield of your car, you do get the same result as</span>
  <span m='1536000'>if you hit the bug on the windshield of your car with a</span>
  <span m='1541000'>bug swatter. That is what we get.</span> </p><p><span m='1546000'>This
  is an example of one chemical reaction for which we</span> <span m='1551000'>know
  the physical origin of the barrier.</span> </p><p><span m='1555000'>There are very
  few chemical reactions for which we know</span> <span m='1561000'>anything about
  the physical origin of a barrier to a</span> <span m='1566000'>reaction. Now, what
  I want to talk about</span> <span m='1571000'>is go back to kinetic theory, because
  the kinetic theory is</span> <span m='1578000'>going to allow us to calculate a
  couple of more quantities that</span> <span m='1585000'>are of interest to us. And
  one of those quantities is</span> <span m='1591000'>the collision frequency. And
  let me just write that on</span> <span m='1597000'>the board here. What I am going
  to want to</span> <span m='1601000'>calculate is something called Z1, or I am going
  to call it Z1.</span> </p><p><span m='1607000'>It is the number of collisions that
  a molecule makes in a gas</span> <span m='1613000'>per unit time. And our unit time
  is going to</span> <span m='1618000'>be seconds. This is the collision frequency</span>
  <span m='1626000'>of a single molecule in a gas.</span> </p><p><span m='1648000'>How
  am I going to calculate the quantity using the kinetic</span> <span m='1649000'>theory
  approach that we have been talking about?</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>What I
  am going to do is this. I am going to take some gas,</span> <span m='1653000'>and
  the molecules in that gas are represented by these blue</span> <span m='1658000'>circles
  right here. They have a diameter D.</span> </p><p><span m='1662000'>And then, within
  that gas, I am going to imagine this</span> <span m='1667000'>lighter blue cylinder.
  That cylinder is an imaginary</span> <span m='1672000'>construct. We are going to
  use it to</span> <span m='1675000'>calculate this collision frequency.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1680000'>What it is going to be is the collision volume.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1684000'>I have set the diameter of that cylinder to be equal to two</span> <span
  m='1689000'>times the diameter of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1692000'>I
  have set this upright. And the bottom line is that all</span> <span m='1697000'>of
  the molecules that instantaneously happen to be in</span> <span m='1702000'>this
  cylinder when a molecule comes through,</span> <span m='1706000'>all of those molecules
  are actually going to be hit.</span> </p><p><span m='1712000'>They are going to
  suffer a collision with another molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1717000'>And I
  am going to use that, the number of molecules in this</span> <span m='1722000'>volume,
  to calculate this collision frequency.</span> </p><p><span m='1726000'>That is what
  I am going to do. Snapshot in time,</span> <span m='1731000'>those molecules are
  frozen there, except there is one</span> <span m='1736000'>smart-alecky molecule
  that comes cruising on through.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>Here he comes. Bam,
  bam, bam.</span> </p><p><span m='1744000'>Hits these three molecules, here, because
  they are more</span> <span m='1750000'>than halfway into that collision cylinder.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1754000'>What I know is this smart-aleck was moving at some average</span>
  <span m='1760000'>velocity, which I am going to call vbar.</span> </p><p><span m='1764000'>In
  a time T, this molecule,</span> <span m='1767000'>since it is moving with an average
  velocity vbar,</span> <span m='1772000'>in a time t, it is traveling a length vbar</span>
  <span m='1776000'>times t.</span> </p><p><span m='1781000'>Velocity times time,
  that is going to give you a</span> <span m='1784000'>length. And so, I am going
  to set,</span> <span m='1787000'>for convenience, this time equal to one second</span>
  <span m='1790000'>because that is going to be my unit of time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1793000'>I want to do this per second. I am going to set this equal to</span>
  <span m='1798000'>one second. Therefore, this molecule is</span> <span m='1802000'>going
  to travel a length vbar in one second.</span> </p><p><span m='1807000'>And that
  is the length that I am going to make the collision</span> <span m='1813000'>cylinder.
  I am going to make that</span> <span m='1816000'>collision cylinder be vbar long.
  That is the distance traveled</span> <span m='1822000'>in one second by this smart-alecky
  molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1828000'>Now, all I have to do is I have got to
  take the volume of the</span> <span m='1834000'>collision cylinder and multiply
  it by all the molecules that</span> <span m='1840000'>happen to be at the volume
  at that particular time.</span> </p><p><span m='1845000'>Because that volume represents
  the volume swept out in one</span> <span m='1851000'>second by this smart-alecky
  molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1855000'>What is the volume of the cylinder?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1860000'>I set the diameter to be equal to 2d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1863000'>The volume of the cylinder is the cross-sectional area times</span>
  <span m='1868000'>the length. That cross-sectional area,</span> <span m='1871000'>then,
  is pi r squared, but r here is equal to d,</span> <span m='1876000'>just to make
  it confusing. The area is pi d squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1881000'>The length
  is vbar.</span> </p><p><span m='1884000'>That is the volume of the cylinder, pi
  d squared vbar.</span> </p><p><span m='1888000'>So, we have the volume of the</span>
  <span m='1894000'>cylinder. Now what we are going to need</span> <span m='1897000'>to
  know is the density of the molecules in this cylinder,</span> <span m='1902000'>which
  is the density of the molecules in the gas.</span> </p><p><span m='1906000'>The
  cylinder is not special. The cylinder is an imaginary</span> <span m='1910000'>construct
  that I put in there to help me calculate the collision</span> <span m='1915000'>frequency.
  I need the density of the</span> <span m='1918000'>molecules in the gas or in the
  cylinder.</span> </p><p><span m='1923000'>The density of the molecules I am going
  to set as equal to N,</span> <span m='1927000'>the total number of molecules in
  this volume,</span> <span m='1930000'>divided by the volume of the gas.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1933000'>I am going to call that rho. N over V is going to be equal</span> <span
  m='1937000'>to rho. That is the number of molecules</span> <span m='1941000'>per
  cubic meter. That is the density of the gas.</span> </p><p><span m='1945000'>This
  is the symbol that I am going to use from now on for</span> <span m='1949000'>density
  defined as molecules per cubic meter.</span> </p><p><span m='1954000'>Then the collision
  frequency is simply going to be the density</span> <span m='1959000'>of the molecules
  times the volume of the cylinder.</span> </p><p><span m='1963000'>The collision
  frequency Z1, here, is this volume of the</span> <span m='1967000'>cylinder, pi
  d squared vbar times the density.</span> </p><p><span m='1972000'>Why?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1973000'>Because I set it up so that every molecule in that cylinder</span> <span
  m='1978000'>would suffer a collision. And that cylinder is the length</span> <span
  m='1984000'>that a molecule travels in one second.</span> </p><p><span m='1988000'>There
  is the density times the volume.</span> </p><p><span m='1991000'>The meters cubed
  disappears. What I have left is rho,</span> <span m='1996000'>the density, pi d
  squared vbar.</span> </p><p><span m='2000000'>This is collisions per second.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2004000'>So, I have my collision frequency.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2007000'>This is the single-molecule collision frequency.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2013000'>This is the frequency of collisions that one molecule</span> <span m='2017000'>makes
  with the other gas molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2020000'>That is important.
  We are going to do a different</span> <span m='2024000'>kind of collision frequency
  in just a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='2027000'>But now, it turns out that there
  is another factor here</span> <span m='2032000'>that I had left out because I haven't
  done as sophisticated of</span> <span m='2037000'>an analysis as I could. And that
  is that I made the</span> <span m='2042000'>assumption in my picture before that
  all the other molecules</span> <span m='2047000'>were frozen in time and that there
  was only one smart-aleck</span> <span m='2051000'>that was moving around, cruising
  through.</span> </p><p><span m='2055000'>The reality is they are all moving.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2057000'>And what I really have to do is I have to take into account
  the</span> <span m='2063000'>relative velocities of the molecules, the relative
  speeds.</span> </p><p><span m='2067000'>I can do that. There is a little more</span>
  <span m='2071000'>sophisticated analysis in doing that, but I could do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2076000'>And, if we do that, this makes a difference of the</span>
  <span m='2080000'>square root of two. I am just going to put that</span> <span m='2084000'>square
  root of two in there right now, and later on you will</span> <span m='2089000'>be
  able to see where that comes from, in a later course.</span> </p><p><span m='2094000'>That
  actually is the collision frequency of a single molecule</span> <span m='2099000'>in
  the gas.</span> </p><p><span m='2107000'>I am also interested in another quantity,
  which is the total</span> <span m='2112000'>collision frequency. That was the single
  collision</span> <span m='2116000'>frequency, but I am also interested in knowing
  how many</span> <span m='2121000'>collisions are occurring in the entire gas per
  unit time,</span> <span m='2126000'>the total collision frequency. You know why
  I am interested in</span> <span m='2132000'>that number? I am interested in that
  number</span> <span m='2136000'>because that is going to be the upper limit to any
  reaction</span> <span m='2141000'>rate. A reaction in the gas phase or</span> <span
  m='2144000'>in solution cannot happen any faster than the molecules</span> <span
  m='2149000'>collide. They have to collide before a</span> <span m='2152000'>reaction
  is going to occur. The total collision frequency,</span> <span m='2157000'>the importance
  of that number is that it is the upper limit to</span> <span m='2163000'>a reaction
  rate. Let's calculate that.</span> </p><p><span m='2168000'>Z is going to be equal
  to the collision frequency of one</span> <span m='2173000'>molecule, Z1, times the
  total number of</span> <span m='2177000'>molecules in the gas, N.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2181000'>That is what N stands for. But since each collision</span> <span m='2185000'>involves
  two molecules, I am going to have to multiply</span> <span m='2191000'>this by one-half.
  Otherwise, I am going to over</span> <span m='2196000'>count the number of collisions
  because each collision involves</span> <span m='2201000'>two molecules. The total
  collision frequency</span> <span m='2204000'>here is one-half times N times Z1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2208000'>Therefore, if I go and plug in my expression for Z1 and
  N and</span> <span m='2212000'>simplify things, my total collision frequency</span>
  <span m='2216000'>here is one over the square root of two times N times rho pi d</span>
  <span m='2221000'>squared times the average speed.</span> </p><p><span m='2226000'>That
  is my total collisions per</span> <span m='2231000'>second. This is not rocket science.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2235000'>This is easy. What I want you to realize is</span> <span
  m='2240000'>that you do have to understand what N is, what rho is,</span> <span
  m='2246000'>what d is, what vbar is. And I am always surprised on an</span> <span
  m='2252000'>exam, when we are going to give you this equation,</span> <span m='2258000'>that
  students don't actually know what rho is,</span> <span m='2263000'>or N is, or v
  is, or d is.</span> </p><p><span m='2268000'>This is easy. You do just have to understand,</span>
  <span m='2271000'>this is the total number of molecules in the gas,</span> <span
  m='2274000'>this is the density of the gas in molecules per cubic meter,</span>
  <span m='2278000'>the diameter of the molecule, the average speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2282000'>That was just a helpful hint. This is the upper limit to the</span>
  <span m='2287000'>reaction rate. When somebody tells you,</span> <span m='2290000'>the
  rate of this reaction is so and so many molecules per cubic</span> <span m='2295000'>meter
  per second, what you can do is a</span> <span m='2298000'>back-of-the-envelope calculation
  to see whether or not they are</span> <span m='2304000'>telling you the reaction
  rate is greater than this number.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>If it is, you
  can say ah-ha, got you, it cannot possibly be.</span> </p><p><span m='2315000'>Really
  important. If a reaction has this rate,</span> <span m='2320000'>it will mean that
  the probability of the reaction</span> <span m='2324000'>occurring is one. If the
  reaction has that rate,</span> <span m='2329000'>we call that the gas kinetic rate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2332000'>That is a term that we also use.</span> </p><p><span m='2335000'>Then,
  finally, one other quantity from the gas</span> <span m='2339000'>kinetic theory.
  Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2350000'>She asked, what velocity, here, would you use?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2353000'>You actually are going to, in that particular case,</span>
  <span m='2357000'>have to take the average of the average velocities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2361000'>In other words, if you had two different</span> <span m='2364000'>molecules
  that were reacting for this average velocity here,</span> <span m='2369000'>you
  are going to have to use the average of the average</span> <span m='2373000'>velocity.
  And then your error bars on the</span> <span m='2378000'>experiment will always
  be large enough to take that into</span> <span m='2384000'>consideration. Good question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2387000'>One other quantity, something called the mean free</span>
  <span m='2392000'>path. What I want to know,</span> <span m='2395000'>here, is on
  the average, how far does the molecule</span> <span m='2400000'>travel in the gas
  before it suffers a collision?</span> </p><p><span m='2407000'>That is what a mean
  free path is.</span> </p><p><span m='2409000'>A mean free path in solution. Sometimes
  you will do a solid</span> <span m='2413000'>state physics course and will hear
  about the electron mean</span> <span m='2417000'>free path. A mean free path is
  always the</span> <span m='2420000'>distance traveled between collisions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2422000'>That is what that is. And we are going to call it</span>
  <span m='2426000'>lambda. This is not wavelength anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='2430000'>We
  just changed our definition of lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='2433000'>Lambda, here,
  is the average distance between</span> <span m='2436000'>collisions. How are we
  going to calculate</span> <span m='2440000'>that? What we are going to do is take</span>
  <span m='2443000'>the average distance that a molecule travels per unit time,</span>
  <span m='2447000'>per second, and are going to divide it by the number of</span>
  <span m='2452000'>collisions that occur per second.</span> </p><p><span m='2455000'>And
  you are going to see that the per seconds are going to</span> <span m='2459000'>cancel
  here. We are going to have the</span> <span m='2463000'>average distance per collision.
  That is what we are after.</span> </p><p><span m='2468000'>This is easy to do because
  the average distance traveled per</span> <span m='2473000'>second is simply the
  average velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='2476000'>It is meters per second. The average
  distance traveled</span> <span m='2480000'>per second. The number of collisions
  per</span> <span m='2484000'>second that happened, we just calculated that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2487000'>That was Z1. We can substitute in Z1 vbar,</span> <span
  m='2493000'>vbar cancels, and what we are left with is</span> <span m='2498000'>one
  over the square root of 2 rho pi d squared.</span> </p><p><span m='2506000'>That
  is meters.</span> </p><p><span m='2509000'>That is the average distance the molecule
  traveled per</span> <span m='2516000'>collision. This is another general generic</span>
  <span m='2521000'>quantity useful in many cases, also in other kinds of cases</span>
  <span m='2526000'>that I just mentioned in solid state physics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2530000'>What I want to do now is that we said we were going to start</span>
  <span m='2536000'>talking about the motions of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2539000'>We
  have taken care of, now, the translational motion.</span> </p><p><span m='2544000'>Now
  I want to start talking about the internal degrees of</span> <span m='2549000'>freedom.
  And let's do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2553000'>Let me just see if I have something,
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2558000'>Let me raise the board, here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2578000'>We have talked about this molecule, which is a set of</span> <span m='2582000'>atoms
  that are bonded together. And, as we always say,</span> <span m='2587000'>they are
  bonded together for the mutual comfort of their</span> <span m='2592000'>electrons.
  And we saw that it is not</span> <span m='2595000'>frozen. It moves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2597000'>It has kinetic energy. It has velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='2600000'>The
  velocity generates this macroscopic property of</span> <span m='2605000'>pressure.
  But molecules also jiggle.</span> </p><p><span m='2610000'>For example, we are going
  to take here</span> <span m='2613000'>nitrogen, triple bond. That triple bond actually</span>
  <span m='2619000'>functions like a spring. We can think of that bond as a</span>
  <span m='2624000'>spring between the two atoms. That spring can stretch,</span>
  <span m='2629000'>and that spring can compress. When we tell you the</span> <span
  m='2634000'>equilibrium bond length of some molecule is some number,</span> <span
  m='2640000'>it is the equilibrium bond length.</span> </p><p><span m='2645000'>It
  is not the bond length when the molecule is stretched.</span> </p><p><span m='2649000'>It
  is not the bond length when the molecule is compressed.</span> </p><p><span m='2654000'>This
  motion is the vibrational motion of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2664000'>So,
  we have that kind of internal motion in a molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2670000'>Molecules
  also tumble. For example,</span> <span m='2673000'>let's take our nitrogen molecule,
  again.</span> </p><p><span m='2678000'>It rotates around an axis. Going through
  the center of the</span> <span m='2685000'>mass, it rotates around this axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2689000'>This nitrogen molecule also rotates around an axis,</span>
  <span m='2694000'>here, perpendicular to the board.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>It
  rotates in that direction. This is the rotational motion</span> <span m='2706000'>of
  the molecule. The different ways in which we</span> <span m='2711000'>can have this
  motion are called modes.</span> </p><p><span m='2715000'>This is a rotational mode.
  This is vibrational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='2721000'>We did not use the word
  before in talking about translation,</span> <span m='2728000'>but those are translational
  modes.</span> </p><p><span m='2733000'>Sometimes, we also call these modes degrees
  of freedom.</span> </p><p><span m='2740000'>A molecule has translational modes or
  degrees of freedom,</span> <span m='2749000'>vibrational degrees of freedom, and
  rotational degrees of</span> <span m='2757000'>freedom. Now, in general,</span>
  <span m='2760000'>if you have an N-atom molecule, you have 3N total modes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2770000'>When I say total modes that means the sum of translation,</span>
  <span m='2777000'>rotation and vibration. Of those 3N total modes,</span> <span
  m='2784000'>three of them are translational modes.</span> </p><p><span m='2795000'>Why
  do we have three translational modes?</span> </p><p><span m='2798000'>We have three
  translational modes because we are operating</span> <span m='2803000'>in a three-dimensional
  space. If we have a molecule here,</span> <span m='2808000'>that molecule has motion
  in the x direction, in the y direction,</span> <span m='2813000'>and also in the
  z direction. Those are the three</span> <span m='2817000'>translational modes of
  the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2822000'>What that means then, if three of
  the modes are used</span> <span m='2828000'>up for translation, then we must have
  3N minus 3</span> <span m='2833000'>internal modes. 3N minus 3 must be the number</span>
  <span m='2840000'>of modes that is leftover for the internal degrees of freedom</span>
  <span m='2847000'>for rotation and also for vibration.</span> </p><p><span m='2853000'>And
  what we are going to see, next time, is that these</span> <span m='2859000'>internal
  degrees of freedom, these internal modes are going</span> <span m='2866000'>to be
  quantized. That is, this molecule is going</span> <span m='2871000'>to be able to
  vibrate with only certain amounts of energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2879000'>There
  is going to be a ground vibrational state.</span> </p><p><span m='2882000'>There
  is going to be a first excited vibrational state.</span> </p><p><span m='2887000'>A
  second excited vibrational state, just like we talked about</span> <span m='2892000'>the
  energy levels of a hydrogen atom, where the electron was</span> <span m='2897000'>bound
  with different amounts of energy dictated by a principle</span> <span m='2902000'>quantum
  number. The vibrational degree of</span> <span m='2906000'>freedom is also going
  to be dictated by a vibrational</span> <span m='2910000'>quantum number. In addition,</span>
  <span m='2913000'>the rotations of the molecules, they are also quantized.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2918000'>A molecule is going to be able to rotate with only one
  energy,</span> <span m='2923000'>or another energy, or another energy,</span> <span
  m='2926000'>but not any energies in between.</span> </p><p><span m='2929000'>There
  are discrete rotational states.</span> </p><p><span m='2932000'>We are going to
  be talking about another kind of quantum</span> <span m='2936000'>number. In that
  case,</span> <span m='2938000'>a rotational quantum number. That is where we are
  going to</span> <span m='2944451'>pick up on Monday. See you then.</span> </p>
