  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>I didn't quite get a
  chance to tell you a few things about</span> <span m='19000'>photosystem II last
  time, so I am going to go ahead and</span> <span m='24000'>finish up with that now
  before going onto the Cardiolite story.</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>Photosystem
  II shares quite a lot in common with photosystem</span> <span m='33000'>I, but there
  are a few major differences.</span> </p><p><span m='36000'>Photosystem II is the
  first link in the chain of</span> <span m='38000'>photosynthesis. It is really where
  all</span> <span m='41000'>photosynthesis starts out on earth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='43000'>And, as such, it is an extraordinarily</span> <span m='45000'>important
  enzyme, this photosystem II.</span> </p><p><span m='47000'>But it is such a large
  and complicated enzyme.</span> </p><p><span m='50000'>And it is also a membrane
  enzyme.</span> </p><p><span m='52000'>As I mentioned last time, these are difficult
  to isolate</span> <span m='55000'>and purify and crystallize so that you can study
  their</span> <span m='58000'>structures. And it was only in the last</span> <span
  m='62000'>couple of years that photosystem II was actually</span> <span m='65000'>crystallographically
  characterized,</span> <span m='67000'>so there is really a lot of very recent science
  that is</span> <span m='71000'>relevant to today's presentation on photosystem II.</span>
  </p><p><span m='74000'>As you go through and read about it, you are going to learn</span>
  <span m='78000'>about the molecules that harvest the light, and you are going to</span>
  <span m='82000'>learn about where the electron goes and where the hole goes</span>
  <span m='86000'>when light is absorbed by this amazing system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90000'>Here is a close up of part of the system called the reaction</span> <span
  m='94000'>center, for obvious reasons. This where the reactions take</span> <span
  m='98000'>place that are so integral to photosynthesis.</span> </p><p><span m='101000'>Namely
  we have, up here at the top,</span> <span m='103000'>a manganese-containing cluster,
  the structure of which is still</span> <span m='107000'>a little bit ill-defined.
  As you can imagine,</span> <span m='110000'>with a macromolecule of this size, it
  is difficult to say</span> <span m='114000'>exactly where just each and every atom
  is in the structure.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>There are still some details
  of the structure,</span> <span m='123000'>of the manganese cluster, here, that are
  not known.</span> </p><p><span m='126000'>But, nonetheless, this is where two water</span>
  <span m='129000'>molecules must be brought in and coordinated and ultimately where</span>
  <span m='133000'>water, which is not a good reducing agent,</span> <span m='136000'>serves
  as a source of electrons in this system.</span> </p><p><span m='139000'>And what
  happens is this special pair of chlorophyll</span> <span m='142000'>molecules at
  the heart of the reaction center absorbs a photon</span> <span m='146000'>and goes
  into an excited state. And the electron is able to</span> <span m='151000'>travel
  down through a series of pigment molecules,</span> <span m='155000'>and it gets
  down onto this plastoquinone A.</span> </p><p><span m='158000'>And it is able to
  jump over onto the plastoquinone B.</span> </p><p><span m='161000'>And plastoquinone
  B then can dissociate from the reaction</span> <span m='165000'>center and carry
  that electron onto the next link in the chain</span> <span m='170000'>in photosynthesis.
  And, at the same time,</span> <span m='173000'>the hole is stuck back over here
  and ends up accepting an</span> <span m='176000'>electron by oxidation of a reduced
  tyrosine moiety here.</span> </p><p><span m='182000'>This tyrosine has a phenoxy
  residue.</span> </p><p><span m='184000'>It is connected to the amino acid polypeptide
  backbone of</span> <span m='188000'>this protein and it is positioned right here
  between</span> <span m='192000'>the manganese cluster and the special pair,</span>
  <span m='195000'>so that once the electron is shuttled away down this redox</span>
  <span m='199000'>cascade pathway, it is juxtaposed with this</span> <span m='203000'>reduced
  tyrosine, which is getting its electrons</span> <span m='206000'>from the water
  that is coordinated to the manganese</span> <span m='210000'>complex. And somehow
  those two water</span> <span m='213000'>molecules, after giving up their four electrons,</span>
  <span m='217000'>become O two. And O two gas bubbles out,</span> <span m='220000'>and
  that is the source of the oxygen that we breathe on this</span> <span m='224000'>planet.
  So this is, needless to say,</span> <span m='227000'>a very important enzyme to
  understand.</span> </p><p><span m='229000'>And I won't have time to go through an
  exploration of the</span> <span m='233000'>structure today, but I will lead you
  into it by</span> <span m='237000'>showing you this picture. And in this picture,</span>
  <span m='241000'>the sort of gray background that is mapped out here on the</span>
  <span m='245000'>outside represents this polypeptide chain,</span> <span m='248000'>all
  the amino acids that are linked together to form the</span> <span m='253000'>protein
  container of photosystem II.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>And you can see that
  it looks like a dimeric structure where</span> <span m='260000'>you have one reaction
  center over here, here is a special</span> <span m='264000'>pair located over there.
  And then all embedded</span> <span m='268000'>throughout this protein you find many,
  many cofactors which are</span> <span m='272000'>like porphyrins, but contain magnesium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='277000'>And there are these chlorophyll units.</span> </p><p><span
  m='279000'>And then also, shown in sort of an orange</span> <span m='281000'>color
  here, you see these long straight molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='285000'>These
  are polyenes. These are carotenoid molecules,</span> <span m='288000'>organic molecules
  that have strings of double bonds adjacent</span> <span m='292000'>to one other
  so that they can conduct electricity and conduct</span> <span m='295000'>energy.
  And this is a really key</span> <span m='297000'>feature of this -- -- because the
  point that is</span> <span m='301000'>being made here is that the photosynthesis
  does not wait</span> <span m='305000'>until a photon actually comes in and impinges
  right there on the</span> <span m='308000'>special pair. A photon can come in anywhere</span>
  <span m='311000'>on this big molecule or on these light harvesting proteins shown</span>
  <span m='315000'>at top and at bottom that come up and dock next to photosystem</span>
  <span m='318000'>II. And these light harvesting</span> <span m='320000'>proteins
  are also just chalk full of light absorbing</span> <span m='323000'>chromophores,
  chlorophylls,</span> <span m='325000'>and carotenoid molecules. And, if a photon
  comes in and</span> <span m='329000'>excites one of these molecules over here, the
  proton has a</span> <span m='333000'>mechanism for transmitting the energy over
  to the special pair,</span> <span m='338000'>so that water can be oxidized to O
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='341000'>It is really quite a tremendous assembly of
  different kinds of</span> <span m='345000'>molecules to perform function. And if
  you go on and take 5.03,</span> <span m='349000'>for example, and then 5.04,</span>
  <span m='351000'>you will learn about the rules that govern electron transfer</span>
  <span m='355000'>between molecules and also in proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='358000'>Let's
  see. Finally, on this subject,</span> <span m='361000'>I will show you, here, a
  view of this reaction</span> <span m='364000'>center. And this just a close-up to</span>
  <span m='366000'>show you that these water molecules indeed must get in</span> <span
  m='370000'>here. There is also a calcium ion</span> <span m='372000'>present at
  this active site, where the water molecules are</span> <span m='376000'>being oxidized
  and converted into dioxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='379000'>And here is that tyrosine
  residue shown in more detail.</span> </p><p><span m='382000'>That is very important
  for the hopping of the electron from</span> <span m='386000'>water to the tyrosine.
  And then over here,</span> <span m='390000'>after the hole has been generated through
  excitation of</span> <span m='393000'>the special pair of chlorophyll molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='396000'>And so that brings me to the end of my discussion of</span>
  <span m='399000'>six-metaloenzyme systems that had quite a bit in common in</span>
  <span m='403000'>terms of the ligands that are used to bind metals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='406000'>We talked about heme last time and its employment of the</span> <span
  m='410000'>porphyrin ligand in this regard. But then, you should also</span> <span
  m='414000'>remember that sometimes you see clusters packed into protein</span> <span
  m='418000'>molecules as cofactors. We saw last time some Fe four-S</span> <span
  m='423000'>four clusters, and here, a manganese cluster.</span> </p><p><span m='428000'>And
  so inorganic and organic molecules are all working</span> <span m='432000'>together
  in a beautiful synergy to enable photosynthesis.</span> </p><p><span m='437000'>And,
  having said that, I would like to now go onto my</span> <span m='441000'>final topic,
  which has to do with the role that metals can</span> <span m='445000'>play in medicine.
  Last time was metals in</span> <span m='449000'>biology. Now, we will talk about
  metals</span> <span m='453000'>in medicine. And there are different ways</span>
  <span m='455000'>that metals can be used in medicine.</span> </p><p><span m='458000'>For
  example, there are molecules like</span> <span m='460000'>cisplatin that are used
  in therapeutic methods for treating</span> <span m='464000'>cancer. Alternatively,</span>
  <span m='465000'>metals can be used in a diagnostic manner.</span> </p><p><span
  m='468000'>And that is what I will be talking about here today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='473000'>And so what I did for today was I went directly to a couple of</span>
  <span m='477000'>the Ph.D. theses that are in the MIT</span> <span m='480000'>digital
  archive by two students who worked in the Chemistry</span> <span m='484000'>Department
  here and earned their Ph.D.</span> </p><p><span m='487000'>theses doing the chemistry
  of technetium.</span> </p><p><span m='489000'>Now, I like technetium for a lot of
  reasons.</span> </p><p><span m='493000'>One, it is a neighbor element to molybdenum
  in the periodic</span> <span m='497000'>table. Number two, it is named after</span>
  <span m='499000'>MIT, so that is wonderful. Number three,</span> <span m='504000'>technetium
  is unique as an example, right in the center of</span> <span m='508000'>the periodic
  table, as a manmade element.</span> </p><p><span m='511000'>And it has been known
  for quite some time, and I am going to</span> <span m='516000'>tell you a little
  bit how technetium chemistry has evolved</span> <span m='521000'>in the MIT Chemistry
  Department. And so this first thesis is a</span> <span m='526000'>1983 thesis of
  a fellow by the name of Mike Abrams,</span> <span m='530000'>a very smart graduate
  student who was given a very difficult</span> <span m='535000'>research problem
  indeed for his Ph.D.</span> </p><p><span m='538000'>thesis. And that had to do with</span>
  <span m='542000'>preparing compounds directly from the pertechnetate ion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='547000'>And pertechnetate is the ion TcO four minus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='552000'>And, if you look through this, you will see why Mike Abrams</span> <span
  m='557000'>needed to prepare compounds directly from the pertechnetate</span> <span
  m='562000'>ion. And it has to do with the idea</span> <span m='565000'>that there
  is an isotope of technetium.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>An isotope known as
  technetium-99M,</span> <span m='572000'>M for metastable, that has a six hour half-life.</span>
  </p><p><span m='576000'>And, in that six hour time window that is the half-life
  of</span> <span m='581000'>technetium-99M, it is dropping from a nuclear</span>
  <span m='584000'>excited state into a nuclear ground state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='587000'>And I will talk more about that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='591000'>But
  as the nuclear excited state relaxes to the ground</span> <span m='595000'>state,
  this nucleus emits a single gamma photon at about</span> <span m='600000'>kiloelectron
  volts. And so that single gamma</span> <span m='604000'>photon, high energy photon,
  that comes out when this</span> <span m='608000'>nucleus decays from 99M to regular
  technetium-99,</span> <span m='611000'>which has a much longer half-life on the
  order of 10^5</span> <span m='615000'>years, is what is useful in a branch of medicine
  known as</span> <span m='619000'>nuclear medicine. So radiologists will be</span>
  <span m='622000'>interested in this. And, as you will see,</span> <span m='625000'>cardiologists
  will be interested in this as well.</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>And so, because
  of this, gamma camera images can be</span> <span m='633000'>obtained at high-resolution
  to image organs that have taken up</span> <span m='638000'>this radioisotope. Let's
  point out also,</span> <span m='641000'>here, that the chemical form of technetium
  obtained from the</span> <span m='646000'>generator that creates it is the pertechnetate
  ion,</span> <span m='650000'>so all radiopharmaceuticals have to be prepared from
  TcO</span> <span m='655000'>four minus because that is what you get.</span> </p><p><span
  m='660000'>Molybdenum-99 is a product of nuclear fission.</span> </p><p><span m='663000'>And
  so, when people are using nuclear reactors to make energy,</span> <span m='668000'>they
  are accumulating a lot of molybdenum-99.</span> </p><p><span m='672000'>And molybdenum-99
  is an unstable isotope of molybdenum,</span> <span m='677000'>and so it is right
  to the left of technetium on the periodic</span> <span m='682000'>table. And molybdenum-99
  itself</span> <span m='684000'>undergoes a beta decay, in which a neutron turns
  into a</span> <span m='689000'>proton and electron. And that beta decay converts</span>
  <span m='694000'>molybdenum-99 into this metastable isotope of</span> <span m='698000'>technetium.
  So what happens is that every</span> <span m='702000'>morning at the hospital, the
  molybdenum-99 has been</span> <span m='706000'>coated as MoO four onto an alumina
  column and is</span> <span m='711000'>undergoing its own beta decay. And when that
  is done,</span> <span m='716000'>you now have pertechnetate on the column.</span>
  </p><p><span m='721000'>And you can elute that in very dilute solution,</span> <span
  m='725000'>in isotonic saline solution. You then have a very small</span> <span
  m='730000'>amount of time to do chemistry with it before you put it in the</span>
  <span m='736000'>body. Therefore, Mike Abrams,</span> <span m='739000'>and I will
  tell you about the professors involved in this in a</span> <span m='744000'>little
  bit, was given the problem of finding a way to take</span> <span m='749000'>an extremely
  dilute solution on the order of 10^-9 molar</span> <span m='754000'>solution in
  saline and do a quantitative reaction from</span> <span m='758000'>pertechnetate
  to make something that would go and localize in an</span> <span m='763000'>organ
  that you want to image to find out about the patient's</span> <span m='768000'>health.
  That is a tall order,</span> <span m='771000'>but that didn't stop them from looking
  into this.</span> </p><p><span m='776000'>In fact, I included this page in part,
  because Mike Abrams has</span> <span m='782000'>some nice statements, here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='785000'>He says the reason we carried out this research was to gain
  a</span> <span m='788000'>better understanding of what kinds of coordination complexes</span>
  <span m='791000'>can be prepared directly from TcO four minus with</span> <span
  m='795000'>the hope that such information might lead to the development of</span>
  <span m='799000'>new radiopharmaceutical agents and/or to a better understanding</span>
  <span m='802000'>of the agents already in clinical use.</span> </p><p><span m='804918'>This
  thesis was written in</span> <span m='806000'>Well, let me not get ahead of myself
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>And let me just show you here one of the first
  technetium</span> <span m='814000'>complexes that Mike Abrams was able to prepare.</span>
  </p><p><span m='818000'>And this is a technetium hexacis thyourea species.</span>
  </p><p><span m='822000'>You will see that he has this pertechnetate and was able
  to</span> <span m='827000'>convert it into molecules that are octahedral at technetium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='832000'>And, in fact, most of the applications of</span> <span m='835000'>technetium
  in nuclear medicine do involve octahedral</span> <span m='839000'>six-coordinate
  technetium, --</span> <span m='843000'>-- harkening back to what we can understand
  based on the</span> <span m='847000'>efforts and achievements of Alfred Werner.</span>
  </p><p><span m='850000'>Here is the octahedron, pretty soon,</span> <span m='853000'>going
  to go into a patient's body.</span> </p><p><span m='855000'>Here he has chosen to
  use sulfur donor ligands,</span> <span m='859000'>these thiourea ligands in making
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='861000'>And he also made molecules in which phosphines
  and phosphites</span> <span m='866000'>were able to bind to technetium. And later,
  as you will see,</span> <span m='871000'>he also did work with isocyanides.</span>
  </p><p><span m='900000'>This is 90 degrees rotated. Basically, the reason I am</span>
  <span m='903000'>showing you this is that this is a nuclear magnetic resonance</span>
  <span m='907000'>spectrum of a technetium-99 compound.</span> </p><p><span m='909000'>Let
  me just explain that initially, when doing these</span> <span m='912000'>studies,
  Mike Abrams was working mostly with technetium-99 that</span> <span m='916000'>has
  the real long half-life so you can actually make molecules</span> <span m='920000'>on
  a scale sufficient for isolation and purification.</span> </p><p><span m='925000'>But
  then those methods would be translated to working with the</span> <span m='930000'>99M
  isotope. And the difference between 99</span> <span m='934000'>and 99M, has to do
  with the spin of the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='938000'>We have talked about
  electron spin.</span> </p><p><span m='941000'>Well, different nuclei have themselves
  the property of spin.</span> </p><p><span m='946000'>And technetium-99 has a spin
  one-half nuclear spin.</span> </p><p><span m='951000'>And then when it decays from
  99M to 99, the 99 isotope has a</span> <span m='956000'>spin nine-halves, actually.</span>
  </p><p><span m='960000'>And that is the lower energy state that gives rise to this</span>
  <span m='964000'>gamma photon emission. And so, in the nuclear magnetic</span> <span
  m='968000'>resonance spectrum, observing the phosphorus 31</span> <span m='971000'>nuclei
  that are connected to this hexakisphosphate of</span> <span m='975000'>technetium
  1, you see that there end up being</span> <span m='978000'>ten lines. And that is
  because of the spin</span> <span m='982000'>nine-halves ground state of the technetium-99
  nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='987000'>You will see that back in the `80s, we were
  looking at</span> <span m='990000'>technetium-coupled phosphorus NMR spectra, as
  well as,</span> <span m='994000'>you saw X-ray crystallography a moment ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='997000'>This was real nice work. And let's see what I have here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1001000'>After Mike had successfully synthesized some of these</span>
  <span m='1005000'>complexes they started wondering, well,</span> <span m='1008000'>can
  we image organs with these. The idea was that</span> <span m='1011000'>radiopharmaceuticals
  that had been in use prior to this time</span> <span m='1015000'>did not really
  have ligands on the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>It was sort of the case
  that they would take the metal in</span> <span m='1023000'>whatever form they got
  it off a generator and just inject it</span> <span m='1026000'>directly into the
  patient. And, in that case,</span> <span m='1029000'>you don't have an ability to
  tune the properties of the metal</span> <span m='1032000'>to have it localize specifically
  at organs that you might want to</span> <span m='1036000'>image. And so they thought
  we are</span> <span m='1038000'>coordination chemists. Let's put ligands on there,</span>
  <span m='1040000'>and you can use different ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='1042000'>And
  then, the molecule will go to different parts of the body</span> <span m='1046000'>specifically.
  And, when we find the right</span> <span m='1049000'>ligand, we will be able to
  do something useful,</span> <span m='1052000'>like image the heart. And so here,</span>
  <span m='1054000'>they had an anesthetized dog that they had injected with a</span>
  <span m='1058000'>solution of one of these technetium complexes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1061000'>This was a hexakis isobutyl isocyanide technetium-99M.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1064000'>And they were able to show that this stuff forms quantitatively,</span>
  <span m='1068000'>even at the tracer levels that they are using to 10^-9 molar.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1072000'>Very dilute solutions. And so you don't actually get</span>
  <span m='1076000'>much radioactivity put into you, but because of the high energy</span>
  <span m='1080000'>nature of the gamma photons that come out, you can easily image</span>
  <span m='1084000'>them with a gamma camera and you can reconstruct the position</span>
  <span m='1087000'>from which that radiation is originating.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1090000'>That is what allows you to image an organ.</span> </p><p><span m='1092000'>And
  so here is a little schematic of the ribcage of a</span> <span m='1095000'>dog.
  And you can see that he is</span> <span m='1097000'>telling us where the liver is.
  And then you are supposed to be</span> <span m='1101000'>able to see kind of a doughnut,
  which is the myocardium of the</span> <span m='1105000'>heart here. And you see
  it lighting up real</span> <span m='1108000'>nice, right here. So right away,</span>
  <span m='1110000'>with one of the first complexes that they made,</span> <span m='1113000'>they
  found that this stuff goes shortly after injection and</span> <span m='1117000'>localizes
  in the heart and gives you a pretty nice image of the</span> <span m='1120000'>heart.
  And there are different</span> <span m='1122000'>viewpoints that you can take when
  you image the heart using</span> <span m='1126000'>methods like this, but this was
  already pretty</span> <span m='1129000'>exciting that one of the first systems they
  made,</span> <span m='1132000'>these t-butyl groups on it, were very nice imaging
  agents</span> <span m='1135000'>for a dog. And then the basis for the</span> <span
  m='1139000'>nuclear cardiology application of this chemistry is that if a</span>
  <span m='1143000'>person has had a heart attack or is at-risk to suffer a heart</span>
  <span m='1147000'>attack, has some heart disease, then what happens is you look</span>
  <span m='1150000'>at the heart and it doesn't become very well-perfused with</span>
  <span m='1154000'>blood all the way around, as it should in a normal</span> <span
  m='1157000'>healthy heart. And so, if there is infarcted</span> <span m='1160000'>tissue,
  you see an image like this, where part of the doughnut</span> <span m='1163000'>is
  not lighting up. And that means that part of the</span> <span m='1168000'>heart
  is not getting suffused with blood.</span> </p><p><span m='1171000'>And so this
  kind of diagnostic test is called myocardial</span> <span m='1175000'>perfusion
  imaging, because you are looking at how</span> <span m='1178000'>the heart is taking
  up blood in all of its different parts</span> <span m='1182000'>because you can
  look at different angles of view.</span> </p><p><span m='1186000'>And one also tends
  to do this when the subject is at rest</span> <span m='1190000'>versus when the
  subject has been stressed.</span> </p><p><span m='1193000'>So you will hear the
  term stress test associated with this</span> <span m='1197000'>type of image. And
  so this is really the first</span> <span m='1202000'>complex that Mike Abrams made
  that they were actually testing</span> <span m='1205000'>in animals. Here was an
  infarcted dog</span> <span m='1208000'>heart. You see that there is blood not</span>
  <span m='1210000'>getting to this part of the heart, up here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1213000'>And this image was to be compared with an image made</span> <span m='1216000'>using
  a different imaging agent which was the state of the art</span> <span m='1220000'>at
  the time, here, with just the first one.</span> </p><p><span m='1223000'>And there
  were so many choices you could make of what ligand to</span> <span m='1227000'>put
  on this metal. And the first one already works</span> <span m='1232000'>better than
  thallium-201 that is inserted just as an aqueous</span> <span m='1236000'>solution.
  So thallium-201 is also a</span> <span m='1238000'>popular isotope for applications
  in nuclear medicine,</span> <span m='1241000'>but with technetium, now, you have
  the ability to</span> <span m='1244000'>make coordination compounds where the ligands
  are very</span> <span m='1248000'>tightly bonded to the metal center.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1250000'>And then you can attach other residues to this system by</span> <span
  m='1254000'>virtue of how you build the ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='1256000'>That
  was really pretty amazing. And then a few years later,</span> <span m='1261000'>also
  in the research group of Alan Davison,</span> <span m='1264000'>Professor of Chemistry
  at MIT, comes along one James Frederick</span> <span m='1269000'>Carnegie. And what
  he decided to do for</span> <span m='1271000'>his thesis work was to go ahead and
  actually make molecules like</span> <span m='1276000'>the ones that Mike Abrams
  made, but to look at many different</span> <span m='1280000'>varieties with different
  peripheral substituents because</span> <span m='1284000'>there are certain organic
  functional groups that will be</span> <span m='1288000'>metabolized and chopped
  up by enzymes in the body.</span> </p><p><span m='1293000'>These include ester groups,
  for example.</span> </p><p><span m='1296000'>You can also attach to these isocyanide
  ligands things that</span> <span m='1300000'>look like little proteins. And you
  can see,</span> <span m='1304000'>then, how those react to being injected.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1307000'>And so his goal here was really to make something practical
  that</span> <span m='1312000'>would be useful as a radiopharmaceutical for imaging</span>
  <span m='1316000'>organs. And his discussion begins by</span> <span m='1320000'>just
  talking about the different groups that he was going to</span> <span m='1324000'>append
  to the surface of his coordination complex.</span> </p><p><span m='1328000'>And
  then, here is a little synthesis slide from his thesis.</span> </p><p><span m='1332000'>Mike
  Abram's thesis, the first one I showed you,</span> <span m='1335000'>was actually
  typed up by hand on a typewriter.</span> </p><p><span m='1339000'>But Jim Carnegie's
  thesis was prepared, he tells me,</span> <span m='1342000'>I was talking to him
  last night about this, using a very</span> <span m='1347000'>primitive word processor.
  One of the first-generation</span> <span m='1351000'>word processors. Anyway, that
  is a little bit</span> <span m='1354000'>beside the point. You just don't see as
  many nice</span> <span m='1358000'>graphics in these theses as you do nowadays,
  but you do see a</span> <span m='1362000'>lot of beautiful chemistry. Here is an
  isocyanide ligand.</span> </p><p><span m='1366000'>Look. We have talked a lot about</span>
  <span m='1368000'>carbon monoxide in this class as a ligand in its behavior to</span>
  <span m='1372000'>transition metals. And so if you just change the</span> <span
  m='1375000'>oxygen of carbon monoxide into a nitrogen, then you can have a</span>
  <span m='1380000'>substituent stuck to it. Here is an example of an</span> <span
  m='1384000'>isocyanide ligand where the metal is going to attach to the</span> <span
  m='1388000'>carbon. And then, Carnegie decided to</span> <span m='1391000'>put other
  groups out here. Here, he has a carboethoxy</span> <span m='1394000'>residue. And
  the idea was that enzymes</span> <span m='1397000'>called esterases in the body
  can clip off and metabolize the</span> <span m='1401000'>carboethoxy residue. And
  what that will do is it</span> <span m='1404000'>will affect the way that the technetium
  is bio-distributed in</span> <span m='1408000'>the body. It will affect the kinetics
  of</span> <span m='1412000'>how long the technetium takes to accumulate in an organ
  and how</span> <span m='1417000'>long it takes to then run out of that organ.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1420000'>And also, he looked at examples that have organic amide</span>
  <span m='1425000'>functional groups, all connected to the</span> <span m='1428000'>isocyanide.
  His thesis work was all about</span> <span m='1431000'>looking at different isocyanides,
  six of them on</span> <span m='1435000'>technetium in the +1 oxidation state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1439000'>It is d^6 low-spin octahedral diamagnetic systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1442000'>It talks here about the radioactivity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1444000'>It talks a little bit about the technetium generator issue.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1448000'>It mentions that he is doing a lot of this work in</span> <span m='1451000'>collaboration
  over at Harvard Medical School.</span> </p><p><span m='1454000'>They had a lab over
  there where they were cleared to use 99M.</span> </p><p><span m='1458000'>The 99
  work was done here, at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='1460000'>And this was because
  of the collaboration that I will tell</span> <span m='1464000'>you about shortly.
  Here is one that I won't bother</span> <span m='1467000'>to turn over. But this
  actually a pretty</span> <span m='1472000'>important slide. You will get this pdf
  file from</span> <span m='1476000'>our website, but you will see that he is taking
  pertechnetate</span> <span m='1481000'>and saline. The key feature,</span> <span
  m='1484000'>here, is that this synthesis is quantitative at these very low</span>
  <span m='1489000'>concentrations that are what used for nuclear medicine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1494000'>Now, I showed you that Mike Abrams imaged part of a dog.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1500000'>And as they progressed toward doing human studies,</span>
  <span m='1503000'>they also imaged the rabbit. And in these early tests,</span>
  <span m='1506000'>you know, you have these chemistry Ph.D.</span> </p><p><span m='1509000'>students
  who don't really know which organ is which in a bunny.</span> </p><p><span m='1513000'>They
  had to get a diagram like this, out so they would have a</span> <span m='1516000'>map,
  so that when they started shooting these molecules into</span> <span m='1520000'>the
  bunny they would know which organ they were seeing light up</span> <span m='1524000'>by
  the gamma camera. And this does not hurt the</span> <span m='1527000'>bunny. The
  bunny is anesthetized and</span> <span m='1531000'>does not know, so this is a perfectly
  nice</span> <span m='1533000'>thing to do. And this one,</span> <span m='1535000'>I
  think the bunny is oriented this way, here is the liver.</span> </p><p><span m='1539000'>And
  resting atop the liver on the diaphragm is the heart of</span> <span m='1543000'>the
  bunny right here. He has a lot of different</span> <span m='1546000'>images. These,
  in the digital thesis</span> <span m='1549000'>archive, are a little bit fuzzy.
  If you want to see better</span> <span m='1553000'>images, you might want to refer
  directly to the thesis.</span> </p><p><span m='1558000'>But you will see that what
  he is doing here is he is looking</span> <span m='1561000'>as a function of time
  after injection, just the intensity of</span> <span m='1565000'>the gamma counts
  from the liver, from the kidney.</span> </p><p><span m='1568000'>Notice the heart
  starts out real high, and then it clears as</span> <span m='1571000'>the blood moves
  on into the kidney and the liver.</span> </p><p><span m='1574000'>And so you can
  actually take these images as a function of</span> <span m='1578000'>time and see
  where the technetium is going in this</span> <span m='1581000'>living bunny. And
  I thought I would mention</span> <span m='1583000'>that. But then, I thought I would</span>
  <span m='1586000'>also show you this picture. I have seen this in the real</span>
  <span m='1590000'>hard copy thesis, and it looks much better in</span> <span m='1592000'>terms
  of organs lighting up and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='1595000'>It is very fuzzy
  in this image from Carnegie's Ph.D.</span> </p><p><span m='1598000'>thesis. This,
  in fact,</span> <span m='1599000'>is Professor Alan Davison, who was himself the
  first test</span> <span m='1603000'>subject for his technetium radiopharmaceutical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1606000'>He just couldn't wait to have this stuff shot into him,</span>
  <span m='1609000'>so he could see what his organs looked like when imaged with a</span>
  <span m='1613000'>gamma camera. That is Professor Davison,</span> <span m='1615000'>first
  human test subject on his own chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>That was
  pretty remarkable. Let me tell you just a little</span> <span m='1624000'>bit more
  about Alan Davison. You can go and read about him</span> <span m='1629000'>at the
  MIT website, but this is Professor Davison.</span> </p><p><span m='1633000'>He is
  a colleague of mine in inorganic chemistry,</span> <span m='1637000'>here at MIT.
  He became an emeritus faculty</span> <span m='1641000'>member this past summer,
  but his research career spanned</span> <span m='1645000'>40 years here at MIT. He
  came in 1964.</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>And he did research in a lot of different
  areas of inorganic</span> <span m='1653000'>chemistry, and did not get into technetium
  until 1980 because he</span> <span m='1657000'>struck up a collaboration with the
  fellow at Harvard Medical</span> <span m='1661000'>School, who I will show you next.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1663000'>He is a Welshman. He got his Ph.D.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1666000'>with the Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Wilkinson at Imperial</span> <span
  m='1669000'>College, London, after Jeff Wilkinson was denied</span> <span m='1672000'>tenure
  by Harvard, after which he got his Nobel</span> <span m='1675000'>Prize. They did
  not make a very good</span> <span m='1677000'>choice, there. But, in any event,</span>
  <span m='1681000'>Professor Davison learned and became one of the top inorganic</span>
  <span m='1685000'>and organometallic chemists of his generation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1688000'>And, in fact, he is now a Fellow of the Royal</span> <span m='1691000'>Society,
  which is quite a special distinction.</span> </p><p><span m='1694000'>I went over
  there for the ceremony in London when he was</span> <span m='1697000'>being inducted
  into the Royal Society.</span> </p><p><span m='1700000'>And they pull out the book
  that is signed by all the new</span> <span m='1704000'>inductees into the Royal
  Society.</span> </p><p><span m='1706000'>And one of the early signatures in the
  book is that of Isaac</span> <span m='1710000'>Newton. So he signed the same book
  as</span> <span m='1713000'>Isaac Newton. You have to make sure your hand</span>
  <span m='1716000'>does not tremble and blot the page.</span> </p><p><span m='1719000'>It
  would be a big problem. They actually go ahead and</span> <span m='1722000'>teach
  them how to sign the book and practice in advance because</span> <span m='1727000'>they
  use a quill pen dipped into ink, just the way Isaac Newton</span> <span m='1731000'>did
  it. And this coming spring,</span> <span m='1733000'>Professor Davison is going
  to Atlanta, as many of us chemists</span> <span m='1737000'>are, for the American
  Chemical Society meeting there.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>But he is going
  for a special reason.</span> </p><p><span m='1744000'>He is winning the American
  Chemical Society Award for</span> <span m='1747000'>Creative Invention, which is
  a very prestigious</span> <span m='1750000'>award. And I believe he is the first</span>
  <span m='1752000'>from our department ever to win the Award for Creative</span>
  <span m='1756000'>Invention. And that can go to a person in</span> <span m='1758000'>any
  area of chemistry, in fact.</span> </p><p><span m='1760000'>That is a really nice
  thing. And Professor Davison was a</span> <span m='1764000'>great mentor of both
  undergraduate and graduate</span> <span m='1767000'>students here at MIT over the
  years.</span> </p><p><span m='1771000'>And next let me show you that it takes not
  one Welshman,</span> <span m='1775000'>but two, to make a drug. And here is the
  other one,</span> <span m='1779000'>Alan Jones, a very good personal friend of Alan
  Davison.</span> </p><p><span m='1783000'>He and Alan got together in the early `80s
  to see if they might</span> <span m='1788000'>not be able to bring inorganic chemistry
  and coordination</span> <span m='1793000'>chemistry to nuclear medicine in order
  to develop a diagnostic</span> <span m='1797000'>imaging agent. They got together,</span>
  <span m='1801000'>and their research was extremely successful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1804000'>And they have done research in other areas, too,</span> <span m='1808000'>together
  over the years. And their students go back and</span> <span m='1812000'>forth between
  the labs here and Building 6 at MIT and over at</span> <span m='1817000'>Harvard
  Medical School to do the different kinds of studies that</span> <span m='1822000'>they
  do. It turns out that his</span> <span m='1824000'>chemistry, making these six-coordinate
  complexes of</span> <span m='1828000'>technetium-1, has led to the development of</span>
  <span m='1831000'>Cardiolite. This now is called Sestamibi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1836000'>That is an abbreviation for this compound that has six of</span> <span
  m='1841000'>these isocyanide ligands on technetium.</span> </p><p><span m='1844000'>When
  you see Sestamibi, you will know what molecule</span> <span m='1848000'>that is.
  It is the one that actually</span> <span m='1851000'>became commercial and was approved
  by the FDA in</span> <span m='1856000'>after extensive critical trials. I will show
  you the structure</span> <span m='1862000'>in a moment, but it is a variation on
  the t-butyl,</span> <span m='1866000'>where one of the methyl groups is replaced
  with a methoxy</span> <span m='1871000'>group. It is a methyl-ether species.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1874000'>And Cardiolite was originally manufactured and brought
  into</span> <span m='1879000'>being by DuPont Merck. And they sold it later to</span>
  <span m='1883000'>Bristol-Meyers Squibb. And so you will see that</span> <span m='1887000'>Bristol-Meyers
  Squibb has a section devoted to medical</span> <span m='1892000'>imaging. And this
  drug that was the</span> <span m='1896000'>brainchild of Davison and Jones is currently
  the most widely</span> <span m='1901000'>used diagnostic imaging agent for looking
  at myocardial</span> <span m='1906000'>perfusion. It is used in heart imaging</span>
  <span m='1909000'>tests all around the world, every day, so it is a very</span>
  <span m='1914000'>important molecule contributing to the health and welfare of</span>
  <span m='1919000'>people all over the world. And what you will see is there</span>
  <span m='1925000'>are here descriptions of the stress tests that people take.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1929000'>Let's see. Cardiolite imaging guide.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1932000'>You have education programs. Let's just check out the</span> <span m='1936000'>imaging
  guide for a moment. These companies have pretty</span> <span m='1940000'>good graphics
  on their websites. And remember the doughnut I was</span> <span m='1945000'>showing
  you, there it is right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1949000'>There are different
  ways to look at the heart using</span> <span m='1952000'>Cardiolite to see if the
  blood is perfusing the heart properly.</span> </p><p><span m='1957000'>That might
  be the short axis. You can view the scan images.</span> </p><p><span m='1961000'>This
  is how a normal healthy heart will differ when it has</span> <span m='1965000'>been
  stressed after exercise or at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='1968000'>That is why
  they call these stress tests.</span> </p><p><span m='1971000'>You are seeing how
  the blood is distributed in the heart using</span> <span m='1975000'>the property
  of the radionuclide technetium-99M.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>There is one.
  That is a different one.</span> </p><p><span m='1982000'>I am not going to spend
  too much time on this,</span> <span m='1985000'>but I am giving you the link to
  this website so you can go and</span> <span m='1989000'>look at how people actually
  use clinically technetium Sestamibi</span> <span m='1994000'>to image the heart.
  I want to show you just a few</span> <span m='1997000'>other things here, one of
  which is that,</span> <span m='2000000'>as you may be aware, the same molecule can
  have</span> <span m='2003000'>different names if it is used for different purposes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2008000'>Cardiolite is one of the names given to Sestamibi,</span>
  <span m='2012000'>but another name given to Sestamibi, here it is,</span> <span
  m='2016000'>is Miraluma. And Miraluma,</span> <span m='2018000'>it turns out, is
  really quite useful at</span> <span m='2021000'>detecting breast cancer when breast
  lesions are not readily</span> <span m='2026000'>visible using mammography or ultrasound.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2029000'>If you go to this website and look at the information for</span>
  <span m='2034000'>healthcare professionals, as you all are sitting here,</span>
  <span m='2039000'>you will be able to see breast tumors that are detected very</span>
  <span m='2044000'>nicely using Sestamibi that were missed using ultrasound or</span>
  <span m='2049000'>mammography. And you might like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2053000'>If
  you try to go into that information, you're first</span> <span m='2057000'>confronted
  with a test. And you have to pass the test</span> <span m='2061000'>and know that
  the risk of breast cancer increases with age.</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>If
  you get that right, then you can go on and actually</span> <span m='2070000'>look
  at the images that are made using this drug.</span> </p><p><span m='2075000'>Now,
  I also give you a link here to the Cardiolite story</span> <span m='2079000'>that
  is a nice article written in the MIT Undergraduate</span> <span m='2083000'>Research
  Journal about Professors Davison and Jones,</span> <span m='2087000'>their students,
  and the creation of this</span> <span m='2090000'>clinical tool. You can go there
  and read that.</span> </p><p><span m='2094000'>And it has some more information.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2096000'>And then, finally, I do give you a link to</span> <span
  m='2100000'>Sestamibi. You will probably be appalled</span> <span m='2103000'>at
  the way this website draws the isocyanide complex of</span> <span m='2107000'>technetium.
  We know very well that that is</span> <span m='2109000'>a linear bond angle at those
  carbon atoms,</span> <span m='2112000'>not bent like that, so that is not a very
  good</span> <span m='2115000'>representation in terms of structural fidelity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2118000'>But if you want to know which isocyanide is used in vivo
  for</span> <span m='2122000'>imaging organs, it is this one with the methoxy</span>
  <span m='2124000'>group, instead of one of the methyl groups of the t-butyl</span>
  <span m='2128000'>group. It is very similar to the</span> <span m='2131000'>original
  one that Mike Abrams made first back in 1983 because</span> <span m='2136000'>they
  already had t-butyl isocyanide around from other</span> <span m='2140000'>things.
  It is a really remarkable</span> <span m='2143000'>story, a fantastic story. And
  having told it to you,</span> <span m='2147000'>I am now going to have to do something
  that I very much</span> <span m='2151000'>regret. Now you can go on and sample</span>
  <span m='2154000'>all the other exciting chemistry subjects at MIT in your future.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2160000'>I hope to interact with many of you again in that context.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2164000'>And I wish you good luck. I know that you all will do</span>
  <span m='2168000'>fantastic things. Having said that,</span> <span m='2171000'>I
  am going to have to close the book on this semester.</span> </p><p><span m='2175429'>[APPLAUSE]</span>
