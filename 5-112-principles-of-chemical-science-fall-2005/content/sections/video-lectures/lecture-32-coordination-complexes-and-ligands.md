  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>We have been talking
  about the properties of transition metal</span> <span m='19000'>complexes, coordination
  complexes, in the context of a</span> <span m='24000'>simple crystal field theory
  model.</span> </p><p><span m='27000'>And I just wanted to make reference at the
  beginning,</span> <span m='31000'>today, to state diagrams.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40000'>And, in the context of octahedral complexes,</span> <span m='43000'>you
  saw that an array of six ligands surrounding a central</span> <span m='49000'>metal
  ion would lead to a t two g and what we are</span> <span m='54000'>calling an eg
  star manifold of orbitals on the</span> <span m='59000'>metal in which we can populate
  with the number of d electrons</span> <span m='65000'>that we have present. And
  the graph that I am making</span> <span m='70000'>here is related to the idea that
  for a system with only a single</span> <span m='77000'>electron, so this could be,
  for example,</span> <span m='80000'>titanium OH two six times three plus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86000'>This is a d one system. And it can go from a ground</span>
  <span m='92000'>state configuration of t two g one eg star zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='97000'>And then, upon absorption of</span> <span m='100000'>light, it can be
  promoted from the ground state,</span> <span m='104000'>represented here, into the
  excited state.</span> </p><p><span m='108000'>And the excited state has the configuration
  t two g zero eg</span> <span m='113000'>star one, showing that that electron has</span>
  <span m='118000'>been promoted through absorption of a photon.</span> </p><p><span
  m='124000'>And this gap here between t(2g) and eg star,</span> <span m='129000'>of
  course, is our delta O value.</span> </p><p><span m='132000'>And the axis on the
  bottom, here, is ligand field strength.</span> </p><p><span m='150000'>This is supposed
  to tell you that different ligands give rise</span> <span m='154000'>to different
  values of delta O accounting for the fact that</span> <span m='159000'>this d one
  titanium three ion in a field</span> <span m='164000'>of water molecules has one
  color, whereas,</span> <span m='167000'>if you, in fact, look at Ti Cl six three
  minus,</span> <span m='171000'>you will be able to tell that</span> <span m='175000'>that
  also is a titanium three plus or d one</span> <span m='179000'>system. But they
  do not have the same</span> <span m='184000'>color. And the one absorption band</span>
  <span m='187000'>that you find in the visible part of the spectrum that</span> <span
  m='191000'>corresponds to promotion of an electron from t two g</span> <span m='196000'>into
  eg star is just moving around a little bit in</span> <span m='201000'>energy because
  these ligands behave differently with respect</span> <span m='206000'>to what we
  call their ligand field strength that they exert,</span> <span m='210000'>that leads
  to a particular energy gap between t(2g) and</span> <span m='215000'>e(g)*. I will
  get into this a little</span> <span m='220000'>bit further in the moment, but the
  point here is that d</span> <span m='226000'>one or d nine are special electron
  counts.</span> </p><p><span m='245000'>And the reason that they are special is that
  these have a</span> <span m='250000'>single absorption peak due to what we call
  d-d transitions.</span> </p><p><span m='256000'>They have a single d-d transition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='265000'>And that means there is a ground state and then just one</span>
  <span m='269000'>excited state that the system can be promoted to in the</span>
  <span m='273000'>presence of impinging photons of the right energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='277000'>And what happens is that if you have more d electrons than just</span>
  <span m='282000'>one, or d nine is special because we treat that</span> <span m='287000'>using
  a whole formalism, like there is just one electron</span> <span m='291000'>missing
  from a complete manifold, a completely full d</span> <span m='295000'>shell minus
  one. With d^n systems,</span> <span m='299000'>for example, d two is much more</span>
  <span m='302000'>complex. And this is beyond the scope of</span> <span m='305000'>5.112,
  but it is something that they are treating in 5.04,</span> <span m='310000'>for
  example. If you go on in organic</span> <span m='313000'>chemistry, you will learn
  how come different states can arise,</span> <span m='318000'>multiple states arise
  when you have more than just a one</span> <span m='322000'>electron picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='330000'>For example, if you have a vanadium three</span> <span m='334000'>plus
  ion, there are three bands observed.</span> </p><p><span m='345000'>And so the simple
  picture that you have, just a t(2g) level and</span> <span m='348000'>an e(g) level
  is correct and maps onto the picture of the</span> <span m='352000'>electronic states
  that are available, as long as we are</span> <span m='355000'>just talking about
  a one electron picture.</span> </p><p><span m='359000'>With more electrons in play,
  depending on just which of the</span> <span m='362000'>orbitals they go into, they
  will have inter-electron</span> <span m='366000'>repulsion terms that come into
  play and give rise to more</span> <span m='369000'>excited states. Here, with three
  bands being</span> <span m='372000'>observed in the visible, that means there are
  three</span> <span m='375000'>possible transitions and three possible excited states
  that can</span> <span m='379000'>be accessed. So it is a very complicated</span>
  <span m='382000'>picture. And so we are going to be,</span> <span m='385000'>for
  the purposes of this, focusing on the one electron</span> <span m='388000'>picture.
  But I just wanted you to be</span> <span m='391000'>aware that it does get a lot
  more complex as soon as you go</span> <span m='394000'>to many electron systems.
  Now, let's talk just briefly</span> <span m='398000'>about pairing energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='408000'>In the case of 3d system, we typically find that the</span>
  <span m='413000'>pairing energy is around 15 to 18,000 reciprocal</span> <span m='421000'>centimeters,
  the typical energy unit given for pairing energy.</span> </p><p><span m='429000'>But
  then if we go to heavier transition elements,</span> <span m='433000'>to the 4d
  or the 5d elements, then typically the pairing</span> <span m='439000'>energy is
  about 8,000 to 12 reciprocal centimeters.</span> </p><p><span m='445000'>And what
  that says is that it is easier to pair up electrons</span> <span m='451000'>in 4d
  or 5d orbitals than it is to put two electrons in the same</span> <span m='457000'>3d
  orbital. And the reason for that is just</span> <span m='462000'>what the radial
  extension is of these orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='466000'>In effect, these
  orbitals are larger than the 3d orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='470000'>And it
  means that if you put two electrons into the same 4d</span> <span m='475000'>or
  5d orbital, much of the time they can stay</span> <span m='479000'>farther apart
  from each other than if they are in a 3d</span> <span m='483000'>orbital. And so
  this has the practical</span> <span m='487000'>consequence that 4d and 5d systems
  often are low spin.</span> </p><p><span m='493000'>And so this high spin/low spin
  issue that we talked about last</span> <span m='499000'>time is mostly focused on
  complexes of the 3d ions.</span> </p><p><span m='504000'>So then we are talking
  about titanium, vanadium,</span> <span m='508000'>chromium, etc. And, if we come
  over here,</span> <span m='513000'>we can ask, what is the effect of charge on delta
  O?</span> </p><p><span m='518000'>This is all pointing back to the state diagram
  that I showed</span> <span m='525000'>you over there in this kind of sliding scale,</span>
  <span m='529000'>where you can change things like just what type of metal ion</span>
  <span m='535000'>you have, 3d, 4d, or 5d.</span> </p><p><span m='539000'>Or you
  can change the nature of the ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='543000'>Or you can
  even change the charge on the metal as a way of</span> <span m='549000'>changing
  delta O. And so we can look at,</span> <span m='553000'>for example, chromium hexaaquo
  two plus</span> <span m='557000'>versus chromium hexaaquo three plus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='563000'>The first is a d four ion.</span> </p><p><span m='568000'>And then, the
  second is a d</span> <span m='572000'>three ion. You should practice going from</span>
  <span m='578000'>a formula into the d^n count. And then we can look at what</span>
  <span m='584000'>delta O does. This is roughly 14,000 wave</span> <span m='588000'>numbers.
  And then, when we oxidize from</span> <span m='592000'>2+ to 3+, higher charge on
  the central metal,</span> <span m='597000'>delta O shoots up to about approximately
  17,000.</span> </p><p><span m='604000'>And this is in reciprocal centimeters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='607000'>We see that putting a higher charge on the metal center
  leads</span> <span m='613000'>to a larger value of delta O. And that is also true
  if we</span> <span m='618000'>look at some other metal systems along these lines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='623000'>For example, there are just a number of</span> <span m='627000'>different
  metals for which the hexaaquo systems can be</span> <span m='632000'>generated in
  both the 2+ and the 3+ state of charge.</span> </p><p><span m='639000'>And here,
  we go from about 12,000 and then oxidize,</span> <span m='645000'>and we get up
  to about 18,000, so even a larger increase in</span> <span m='652000'>the value
  of delta O on going from the 2+ to the 3+ oxidation</span> <span m='659000'>state
  of the metal. And then in the notes you will</span> <span m='665000'>find that I
  put in another example that behaves similarly</span> <span m='670000'>based on cobalt.
  If you go from cobalt two to</span> <span m='673000'>cobalt three hexaaquo, you
  go from about 9,000 up to</span> <span m='677000'>18,000 reciprocal centimeters.
  So almost doubling the value of</span> <span m='682000'>delta O by removing one
  electron from the system.</span> </p><p><span m='686000'>What is going on here is
  that the greater charge --</span> <span m='697000'>-- pulls the ligands in closer
  to the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='708000'>And if the ligands are in closer to
  the metal,</span> <span m='711000'>then what that ends up saying is you will see
  in a moment</span> <span m='714000'>because we are going to get to the MO picture
  for octahedral</span> <span m='718000'>coordination complexes, is that putting electrons
  in e</span> <span m='722000'>g star becomes more difficult.</span> </p><p><span
  m='726000'>Delta O is larger. The ligands come in closer,</span> <span m='729000'>and
  that is effectively shrinking that value of r when</span> <span m='732000'>we talked
  about our spherical coordinates as applied to the</span> <span m='736000'>angular
  parts of the d-orbital wavefunctions and looking at</span> <span m='740000'>that.
  So we are changing r.</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>The ligands are coming in closer
  to the more positively</span> <span m='746000'>charged metal ion in that case. And
  then we can also look at</span> <span m='751000'>the effect of changing the ligand.</span>
  </p><p><span m='768000'>In the system on the left, we were looking at pairs of</span>
  <span m='771000'>metal complexes with the same ligand and changing the charge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='775000'>And now we are just going to say, what happens if you change</span>
  <span m='779000'>the ligand? And this will be a series of</span> <span m='784000'>vanadium
  complexes. We have five of them.</span> </p><p><span m='788000'>We have the vanadium
  hexaaquo.</span> </p><p><span m='796000'>This one is 3+. We have the vanadium with
  six</span> <span m='801000'>urea molecules. And this is also 3+.</span> </p><p><span
  m='806000'>We have vanadium hexafluoride three minus.</span> </p><p><span m='815000'>And
  these are all vanadium in the +3 oxidation state.</span> </p><p><span m='820000'>Then
  we have vanadium hexachloride three minus,</span> <span m='824000'>and down here
  the fifth one</span> <span m='829000'>will be vanadium with six cyanide ligands
  and three minus.</span> </p><p><span m='834000'>So these are all d two</span> <span
  m='839000'>systems with vanadium in the +3 oxidation state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='845000'>And here, we are going from 18,000 reciprocal centimeters to</span> <span
  m='852000'>the hexafluoride. And we drop down to 16,000.</span> </p><p><span m='858000'>And
  this is all approximate. And six urea on vanadium,</span> <span m='865000'>we go
  up to about 17,0000. And then, with the</span> <span m='871000'>hexachloride, we
  are down to about a delta O</span> <span m='875000'>of 12,000 reciprocal centimeters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='877000'>And then we put cyanides on, and delta O pops up to about</span>
  <span m='882000'>23,000 wave numbers. So this is the same metal ion</span> <span
  m='886000'>but in five different ligand environments.</span> </p><p><span m='890000'>It
  has five very different values of delta O.</span> </p><p><span m='894000'>And from
  this, we can derive a spectrochemical</span> <span m='897000'>series --</span> <span
  m='905000'>-- for organizing ligands with respect to the magnitude of</span> <span
  m='908000'>delta O that they exert for a given metal ion.</span> </p><p><span m='911000'>And
  this one just gives us a series that contains five</span> <span m='914000'>ligands.
  But, as you can imagine,</span> <span m='916000'>many more ligands than just these
  five simple ligands have</span> <span m='920000'>been looked at with a variety of
  different metal ions to make a</span> <span m='923000'>pretty big overall comprehensive
  spectrochemical series that sort</span> <span m='927000'>of allows you to pick out
  which ligand you want when you are</span> <span m='931000'>interested in generating
  a particular value of delta O.</span> </p><p><span m='936000'>And here what you
  see is that the weakest one is chloride.</span> </p><p><span m='945000'>We have
  chloride. And then next was fluoride.</span> </p><p><span m='952000'>And then next
  was urea followed by water.</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>And then the strongest
  in this small series of five was</span> <span m='965000'>cyanide. And when we try
  to understand</span> <span m='969000'>the order that these different ligands appear
  in,</span> <span m='973000'>in the spectrochemical series, we are going to find
  out,</span> <span m='979000'>as we study the properties of the molecular orbitals
  of these</span> <span m='985000'>systems, that cyanide is a pi acid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='990000'>And that down here, chloride is a pi donor.</span> </p><p><span m='993000'>And
  in the middle, you have systems like water</span> <span m='997000'>which is more
  or less sigma only.</span> </p><p><span m='1000000'>So we can understand where specific
  ligands appear in the</span> <span m='1005000'>spectrochemical series on the basis
  of their orbital</span> <span m='1010000'>considerations. And that will be the focus
  of</span> <span m='1014000'>the next part of the lecture.</span> </p><p><span m='1035000'>I
  would like to talk a little bit about sigma-only ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>The
  process in which we are now about to engage is very similar</span> <span m='1043000'>to
  that which we used in class for generating the molecular</span> <span m='1047000'>orbital
  energy level diagram for the BH three molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1052000'>In
  that case we had a central boron and three hydrogens around</span> <span m='1056000'>it,
  and we made some hydrogen linear combinations.</span> </p><p><span m='1060000'>And
  we saw how they would interact with the atomic</span> <span m='1063000'>orbitals
  of the boron. And now we are going to do the</span> <span m='1067000'>same thing,
  except we have a lot more orbitals in the system as a</span> <span m='1072000'>whole,
  so we are approximating some of them.</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>Here is a
  typical sigma-only ligand, NH three.</span> </p><p><span m='1080000'>And for NH
  three, we have a lone pair on the</span> <span m='1085000'>nitrogen here. And I
  am drawing it in very</span> <span m='1089000'>simplified fashion, as you will no
  doubt</span> <span m='1093000'>appreciate. There is our lone pair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1096000'>And, when this points directly at the metal,</span> <span m='1101000'>the
  lone pair can make a sigma bond to the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='1119000'>I
  think you will appreciate that if we have a metal out here</span> <span m='1123000'>such
  that this lone pair of electrons is directed right at</span> <span m='1127000'>the
  metal, then that results in a cylindrically symmetric lone</span> <span m='1131000'>pair
  about that metal-nitrogen internuclear axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1135000'>And
  so that would be a sigma-type of interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1138000'>So
  this is called a sigma-only ligand.</span> </p><p><span m='1142000'>And other ligands,
  like cyanide or like chloride,</span> <span m='1148000'>we are going to have to
  add in pi effects, but this is the</span> <span m='1156000'>simple sigma-only case.
  And so if you take a molecule</span> <span m='1163000'>such as this cobalt hexamine
  two plus, --</span> <span m='1170000'>-- or, actually, let's say three plus for</span>
  <span m='1174000'>simplicity here. Cobalt three plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1178000'>And
  we have these NH three ligands at each of the</span> <span m='1184000'>six positions.
  And, in each case,</span> <span m='1187000'>the orientation of the hydrogens on
  these nitrogens is</span> <span m='1192000'>such as to promote a sigma directing
  effect of that lone</span> <span m='1198000'>pair toward the metal. And so that
  lone pair of</span> <span m='1204000'>electrons on the nitrogen for each of these
  ammonia ligands</span> <span m='1209000'>directed right at the metal is providing
  this repulsion that</span> <span m='1215000'>pumps e(g) up in energy. And you will
  see that,</span> <span m='1219000'>hopefully, very clearly now. And let me point
  out that this</span> <span m='1225000'>orbital, here, that I am focusing on is the</span>
  <span m='1229000'>HOMO of NH three. What we are doing is saying you</span> <span
  m='1234000'>have a central metal ion and then you have six ammonia</span> <span
  m='1237000'>ligands pointing at it, each of them pointing their</span> <span m='1240000'>HOMO
  at the metal, their highest occupied</span> <span m='1243000'>molecular orbital.
  What does that do?</span> </p><p><span m='1245000'>What kinds of bonds arise as
  a consequence of that between the</span> <span m='1248000'>metal ion and these six
  ammonia molecules?</span> </p><p><span m='1252000'>And so we will now see what that
  is on the basis of some of</span> <span m='1256000'>the linear combinations that
  we can generate between the six</span> <span m='1261000'>HOMOs of the NH three's
  in this kind of a geometry.</span> </p><p><span m='1282000'>I will do the first
  one over here.</span> </p><p><span m='1292000'>I would like to use a different color
  for that.</span> </p><p><span m='1296000'>I am going to use my blue. All right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1300000'>I am going to draw for you some linear combinations of
  ammonia</span> <span m='1306000'>lone pairs. These are simplistically</span> <span
  m='1309000'>representing the homo of each NH three directed at the</span> <span
  m='1315000'>metal. That one has the symmetry of a</span> <span m='1319000'>cobalt
  s orbital. It has the same sign</span> <span m='1323000'>everywhere. And then, we
  are going to see</span> <span m='1326000'>that you can draw three of these.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1335000'>And I will draw them all right here --</span> <span m='1344000'>--
  in pairs. And this one has the symmetry</span> <span m='1350000'>of a cobalt pz
  atomic orbital. You see it has positive up</span> <span m='1357000'>there. And down
  here,</span> <span m='1359000'>we are taking this to be x, this to be y,</span>
  <span m='1362000'>and this to be z for each of our diagrams,</span> <span m='1366000'>so
  that the phase properties of this combination is that of pz.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1372000'>This one is like px. This one is like py.</span> </p><p><span m='1377000'>And
  the only reason we have to take these linear combinations</span> <span m='1381000'>is
  because we have multiple equivalent ammonia molecules in</span> <span m='1386000'>this
  problem. And then, we have two more that</span> <span m='1389000'>are of interest
  to us. One of these will have a couple</span> <span m='1394000'>of big lobes located
  on z, pointed at the metal and then</span> <span m='1398000'>four small lobes, each
  with negative phase.</span> </p><p><span m='1401000'>I will shade them to indicate
  that negative phase.</span> </p><p><span m='1405000'>And that one will have the
  same phase properties as a cobalt d z</span> <span m='1410000'>squared orbital.
  Plus above, plus below.</span> </p><p><span m='1415000'>And then, to match up with
  the torus in the center of d z</span> <span m='1420000'>squared in the x,y-plane,
  the negative phase</span> <span m='1425000'>shown there. And then, finally,</span>
  <span m='1427000'>over here we have one where all four contributions to this one</span>
  <span m='1432000'>are in the x,y-plane, along the x and y axes and with</span> <span
  m='1437000'>shading as shown there. And that is of the same</span> <span m='1441000'>symmetry
  as our d x squared minus y squared</span> <span m='1447000'>orbital. Having written
  down this set of</span> <span m='1450000'>six linear combinations that we can generate
  from our six</span> <span m='1455000'>ammonia HOMOs, we are done because the cobalt</span>
  <span m='1458000'>has atomic orbitals of these symmetries.</span> </p><p><span m='1462000'>We
  can now use these to make bonds between the ammonia</span> <span m='1466000'>molecules
  and the cobalt. And we can use them to make</span> <span m='1472000'>corresponding
  antibonds.</span> </p><p><span m='1479000'>Here is the MO diagram for the sigma-only
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='1500000'>What we have is an energy level diagram that
  will represent the</span> <span m='1507000'>interaction of these linear combinations
  with the metal</span> <span m='1513000'>valance orbitals. And so I am going to draw
  the</span> <span m='1518000'>metal valance orbitals over here as follows.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1523000'>We have, on the metal, the 3d, the 4s,</span> <span m='1527000'>and
  the 4p. And some of you will notice</span> <span m='1532000'>that this ordering
  of energies is a little different than what</span> <span m='1537000'>you saw when
  you just built up atomic configurations,</span> <span m='1541000'>because what I
  have drawn here is the set of five 3d atomic</span> <span m='1545000'>orbitals is
  down lower in energy than the cobalt 4s and lower in</span> <span m='1551000'>energy,
  that is, even still, than the cobalt 4p.</span> </p><p><span m='1554000'>This is
  our cobalt atom here. And the reason this energy</span> <span m='1559000'>ordering
  for the valance orbitals is difference is</span> <span m='1563000'>because we have
  an ionized cobalt.</span> </p><p><span m='1566000'>And the energies change around
  when you remove an electron from</span> <span m='1570000'>the system as compared
  to the neutral atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1574000'>But one thing that will help
  you remember this ordering of</span> <span m='1578000'>energy levels is that it
  goes in the order of the principle</span> <span m='1582000'>quantum number, which
  kind of does make a</span> <span m='1585000'>little sense. In fact, these energies
  switch</span> <span m='1589000'>around, depending on which of the metals you are
  talking</span> <span m='1593000'>about. But generally 3d and 4s,</span> <span m='1595000'>or
  alternatively 4d and 5s, are pretty close in energy to</span> <span m='1599000'>each
  other, depending on the ion that you are talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='1603000'>And
  then 4p is usually energetically a bit separated</span> <span m='1606000'>from that.
  And then the thing that makes</span> <span m='1609000'>us focus our attention so
  strongly on the d orbitals is</span> <span m='1612000'>that those are the ones closest
  in energy to the ligand orbitals</span> <span m='1617000'>that can interact with
  them. And so let me draw over here a</span> <span m='1623000'>bar that represents
  the six LCs of NH three HOMOs.</span> </p><p><span m='1630000'>In essence, this
  represents these six drawings that I drew</span> <span m='1636000'>over here, linear
  combinations that have the right symmetry to</span> <span m='1643000'>interact with
  certain of valance orbitals on the cobalt,</span> <span m='1650000'>here on the
  left. And what we will find is that--</span> <span m='1656000'>And we will start
  with the 3d, since that is what we are going</span> <span m='1662000'>to be principally
  interested in here.</span> </p><p><span m='1665000'>We come over and find that three
  of the d orbitals do not</span> <span m='1671000'>match any of these because these
  NH three HOMOs all lie</span> <span m='1677000'>in nodal surfaces of them. And that
  will be,</span> <span m='1682000'>of course, our t(2g) set.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1692000'>Those have the same energy as in the ion itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1695000'>They come straight over and don't get involved in bonding or</span>
  <span m='1700000'>antibonding interactions. These are nonbonding.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1710000'>That is t(2g). And then, what we find is that</span> <span m='1713000'>of
  these six linear combinations,</span> <span m='1715000'>two of them, shown right
  here,</span> <span m='1718000'>have the correct phase properties to make bonding
  and</span> <span m='1722000'>antibonding combinations by interacting with d z squared</span>
  <span m='1726000'>and d x squared minus y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1731000'>We
  show that down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>Here is a bonding combination.
  This has e(g) symmetry,</span> <span m='1746000'>and it represents the formation
  of two bonds between the metal</span> <span m='1754000'>and the ligands. And, of
  course,</span> <span m='1758000'>we also make an antibonding combination of the
  same</span> <span m='1764000'>symmetry. This should just remind you of</span> <span
  m='1769000'>the hydrogen H two molecule molecular orbital</span> <span m='1773000'>problem
  built into this much larger structure.</span> </p><p><span m='1776000'>And this
  one, this antibonding case is e g</span> <span m='1779000'>star. And let's just
  quickly look at</span> <span m='1782000'>them.</span> </p><p><span m='1795000'>Here,
  what we have is a d z squared orbital with</span> <span m='1800000'>its torus interacting
  in an out-of-phase manner with these</span> <span m='1805000'>ammonia lone pairs.
  That creates antibonding</span> <span m='1809000'>character here and here, making
  this a high-energy</span> <span m='1814000'>orbital. And then, we have antibonding</span>
  <span m='1818000'>character, too, in between each of the ammonias</span> <span m='1822000'>located
  on the x,y-plane and the torus of the d z squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1827000'>So
  that is one of our two e g</span> <span m='1833000'>star orbitals. And over here,</span>
  <span m='1838000'>we have our d x squared minus y squared orbital</span> <span m='1846000'>making
  antibonding interactions with this other linear</span> <span m='1852000'>combination,
  as shown here, such that we get antibonding</span> <span m='1859000'>all the way
  around. That is e g star.</span> </p><p><span m='1865000'>That is the reason why
  the e(g) set, derived from our set of d</span> <span m='1870000'>orbitals, is marked
  with an asterisk.</span> </p><p><span m='1872000'>It is antibonding with respect
  to these bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>If you start to populate e(g)* with
  electrons,</span> <span m='1880000'>as you will do in certain cases that are high-spin,</span>
  <span m='1883000'>for example, those electrons that go into</span> <span m='1887000'>e(g)*,
  if you reflect back on the way that we calculate bond</span> <span m='1891000'>order,
  they go in there and weaken these two metal ligand</span> <span m='1896000'>bonds.
  And these two bonds look just</span> <span m='1900000'>identical to the ones I drew
  here for e(g)*,</span> <span m='1903000'>just reversing the phase and making them
  bonding everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='1907000'>Let's just look at those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1918000'>Here, we have d z squared making a nice bonding</span>
  <span m='1923000'>combination.</span> </p><p><span m='1930000'>It is interacting
  in an in-phase manner with that linear</span> <span m='1934000'>combination, so
  we have bonding both in the x,y-plane and</span> <span m='1939000'>strongly along
  the z-axis. That is one of these two bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='1945000'>And
  then over here, we will have x squared minus y</span> <span m='1949000'>squared,
  making bonds also --</span> <span m='1959000'>-- like that. Down here, this is bonding,</span>
  <span m='1965000'>and this is antibonding.</span> </p><p><span m='1975000'>Now,
  that is not the entire diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>One runs out of
  space pretty quickly on these</span> <span m='1984000'>horizontally-oriented boards
  for putting together tall MO</span> <span m='1989000'>diagrams, but there were six
  LCs over here.</span> </p><p><span m='1992000'>And you will see that there will
  be another one that makes a</span> <span m='1998000'>bond with the 4s orbital. And
  so, accordingly,</span> <span m='2002000'>the 4s orbital comes up here. There will
  be an antibond</span> <span m='2007000'>derived from 4s. There will be also a set
  of</span> <span m='2012000'>three that are antibonding derived from interaction
  of 4p</span> <span m='2019000'>with the other ones, here.</span> </p><p><span m='2021000'>And
  there is a big energy mismatch between 4p and these,</span> <span m='2027000'>so
  we will draw these as the least stabilized of the set.</span> </p><p><span m='2035000'>But
  now, what you can see down here is that we have found a way</span> <span m='2040000'>to
  form six bonds, six pairs of electrons,</span> <span m='2044000'>each coming from
  the highest occupied molecular orbital of</span> <span m='2049000'>the six ammonia
  molecules. We have formed six bonds using</span> <span m='2054000'>these valance
  orbitals of the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='2057000'>And how many more electrons
  do we have to put into the diagram?</span> </p><p><span m='2062000'>We have six
  because this, in the case of our cobalt (NH</span> <span m='2067000'>three) six
  three plus --</span> <span m='2073000'>This is Group 9. Minus three for the 3+ charge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2077000'>All the ammonia ligands are neutral, equals six.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2081000'>So this is a d six case.</span> </p><p><span m='2083000'>The
  orbitals here that we called t(2g) and e g star</span> <span m='2088000'>can now
  take up six more electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2092000'>And I am drawing them
  in here with the assumption that this is</span> <span m='2097000'>a low-spin case.
  And that is reasonable based on</span> <span m='2102000'>the 3+ charge of this ion.
  We have already discussed the</span> <span m='2106000'>effective charge. It draws
  the ligands in.</span> </p><p><span m='2109000'>It tends to increase the value of
  delta O, as we have seen.</span> </p><p><span m='2114000'>And so this is how I would
  populate that diagram,</span> <span m='2117000'>with the 6d electrons going into
  the nonbonding t(2g)</span> <span m='2121000'>constituting the highest occupied
  molecular orbital of</span> <span m='2126000'>this system. And then, stabilize the
  lone</span> <span m='2130000'>pairs. Down here what is really going</span> <span
  m='2132000'>on, you can think about these six ammonia molecules acting</span> <span
  m='2137000'>simultaneously as six Lewis bases to a metal that has enough</span>
  <span m='2142000'>empty orbitals to accept six lone pair donations to that same</span>
  <span m='2146000'>metal. So it is a Lewis acid times</span> <span m='2149000'>six.
  And it is positively charged,</span> <span m='2151000'>which of course tends to
  draw electron density to it.</span> </p><p><span m='2157000'>And that is our simplified
  molecular orbital diagram for</span> <span m='2160000'>the sigma-only case. Now,
  there are a lot of other</span> <span m='2164000'>interesting cases. As you can
  see here from this</span> <span m='2167000'>spectrochemical series where the ligands
  in the middle are</span> <span m='2171000'>basically sigma-only urea, water.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2173000'>But then at either end of the spectrochemical series,</span>
  <span m='2177000'>you get into systems where you must take pi effects into</span>
  <span m='2181000'>account.</span> </p><p><span m='2199000'>And we will treat, first,
  the case of a pi donor.</span> </p><p><span m='2203000'>Remember that if we are
  talking about a donor,</span> <span m='2208000'>that means we are effectively talking
  about a Lewis base.</span> </p><p><span m='2213000'>And you have to ask yourself
  the question in a system that</span> <span m='2219000'>has a ligand that can make
  pi bonds, are the orbitals on the</span> <span m='2225000'>metal that have pi symmetry
  filled, or are they empty?</span> </p><p><span m='2232000'>And, similarly, are the
  pi symmetry orbitals on</span> <span m='2234000'>the ligand in question filled or
  are they empty?</span> </p><p><span m='2237000'>And, if you can get all that right,
  you will really</span> <span m='2240000'>understand what happens in terms of attenuating
  t(2g) when you</span> <span m='2244000'>add in pi effects. We have seen that the
  e(g)</span> <span m='2246000'>orbitals of a metal are the d z squared and d x</span>
  <span m='2250000'>squared minus y squared that point along the</span> <span m='2253000'>axes.
  The xz, yz, and xy that point</span> <span m='2258000'>between the axes have the
  potential to make pi bonds with</span> <span m='2265000'>ligands. And so here is
  an example of a</span> <span m='2269000'>type of ligand that can make pi bonds to
  a metal.</span> </p><p><span m='2275000'>This ligand is NH two minus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2281000'>And it can make both sigma and pi bonds to a metal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2284000'>It is usually the case that if a ligand is capable of making pi</span>
  <span m='2289000'>bonds to a metal, it is also capable of making</span> <span m='2292000'>sigma
  bonds. And so the pi effects are sort</span> <span m='2295000'>of mapped onto the
  sigma framework.</span> </p><p><span m='2297000'>And so what we found over here
  and here about the sigma only</span> <span m='2301000'>case, that will also be true
  for pi systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2306000'>But then we are superposing on that
  diagram the pi bonds that</span> <span m='2311000'>can form in the system. And the
  way that NH two minus</span> <span m='2315000'>can make both sigma and pi bonds
  with a metal is,</span> <span m='2321000'>first of all, it has a lone pair that
  is</span> <span m='2324000'>directed at the metal, like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2333000'>For forming sigma contacts. And, if you have six of these</span> <span
  m='2337000'>around a metal, the situation would be just the</span> <span m='2340000'>same
  as what we derived over here for the cobalt hexamine.</span> </p><p><span m='2345000'>But
  this is a planar system. The sum of the bond angles</span> <span m='2350000'>around
  the nitrogen in systems like this are 360 degrees</span> <span m='2355000'>meaning
  that, unlike ammonia itself,</span> <span m='2358000'>which is a trigonal pyramid,
  this is a planar system.</span> </p><p><span m='2363000'>And so it has a lone pair
  perpendicular to that plane.</span> </p><p><span m='2374000'>I will draw it that
  way. It is just a pure p-orbital,</span> <span m='2378000'>perpendicular to the
  plane of the substituents on that</span> <span m='2382000'>nitrogen. And the way
  that could make a</span> <span m='2386000'>pi bond with the metal is through simultaneous
  donation</span> <span m='2390000'>above and below the plane of its substituents
  on that nitrogen,</span> <span m='2396000'>so that this ligand can interact as a
  double Lewis base</span> <span m='2400000'>with a metal if the metal has appropriate
  orbitals available.</span> </p><p><span m='2407000'>And so a situation in which
  you might find this would be the</span> <span m='2413000'>following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2430000'>An example of such a molecule, this would be a neutral one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2460000'>And what you see is that the planes of these NH two</span> <span m='2465000'>units
  are lining up with the coordinate xz,</span> <span m='2470000'>yz, and xy Cartesian
  planes in the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2474000'>Since each of these ligands
  is negatively charged and the</span> <span m='2480000'>molecule is neutral, the
  chromium is therefore in</span> <span m='2485000'>the +6 oxidation state to balance
  the six negative charges</span> <span m='2491000'>on the amido ligands, we call
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='2496000'>This is amido. And so this one,</span> <span
  m='2498000'>in fact, is a d zero case.</span> </p><p><span m='2501000'>And d zero
  is an electron count that is pretty</span> <span m='2505000'>typical for the formation
  of pi bonds from ligands that can</span> <span m='2510000'>donate into the metal
  center. If you have d electrons present</span> <span m='2515000'>in a system like
  this, then you won't have the empty</span> <span m='2519000'>d-orbitals on the metal
  that are necessary to accept bonds formed</span> <span m='2524000'>by lone pair
  donation of this sort.</span> </p><p><span m='2529000'>The system will become choked
  up on itself with too many</span> <span m='2533000'>electrons. Let's see what those</span>
  <span m='2535000'>perturbations will lead to for our MO diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2560000'>I am going to focus in on linear combinations of amide</span> <span
  m='2564000'>lone pair orbitals that, in fact, have the correct</span> <span m='2568000'>symmetry
  to interact with our t(2g) set, since that is our pi</span> <span m='2572000'>set
  of orbitals from the d manifold on the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='2576000'>So
  let's look at this.</span> </p><p><span m='2589000'>This would be d(yz).</span>
  </p><p><span m='2599000'>And then, let me choose --</span> <span m='2621000'>We
  can make a pi bond of this sort using a linear combination</span> <span m='2625000'>that
  I am mating up together with the d(yz) orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='2630000'>And
  while I have drawn here the bonding counterpart there,</span> <span m='2634000'>of
  course, will be an antibonding counterpart for</span> <span m='2638000'>that. Let's
  draw the one that belongs</span> <span m='2643000'>to d(xz).</span> </p><p><span
  m='2650000'>And that will be the one up top, here.</span> </p><p><span m='2671000'>So
  what we have is pi bonding happening here,</span> <span m='2674000'>here, here,
  and here that corresponds to pi lone paired</span> <span m='2679000'>donation into
  that metal orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='2682000'>And then, finally, we have one
  that involves the</span> <span m='2686000'>d(xy).</span> </p><p><span m='2695000'>And
  this would be with our hydrogens up and down,</span> <span m='2701000'>here and
  here. Sorry.</span> </p><p><span m='2704000'>Up and down in front and in back like
  that,</span> <span m='2710000'>so that we can make two pi bonding interactions over
  here</span> <span m='2718000'>with this. There is pi bonding,</span> <span m='2722000'>pi
  bonding, bonding, bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='2728000'>At this point, we have
  gotten to where we can</span> <span m='2731000'>recognize how there are three linear
  combinations of the pi</span> <span m='2735000'>lone pairs from these amido ligands
  that will have the</span> <span m='2739000'>correct symmetry to interact with the
  t(2g) set from our</span> <span m='2743000'>metal. There are three more where you</span>
  <span m='2746000'>would just flip one of the two on each, and those would have</span>
  <span m='2751000'>the correct symmetry to interact with the px, py,</span> <span
  m='2754000'>and pz orbitals on the metal. I am not going to draw those</span> <span
  m='2759000'>out since we are focusing on the d part of our diagram at the</span>
  <span m='2763000'>moment.</span> </p><p><span m='2770000'>And what we will find
  then, in the molecular orbital</span> <span m='2775000'>diagram for a system of
  this sort, is that our d manifold,</span> <span m='2781000'>this is our 3d, 4s,
  4p, is such that,</span> <span m='2785000'>you remember previously t two g came
  straight over.</span> </p><p><span m='2793000'>And now, instead, we are going to
  see that it</span> <span m='2796000'>goes up in energy because what t(2g) now is,</span>
  <span m='2800000'>it still has a lot of d(xz), d(yz) and d(xy).</span> </p><p><span
  m='2804000'>But now, t two g has acquired a pi star</span> <span m='2809000'>character
  due to the fact that we have these linear</span> <span m='2814000'>combinations
  over here. These are our pi LCs that we</span> <span m='2818000'>drew over there
  that are of the appropriate symmetry to interact</span> <span m='2824000'>with d(xz),
  d(yz) and d(xy). And, therefore,</span> <span m='2829000'>these that are filled
  are stabilized, come down here and</span> <span m='2834000'>form a t two g set that
  is bonding because those,</span> <span m='2839000'>of course, are filled in, NH
  two minus.</span> </p><p><span m='2844000'>And, if the metal has an empty t two
  g set,</span> <span m='2848000'>you see that we do get three pi bonds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2853000'>t two g now gives us pi antibonds.</span> </p><p><span m='2856000'>This
  is being mapped on the sigma framework that is the same</span> <span m='2860000'>as
  what we have right here for the cobalt hexamine,</span> <span m='2864000'>so that
  above t(2g) we will have the e(g)*.</span> </p><p><span m='2867000'>And will now
  recognize that e(g) is sigma star</span> <span m='2871000'>rather than pi star,
  so it is more strongly</span> <span m='2875000'>destabilized due to the greater
  overlap considerations of</span> <span m='2879000'>forming sigma bonds versus the
  side to side overlap of pi</span> <span m='2883000'>bonds. And the key observation
  here is</span> <span m='2890000'>that pi donors --</span> <span m='2900000'>-- decrease
  the magnitude of delta O by raising the energy of</span> <span m='2906000'>t(2g),
  by making t(2g) pi* in character.</span> </p><p><span m='2910000'>Antibonding. We
  can see, not only that t(2g)</span> <span m='2914000'>should be raised up, but that
  mapping that onto our</span> <span m='2919000'>full sigma framework diagram, delta
  O is shrinking.</span> </p><p><span m='2924000'>We still have our six sigma bonds
  between the NH two</span> <span m='2931000'>ligands and the metal. They are down
  here,</span> <span m='2935000'>just not drawn. It is the same as up here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2941000'>And now, we have three additional pi bonds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2943000'>There are another three additional pi bonds that you can</span> <span
  m='2947000'>draw because we do have six of these NH two minus</span> <span m='2951000'>ligands.
  And then, the corresponding</span> <span m='2953000'>antibonding orbitals involve
  4p. And they are way up here</span> <span m='2957000'>somewhere in energy and very
  empty.</span> </p><p><span m='2959000'>Since this was a d zero case, what we have
  is that you</span> <span m='2963000'>have we pairs of electrons on six NH two minus's</span>
  <span m='2967000'>that are down here in this manifold of metal ligand sigma</span>
  <span m='2970000'>and pi bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='2978000'>And so we have
  12 pairs of electrons down here that</span> <span m='2980000'>describe the sigma
  plus pi bonding between the metal and</span> <span m='2984000'>the ligands. And
  then you come here to your</span> <span m='2986000'>d manifold, these are empty
  because this is a d zero</span> <span m='2989000'>case, because I happened to choose
  chromium in the six plus</span> <span m='2993000'>oxidation here. So it is a d zero
  case,</span> <span m='2996000'>and we wouldn't have any electrons to put in here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3000000'>But, under these circumstances, in order to get color in
  a</span> <span m='3004000'>system like this, you would have to be promoting</span>
  <span m='3007000'>an electron from down here from these pi bonds probably into the</span>
  <span m='3012000'>d manifold, for example. And what we have seen here,</span> <span
  m='3016130'>namely that pi donors decrease delta O should give you a clue</span>
  <span m='3020000'>as to what is going on with chloride and fluoride.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3024000'>Since those have small values of delta O, they lie at a</span> <span
  m='3028190'>position of weakness in the spectrochemical series.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3033000'>And in the converse, that ligands like cyanide and</span> <span m='3036000'>especially
  carbon monoxide are very high in the spectrochemical</span> <span m='3041000'>series
  because they are pi acid ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='3044000'>And this is something
  you will be getting more information</span> <span m='3048382'>about in recitation
  this week. See you all on Wednesday.</span> </p>
