  following content is provided by MIT OpenCourseWare</span> <span m=''4000''>under
  a Creative Commons license.</span> </p><p><span m=''6000''>Additional information
  about our license and MIT</span> <span m=''10000''>OpenCourseWare in general is
  available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m=''15000''>Let''s pick up from where
  we were on Friday.</span> </p><p><span m=''19000''>We had discovered the nucleus.
  Now we were faced with the</span> <span m=''24000''>problem, as all the scientific
  community was in 1911,</span> <span m=''30000''>in trying to understand the structure
  of the atom.</span> </p><p><span m=''36000''>Where was the nucleus in the atom?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''38000''>Where was the electron? How were they bound?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''41000''>How did they hang together? And we talked about the fact</span> <span
  m=''46000''>that the electron in the nucleus, the force of</span> <span m=''49000''>interaction
  is the Coulomb force.</span> </p><p><span m=''53000''>And we started talking about
  how, at that time,</span> <span m=''56000''>the only equation of motion that was
  going to allow us to</span> <span m=''61000''>figure out how the electron and nucleus
  moved under influence of</span> <span m=''66000''>this Coulomb force was Newton''s
  equations of motion,</span> <span m=''71000''>in particular the Second Law, F equals
  ma.</span> </p><p><span m=''75000''>And so, in order to apply that equation of motion,</span>
  <span m=''79000''>we needed a model for the atom. And what was the simplest and</span>
  <span m=''84000''>most obvious thing to do was to suggest the planetary model.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''91000''>After all, that is how the astronomical bodies moved around</span>
  <span m=''95000''>the sun. And so the model that is set up</span> <span m=''99000''>is
  one where this electron has a uniform circular motion around</span> <span m=''104000''>the
  nucleus with a well-defined radius, which we called r star.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''109000''>We said that given this,</span> <span m=''112000''>the acceleration
  was a constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''114000''>It was given by v squared over.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''120000''>The linear velocity over r. We plugged that into F equals,</span>
  <span m=''125000''>put in the Coulomb force,</span> <span m=''128000''>and from
  that we were able to calculate the kinetic energy of</span> <span m=''134000''>that
  electron going around the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m=''138000''>Well, the reason
  I want to calculate the kinetic energy</span> <span m=''143000''>from this model
  is because I want to ultimately calculate the</span> <span m=''148000''>total energy.
  And why I want to calculate the</span> <span m=''153000''>total energy is going
  to be obvious in just a few minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''158000''>My goal is
  to get the total energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''161000''>Actually, I am using my
  notes from Friday because I didn''t</span> <span m=''166000''>finish them. You may
  need to get them out.</span> </p><p><span m=''170000''>This will probably often
  be the case, is that I won''t quite</span> <span m=''175000''>finish the notes from
  the other lecture.</span> </p><p><span m=''180000''>I will start out the next lecture
  where I left off,</span> <span m=''184000''>so you should bring your previous day''s
  notes to class</span> <span m=''189000''>if, in fact, you use them during class.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''193000''>I want the kinetic energy plus the potential energy because
  I</span> <span m=''198000''>want both of them to add them up to get the total energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''204000''>I know the kinetic energy. Now, we need the potential</span>
  <span m=''209000''>energy. What is the potential energy?</span> </p><p><span m=''213000''>Well,
  the potential energy is the integral over the operating</span> <span m=''219000''>force
  over the appropriate limits.</span> </p><p><span m=''222000''>In this case, if our
  force of interaction is</span> <span m=''226000''>the Coulomb force, which I will
  just represent as</span> <span m=''230000''>F of r, I am going to integrate this</span>
  <span m=''234000''>from r star out, and this is going to be minus</span> <span m=''238000''>the
  integral of the force. Now, some of you may have seen</span> <span m=''244000''>this
  before. This is a general case,</span> <span m=''248000''>the potential energy of
  anything is minus the integral</span> <span m=''253000''>of the operating force
  over the appropriate coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m=''258000''>If you have seen
  it before, that is fine,</span> <span m=''262000''>you are happy. If you have not
  seen this</span> <span m=''266000''>before, you are panicked. Don''t panic.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''271000''>I do not hold you responsible for this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''274000''>You will see it in 8.01 later on this semester.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''278000''>When you see it later on, you can come back here and say,</span> <span
  m=''282000''>okay, now I know what is going on.</span> </p><p><span m=''285000''>But
  I just need it right now to make a point about the total</span> <span m=''290000''>energy
  of the system. And that is what is going to</span> <span m=''294000''>lead me to
  the conundrum. I need the potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''300000''>It
  is the integral of the force.</span> </p><p><span m=''302000''>Let me plug in, here,
  my force that is</span> <span m=''305000''>operating, e squared 4 pi epsilon nought
  r squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''310000''>I do that integral and put in</span>
  <span m=''314000''>the appropriate limits. It is minus e squared over 4 pi</span>
  <span m=''319000''>epsilon nought r star.</span> </p><p><span m=''323000''>Now I
  have kinetic energy plus potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''327000''>Let
  me add them up. The kinetic is one-half e</span> <span m=''332000''>squared 4 pi
  epsilon nought r star.</span> </p><p><span m=''337000''>Potential, minus e squared
  over</span> <span m=''341000''>4 pi epsilon nought r star.</span> </p><p><span m=''347000''>The
  result is minus one-half e squared 4 pi epsilon nought r</span> <span m=''352000''>star.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''355000''>That is the total energy here</span> <span m=''361000''>of
  this particular system. Well, why I wanted this total</span> <span m=''368000''>energy
  is to show you that this total energy is negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''375000''>What
  that negative means to us is that the system is bound.</span> </p><p><span m=''383000''>The
  electron and the nucleus are stuck together.</span> </p><p><span m=''390000''>And
  I can show you that maybe a little more clearly if I draw an</span> <span m=''395000''>energy
  level diagram. Let me plot here the total</span> <span m=''399000''>energy. And
  I am plotting it as a</span> <span m=''402000''>function of r, the distance between
  the</span> <span m=''405000''>electron and the nucleus. Well, what you can see is
  that</span> <span m=''410000''>for very large r, the energy here is going to be</span>
  <span m=''414000''>zero. Way out here,</span> <span m=''417000''>for very large
  r, where we have the electron and</span> <span m=''421000''>the nucleus separated
  infinitely apart, the energy is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''426000''>And, of course,
  as you bring them closer</span> <span m=''429000''>together, the energy goes down.
  And when you are exactly,</span> <span m=''434000''>and we calculated this, at r
  star here,</span> <span m=''437000''>well, then the total energy is minus one-half
  e squared over 4</span> <span m=''442000''>pi epsilon nought times r star.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''447000''>If you brought the electron and</span> <span m=''452000''>the
  nucleus into this value here of r star,</span> <span m=''456000''>the energy would
  change like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''459000''>But the big point is this energy
  is negative,</span> <span m=''462000''>or it is lower than the electron and the
  nucleus</span> <span m=''466000''>separated. That means that the electron</span>
  <span m=''469000''>and nucleus are stuck together. You are going to have to put</span>
  <span m=''474000''>this much energy into the system in order to pull them apart.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''480000''>That is the big point here, is that this model so far
  looks</span> <span m=''485000''>like everything is hunky-dory. Everything is working.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''490000''>The electron stuck to the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''494000''>It is not going anywhere. It looks terrific.</span> </p><p><span m=''498000''>But
  here comes the conundrum. The conundrum is that classical</span> <span m=''504000''>electromagnetism,
  which was pretty well</span> <span m=''508000''>understood by this time, 1911, 1912.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''513000''>Maxwell''s equations, that was down pat.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''517000''>But what classical electromagnetism says is that</span> <span m=''522000''>when
  you have a charge, and this electron is a charge,</span> <span m=''528000''>that
  is accelerating, that charge has to be emitting</span> <span m=''534000''>radiation.
  It has to be giving off energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''540000''>After all, that
  is actually how an antenna works.</span> </p><p><span m=''545000''>In an antenna,
  what you are doing is taking</span> <span m=''549000''>charge and sloshing it, accelerating
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''553000''>When it accelerates, it emits radiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''558000''>That is how you broadcast. That is true,</span> <span
  m=''562000''>it was known in 1911. Synchrotron radiation works the</span> <span
  m=''567000''>same way. When you have a synchrotron,</span> <span m=''572000''>the
  way you get synchrotron radiation is essentially by</span> <span m=''577000''>accelerating
  charge. That is a given and is</span> <span m=''581000''>actually, again, something
  you will talk about</span> <span m=''586000''>in much more detail in 8.02. But the
  point here is if this</span> <span m=''591000''>charge is being accelerated, and
  it is, then it must be</span> <span m=''596000''>giving off radiation. It must be
  giving off energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''602000''>Well, if it is giving off energy,
  we look at our energy</span> <span m=''606000''>expression here. That must mean
  that the energy</span> <span m=''610000''>in the system is going down because it
  is losing the energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''615000''>It is giving it off to radiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''617000''>If E is going down, it is getting more negative</span>
  <span m=''621000''>here. The only way for E to get more</span> <span m=''624000''>negative
  is for this r star right here to be changing.</span> </p><p><span m=''630000''>Is
  for r star to be getting smaller and smaller and smaller.</span> </p><p><span m=''637000''>Well,
  we could set up another set of equations using what we</span> <span m=''644000''>know
  from classical electromagnetism and from what</span> <span m=''650000''>we have
  already done here. What we would find is that this</span> <span m=''656000''>value
  here of r star would go to zero in t equal 10^-10 seconds</span> <span m=''664000''>if
  r was originally on the order of an angstrom to begin with.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''673000''>Here is the problem. Classical equations of motion</span> <span m=''678000''>coupled
  with classical electromagnetism,</span> <span m=''682000''>they are making a prediction
  that my atom is not going to</span> <span m=''689000''>live more than 10^-10 seconds.
  Because in 10^-10 seconds,</span> <span m=''695000''>that electron is on top of
  the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m=''698000''>We no longer have an atom that was
  already known to have a</span> <span m=''703000''>volume associated with a diameter
  that is about an</span> <span m=''707000''>angstrom. The classical way of thinking</span>
  <span m=''711000''>is making a prediction that is not consistent with the</span>
  <span m=''715000''>observations at that time. And even now,</span> <span m=''718000''>it
  is predicted that the atom essentially kind of annihilates,</span> <span m=''724000''>collapses
  in 10^-10 seconds. And that is the problem that</span> <span m=''730599''>the scientific
  community had in</span> <span m=''733000''>That is the problem we have right now.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''737000''>And they had it for 10, 12 years.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''740000''>Now you can say what is wrong here?</span> </p><p><span m=''743000''>Well,
  it is possible, and they were thinking about</span> <span m=''748000''>this, too.
  It is possible that maybe this</span> <span m=''752000''>force is wrong, this Coulomb
  force.</span> </p><p><span m=''755000''>That is a possibility. Or, of course,</span>
  <span m=''758000''>maybe it is the equations of motion that are wrong.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''762000''>That is possible. Or, maybe it is classical</span> <span m=''766000''>electromagnetism
  that is wrong. Well, of course what it is</span> <span m=''770000''>going to turn
  out to be is the equations of motion,</span> <span m=''774000''>F equals ma. Bottom
  line is that you cannot</span> <span m=''780000''>use classical mechanics to explain
  the motion of this</span> <span m=''785000''>microscopic particle, the atom, in
  the constrained</span> <span m=''790000''>environment of an atom. That is the bottom
  line.</span> </p><p><span m=''794000''>We need different mechanics. We cannot use
  classical</span> <span m=''798000''>mechanics to describe how that electron hangs
  on that nucleus,</span> <span m=''804000''>how they are bound. And so that was the
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''810000''>This signaled something was really amiss
  in the scientific</span> <span m=''815000''>community in the world at that time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''818000''>That is our problem now, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''820000''>What
  is the next step? Well, historically the clues</span> <span m=''825000''>about why
  the electron did not actually collapse into the</span> <span m=''830000''>nucleus,
  like classical physics predicted, came from a</span> <span m=''835000''>completely
  different area of discussion.</span> </p><p><span m=''840000''>It came from the
  discussion of the wave-particle duality of</span> <span m=''845000''>light and matter.
  It was long believed that</span> <span m=''849000''>matter, with its particle-like
  behavior, was distinct from</span> <span m=''855000''>light, which was this transmission
  of energy through</span> <span m=''860000''>space. But, in the last 1800s and</span>
  <span m=''864000''>early 1900s, there were a few experiments that appeared on the</span>
  <span m=''869000''>horizon that began to suggest that maybe this boundary between</span>
  <span m=''873000''>matter with its particle-like behavior and radiation with its</span>
  <span m=''878000''>wave-like behavior was not as rigid as thought.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''882000''>And, in fact, what we are going to see is</span> <span m=''885000''>that
  radiation has both wave-like properties and</span> <span m=''889000''>particle-like
  properties. It depends on the particular</span> <span m=''893000''>experiment that
  you do which one of those behaviors you see.</span> </p><p><span m=''900000''>And,
  consequently, matter behaves both as a</span> <span m=''904000''>particle and a
  wave. Again, it depends on exactly</span> <span m=''909000''>what experiment you
  do, which one of those properties</span> <span m=''914000''>you observe. What we
  are going to do right</span> <span m=''918000''>now is put aside the discussion
  of the structure of the atom.</span> </p><p><span m=''924000''>We are going to put
  it aside until next Monday.</span> </p><p><span m=''930000''>We have to do that
  because we need some more information in</span> <span m=''933000''>order to take
  a big leap to get us out of this constraint of</span> <span m=''937000''>classical
  mechanics. And those clues,</span> <span m=''940000''>as I said, came from this
  discussion of the wave-particle</span> <span m=''944000''>duality of light and matter.
  And that is what we are going</span> <span m=''948000''>to be talking about for
  the next three lectures.</span> </p><p><span m=''951000''>Then we are going to come
  back and tie in those results to the</span> <span m=''955000''>structure of the
  atom. Of course, where that is going</span> <span m=''960000''>to lead us is a new
  equation of motion called quantum mechanics.</span> </p><p><span m=''965000''>That
  is where we are going. Let''s start off by talking</span> <span m=''970000''>about
  radiation or light. We are going to talk about its</span> <span m=''974000''>wave-like
  properties, then Wednesday we are going to</span> <span m=''979000''>talk about
  the particle-like properties of light,</span> <span m=''983000''>and Friday we are
  going to talk about the wave-like properties</span> <span m=''988000''>of matter.
  That is where we are going.</span> </p><p><span m=''992000''>Let''s talk about waves
  here. You all know that waves are</span> <span m=''998000''>some periodic variation
  of a quantity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1002000''>A water wave, for example,</span>
  <span m=''1005000''>is a periodic variation of the level of water.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1009000''>At some points in space, the water level is high.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1014000''>At other points, the water level is low.</span> </p><p><span m=''1020000''>Sound
  wave. Well, a sound wave is the</span> <span m=''1023000''>periodic variation of
  the density of air.</span> </p><p><span m=''1027000''>At some points in space, the
  air is very dense.</span> </p><p><span m=''1031000''>At other points in space, the
  air is not dense.</span> </p><p><span m=''1036000''>Well, light or radiation is
  a period variation of an electric</span> <span m=''1042000''>field, as I depict
  here on this slide.</span> </p><p><span m=''1045000''>Electric field versus position.
  There is a periodic variation</span> <span m=''1052000''>of the electric field.
  Now, exactly what is an</span> <span m=''1057000''>electric field? Some of you know
  this,</span> <span m=''1060000''>some of you don''t, but an electric field is</span>
  <span m=''1064000''>literally the space through which the Coulomb force</span> <span
  m=''1069000''>operates. For example,</span> <span m=''1071000''>if we have a negatively
  charged plate and a positively charged</span> <span m=''1077000''>plate here. The
  space through which the</span> <span m=''1082000''>Coulomb force is operating here,
  and the Coulomb force is</span> <span m=''1086000''>operating because we have two
  plates here that are oppositely</span> <span m=''1091000''>charged. The electric
  field is the space</span> <span m=''1094000''>through which the Coulomb force operates.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1097000''>If we put a positive charge in that space, you know what
  is</span> <span m=''1102000''>going to happen. In this coordinated system,</span>
  <span m=''1105000''>the positive charge is going to float up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1110000''>Because the negatively charged plate is up above.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1114000''>If we reversed the potential difference and put a positively</span>
  <span m=''1120000''>charged particle in this electric field,</span> <span m=''1124000''>in
  this space, it is going to move down</span> <span m=''1128000''>because now the
  negatively charged plate is lower.</span> </p><p><span m=''1133000''>This electric
  field here has not only magnitude --</span> <span m=''1139000''>You can imagine
  here the magnitude is given by the</span> <span m=''1142000''>difference in the
  potentials of these plates.</span> </p><p><span m=''1145000''>The larger the difference,
  the larger the magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''1149000''>But it also has direction.
  In one case,</span> <span m=''1152000''>it is pointed this way. In the other case,</span>
  <span m=''1155000''>it is pointed that way. And that is reflected here on</span>
  <span m=''1159000''>this plot of the electric field here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1162000''>What
  you see is that right here, the magnitude of the</span> <span m=''1166000''>electric
  field is small. As you move along in x,</span> <span m=''1171000''>that magnitude
  increases, goes to a maximum,</span> <span m=''1174000''>then turns around and at
  some point literally is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1179000''>And then the electric
  field changes direction and its</span> <span m=''1184000''>magnitude increases in
  the opposite direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''1188000''>Increases, increases,
  gets to a point,</span> <span m=''1191000''>then turns around and becomes zero again.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1195000''>If you have a charge in a radiation field and you put
  it</span> <span m=''1200000''>right here -- Well, it would be pulled in one</span>
  <span m=''1205000''>direction. If you put it over here,</span> <span m=''1208000''>it
  would be pulled in the other direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''1212000''>We have
  a magnitude and we have a direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''1216000''>Now, not
  only is light a periodic variation of the</span> <span m=''1221000''>electric field
  in space, it is also a periodic variation</span> <span m=''1226000''>of the electric
  field in time. That is, this is a picture of</span> <span m=''1232000''>that field,
  that one instant in time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1235000''>We will call it t equals
  0.</span> </p><p><span m=''1239000''>However, that electric field moves.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1242000''>It propagates. And the distance,</span> <span m=''1245000''>or
  the time it takes for the electric field here to move over</span> <span m=''1250000''>one
  wavelength, I have shown this as a star.</span> </p><p><span m=''1254000''>The time
  it takes for this maximum to go from here to here,</span> <span m=''1259000''>one
  wavelength, is defined as one period.</span> </p><p><span m=''1265000''>And a period
  is given by one over nu,</span> <span m=''1269000''>where nu is the frequency of
  the radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1272000''>It is the number of cycles per
  second.</span> </p><p><span m=''1276000''>In other words, if you were sitting here
  at x</span> <span m=''1280000''>equals 0, you were tied at x equals 0,</span> <span
  m=''1284000''>and you were just watching this electric field come by.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1290000''>You would see a maximum in that electric field,</span> <span m=''1294000''>one
  maximum every second if the frequency is one Hertz.</span> </p><p><span m=''1300000''>In
  other words, the frequency is the number of</span> <span m=''1304000''>maxima you
  would see pass by you per second.</span> </p><p><span m=''1309000''>Well, we have
  a unit to characterize frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''1314000''>I call it cycles
  per second. It is cycles per second,</span> <span m=''1320000''>but the formal unit
  is Hertz. Hertz is inverse seconds.</span> </p><p><span m=''1326000''>We leave out
  the number of cycles.</span> </p><p><span m=''1330000''>The number of cycles is
  implied in the unit of Hertz.</span> </p><p><span m=''1336000''>To give another
  example, here, suppose we had some</span> <span m=''1342000''>radiation and the
  frequency of that radiation was one Hertz.</span> </p><p><span m=''1350000''>Suppose
  we had an electron, an electron is charged,</span> <span m=''1354000''>and we put
  here at x equals 0 and we tie it at x equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m=''1360000''>What
  is going to happen to this electron?</span> </p><p><span m=''1364000''>Well, what
  is going to happen is that this electron is going</span> <span m=''1370000''>to
  be pulled down and then it is going to be pushed back up once</span> <span m=''1376000''>every
  second because the frequency, here,</span> <span m=''1380000''>is one Hertz. It
  is charged,</span> <span m=''1384000''>and we are tying it at x equals</span> <span
  m=''1387000''>It is going to go like this. It is going to oscillate once</span>
  <span m=''1393000''>every second if this frequency is one hertz.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1397000''>Here it goes. An electron is pulled down and</span> <span m=''1402000''>then
  pushed back up once every second.</span> </p><p><span m=''1406000''>Now, we, of
  course, can write an equation to</span> <span m=''1410000''>describe this oscillation
  of the electric field in both space and</span> <span m=''1416000''>time. x is the
  position variable,</span> <span m=''1421000''>t, the time variable, and I have written
  it down</span> <span m=''1425000''>here. I will explain this more in</span> <span
  m=''1429000''>just a moment, but what I also want to point</span> <span m=''1433000''>out
  is that an oscillating electric field always,</span> <span m=''1437000''>always,
  always has perpendicular to it an</span> <span m=''1441000''>oscillating magnetic
  field. That is well described by</span> <span m=''1446000''>Maxwell''s equations.
  Again, you are going to see</span> <span m=''1450000''>that in 8.02. And the magnetic
  field here has</span> <span m=''1453000''>the same essentially function form and
  characteristics as this</span> <span m=''1458000''>electric field. And, because
  it does,</span> <span m=''1460000''>I am just going to talk about the electric field.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1464000''>Here is the expression for the magnetic field.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1467000''>I just call it H. But, again, it is a function of</span>
  <span m=''1472000''>position and time. Here is an illustration,</span> <span m=''1476000''>just
  the variation of the electric field.</span> </p><p><span m=''1480000''>Light, radiation
  is actually a variation in space and time of</span> <span m=''1485000''>both the
  electric and a magnetic field.</span> </p><p><span m=''1489000''>That is why it
  is electromagnetic radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1493000''>Now, let me show
  you on the 8.02 website.</span> </p><p><span m=''1496000''>Let me get that rolling.
  There it is.</span> </p><p><span m=''1501000''>Now we have to start it. All right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1504000''>One of these is the electric field.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1507000''>The other one is the magnetic field.</span> </p><p><span m=''1510000''>This
  is a simulation that 8.02 has made for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''1514000''>You
  can go and look at it on the 8.02 website,</span> <span m=''1518000''>but you can
  see it propagating here in time,</span> <span m=''1522000''>and you can see its
  variation in space of this electromagnetic</span> <span m=''1528000''>field. Let''s
  look at this functional</span> <span m=''1532000''>form just a little more carefully,
  just to make sure</span> <span m=''1535000''>everybody is on the same page. I think
  many of you have seen</span> <span m=''1539000''>this before. What we are going
  to do,</span> <span m=''1542000''>because we have two variables, is we are going
  to hold one</span> <span m=''1546000''>variable constant and plot it as a function
  of the other</span> <span m=''1550000''>variable, just to explain the parameters
  that go into this</span> <span m=''1553000''>functional form. At time t equals 0,</span>
  <span m=''1557000''>if in this equation here I stick in t equals 0,</span> <span
  m=''1561000''>I have a form that looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1563000''>It
  is just the cosine function in x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1567000''>And you can
  see that the amplitude goes from positive A</span> <span m=''1571000''>to minus
  A. And so what you see is that</span> <span m=''1574000''>this A in front of the
  cosine, the physical meaning of it is</span> <span m=''1579000''>just the maximum
  amplitude. If you were given a functional</span> <span m=''1583000''>form with a
  number in front of a cosine, well,</span> <span m=''1587000''>you could read off
  the amplitude immediately.</span> </p><p><span m=''1592000''>The other parameter
  that characterizes this wave is the</span> <span m=''1596000''>wavelength. It is
  the distance between two</span> <span m=''1600000''>successive maxima or two successive
  minima.</span> </p><p><span m=''1604000''>And you can also see here that the field
  is going to be at its</span> <span m=''1610000''>maximum amplitude whenever this
  x is an integral multiple of the</span> <span m=''1615000''>wavelength, lambda,
  2 lambda, 3 lambda,</span> <span m=''1619000''>or minus lambda, minus 2 lambda or
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1624000''>If you were given a waveform and there was
  a number in front</span> <span m=''1628000''>of the x, you can almost, by inspection,</span>
  <span m=''1632000''>tell what the wavelength is. That number would be equal to 2</span>
  <span m=''1637000''>pi over lambda. Now what we are going to do is</span> <span
  m=''1640000''>hold x constant and set it equal to zero, and then plot this</span>
  <span m=''1645000''>functional form as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1650000''>Again,
  we have the cosine function, oscillates from plus A</span> <span m=''1656000''>to
  minus A. Now the time between two</span> <span m=''1659000''>successive maxima or
  minima is what we spoke earlier of as the</span> <span m=''1666000''>period. It
  is the time for one cycle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1670000''>In other words, is
  it one over the frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''1676000''>And you get the maxima
  then whenever the time is an integral</span> <span m=''1681000''>multiple of the
  period, whenever time is 1 over nu,</span> <span m=''1686000''>2 over nu, 3 over
  nu, or minus 1 over nu,</span> <span m=''1689000''>minus 2 over nu, or zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1694000''>These are the characteristics of the</span> <span m=''1698000''>functional
  form, amplitudes, wavelengths,</span> <span m=''1702000''>frequencies. Now, I told
  you that the period</span> <span m=''1706000''>was given by 1 over nu.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1711000''>Let''s just do a quick proof that the period is actually 1</span>
  <span m=''1716000''>over nu, one over frequency. How are we going to do that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1722000''>Well, what I said was the definition for a period was
  the</span> <span m=''1728000''>time it takes the wave to move one wavelength.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1733000''>If this is the wave at t equals 0, this then coming up
  here</span> <span m=''1739000''>should be the wave at one period later.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1745000''>And so, if we moved over exactly one cycle,</span> <span m=''1749000''>what
  this means is that at one period later the functional form</span> <span m=''1756000''>ought
  to look exactly like it did at t equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m=''1761000''>If
  I take my general expression for the waveform and plug in t</span> <span m=''1767000''>equals
  1 over nu, I get this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1773000''>What you can see at first
  glance is that it doesn''t really</span> <span m=''1776000''>look like this, or
  at least not just yet,</span> <span m=''1779000''>but we are going to make it look
  like this and we are going</span> <span m=''1783000''>to do so legally. What are
  we going do?</span> </p><p><span m=''1786000''>This just repeats that equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1788000''>You can already see we have some cancellation here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1791000''>These two nu''s go away, so I just have cosine ((2 pi
  x)</span> <span m=''1795000''>over lambda minus 2 pi).</span> </p><p><span m=''1800000''>In
  order to simplify this, I am going to need a</span> <span m=''1803000''>trigonometric
  identity, which you may or may not</span> <span m=''1806000''>remember, cosine (alpha
  minus beta) is the cosine alpha times</span> <span m=''1811000''>cosine beta plus
  the sine of the alpha sine beta.</span> </p><p><span m=''1819000''>I am going to
  let 2(pi)x be alpha, and beta will be 2pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''1823000''>I am
  going to plug that in. Here, we can see some nice</span> <span m=''1827000''>simplification.
  This cosine 2pi,</span> <span m=''1831000''>of course, is one. The sign of</span>
  <span m=''1835000''>2pi is zero, this term goes away, and what I have left is A</span>
  <span m=''1840000''>cosine 2 pi x over lambda at t equals 1 over nu.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1845000''>And, indeed,</span> <span m=''1848000''>that is the same functional
  field as the field at t equals</span> <span m=''1855000''>period is equal to 1 over
  nu.</span> </p><p><span m=''1860000''>Now, this wave also propagates in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1863000''>It moves. It goes from here to here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1866000''>And another important characteristic of</span> <span m=''1870000''>electromagnetic
  reaction is the speed with which it propagates.</span> </p><p><span m=''1875000''>Let''s
  just quickly calculate what that speed is.</span> </p><p><span m=''1880000''>We
  have enough information to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1883000''>Speed is always
  distance traveled divided by time</span> <span m=''1887000''>elapsed. And we said
  that at t equals 0,</span> <span m=''1892000''>this is what our waveform looked
  like.</span> </p><p><span m=''1896000''>We also said that one period later, this
  is what our waveform</span> <span m=''1901000''>looked like. We know at one period
  that the</span> <span m=''1905000''>waveform moved over one wavelength.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1908000''>The speed is the distance traveled, which is a wavelength,</span>
  <span m=''1913000''>divided by the time elapsed, which is 1 over nu,</span> <span
  m=''1917000''>the period. Therefore, the speed is lambda</span> <span m=''1923000''>times
  nu. That is the speed with which</span> <span m=''1927000''>this wave propagates.
  And, of course,</span> <span m=''1931000''>you already know that all electromagnetic
  radiation has a</span> <span m=''1937000''>constant speed of about 3x10^8 meters
  per second,</span> <span m=''1942000''>or we call it c. And what that is,</span>
  <span m=''1946000''>is the product of the wavelength times the frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1953000''>The electromagnetic spectrum, of course, is infinitely
  wide.</span> </p><p><span m=''1958000''>And here is the electromagnetic spectrum.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1961000''>We won''t do this in any kind of detail, but I just want
  you to</span> <span m=''1966000''>note here that on the long wavelength end,</span>
  <span m=''1970000''>we have what we call radio waves.</span> </p><p><span m=''1972000''>And
  on the short wavelength, then, we have our gamma rays</span> <span m=''1977000''>and
  cosmic rays. And, in the case of the gamma</span> <span m=''1982000''>and the cosmic
  rays, because the wavelength is</span> <span m=''1986000''>small, lambda is small,
  that means those waves have a</span> <span m=''1990000''>high frequency. In the
  case of the radio waves,</span> <span m=''1994000''>because those wavelengths are
  long, that means those waves</span> <span m=''1999000''>have a lower frequency because
  the frequency times the</span> <span m=''2004000''>wavelength is a constant. It
  is this c.</span> </p><p><span m=''2007000''>It is 3x10^8 meters per second. And,
  of course,</span> <span m=''2012000''>right in here, a very small region,</span>
  <span m=''2015000''>narrow region of the electromagnetic spectrum,</span> <span
  m=''2019000''>are the light waves that are sensitive to our eye.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2024000''>What you do need to know is that the red wavelengths are</span> <span
  m=''2029000''>longer and the blue wavelengths are shorter.</span> </p><p><span m=''2033000''>Again,
  the important thing is lambda times nu is always,</span> <span m=''2038000''>for
  every kind of radiation, equal to a constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''2044000''>And
  that constant is c. Now,</span> <span m=''2047000''>the other thing that you just
  need to know is the relative</span> <span m=''2051000''>ordering here in wavelengths.
  You do need to know that</span> <span m=''2055000''>microwaves are longer wavelengths
  than gamma rays.</span> </p><p><span m=''2059000''>All MIT students should know
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2062000''>And one other thing I might say, because
  we are going to</span> <span m=''2066000''>talk about this a little later in the
  course.</span> </p><p><span m=''2071000''>See these microwaves? Well, molecules
  will absorb</span> <span m=''2074000''>microwaves, take it in. That kind of radiation
  is going</span> <span m=''2078000''>to set the molecule rotating. Molecules will
  absorb infrared</span> <span m=''2083000''>radiation, and that kind of radiation
  is going to set the</span> <span m=''2087000''>molecules vibrating. Molecules will
  absorb visible</span> <span m=''2091000''>and ultraviolet radiation. What that is
  going to do is</span> <span m=''2095000''>promote an electron to an excited state.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2100000''>Then sometimes those electrons, in the excited state,</span>
  <span m=''2104000''>want to relax back down to the ground state.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2108000''>When they do so they give off radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2111000''>That
  is the origin of fluorescence and sometimes</span> <span m=''2115000''>phosphorescence.
  Then sometimes molecules will</span> <span m=''2119000''>also fluoresce if they
  absorb X-rays, but with X-rays,</span> <span m=''2123000''>if a molecule absorbs
  them, it also kicks out an electron.</span> </p><p><span m=''2130000''>And we will
  be looking at that in a few days to identify the</span> <span m=''2135000''>energy
  levels in atoms and molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''2138000''>This, I think,
  you are familiar with.</span> </p><p><span m=''2141000''>So far I have just told
  you what electromagnetic radiation</span> <span m=''2147000''>is, how we characterize
  it: speed, frequency,</span> <span m=''2151000''>wavelength, maximum amplitude.
  But what I have not shown you,</span> <span m=''2156000''>yet, is any evidence that
  indeed light has wave-like</span> <span m=''2161000''>characteristics. And to do
  that we are going to</span> <span m=''2166000''>do the experiment that essentially
  was done to</span> <span m=''2170000''>demonstrate the wave-like behavior of light,</span>
  <span m=''2174000''>and that is Young''s two-slit experiment.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2177000''>This is the late 1800s. What was done was to take a</span> <span m=''2182000''>source
  of monochromatic radiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2185000''>We are going to use
  6 angstroms, 633 nanometers.</span> </p><p><span m=''2191000''>It is a helium neon
  laser. And it is going to impinge on</span> <span m=''2196000''>just a thin metal
  plate. It does not have to be metal.</span> </p><p><span m=''2201000''>It can be
  anything. But what we did was poke two</span> <span m=''2205000''>holes in it, made
  two slits. And naively you might think,</span> <span m=''2211000''>if you looked
  at a screen out here, that this screen will</span> <span m=''2216000''>light up
  in spots that are directly opposite those slights.</span> </p><p><span m=''2223000''>Because,
  after all, light travels in straight</span> <span m=''2227000''>lines. And so if
  the slits here are</span> <span m=''2230000''>0.005 meters apart, you might think
  that the two</span> <span m=''2235000''>bright spots on the slit will be about 0.02
  inches apart.</span> </p><p><span m=''2241000''>Well, of course, that isn''t the
  case.</span> </p><p><span m=''2245000''>What you really see is an array of bright
  spots.</span> </p><p><span m=''2251000''>And Christine has up there in the projection
  booth a helium</span> <span m=''2256000''>neon laser that is shinning behind two
  slits.</span> </p><p><span m=''2259000''>You''ve got really beautifully now, Christine.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2263000''>That is great. And what you see is that there</span>
  <span m=''2267000''>is a whole array of spots. There aren''t just two spots.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2272000''>There is a bunch of spots here, bright spot,</span> <span
  m=''2275000''>dark spot, bright spot, dark spot.</span> </p><p><span m=''2280000''>You''ve
  also got another pattern superimposed on that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2285000''>It
  almost looks like you would see the single slit diffraction,</span> <span m=''2291000''>too,
  on top of the double slit, but we won''t get into that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2297000''>But
  this is not just two spots. Let''s see if we can try to</span> <span m=''2302000''>understand
  how this pattern arises, what this pattern comes</span> <span m=''2308000''>from.
  Well, waves have the property</span> <span m=''2312000''>of superposition. Superposition
  means that if I</span> <span m=''2317000''>take a wave and have it in space, but
  now I take a second</span> <span m=''2322000''>wave and put it in the same place
  in space but make it such</span> <span m=''2328000''>that the maxima of both waves
  are in the identical place in</span> <span m=''2333000''>space, what I have is a
  situation where the two waves</span> <span m=''2338000''>add that property of addition
  of waves --</span> <span m=''2344000''>When they are in the same place in space,
  that property is</span> <span m=''2348000''>called superposition. That is the property
  of waves.</span> </p><p><span m=''2351000''>And in this particular case, we are
  going to have what we</span> <span m=''2355000''>call constructive interference.
  They are going to add up such</span> <span m=''2360000''>that the amplitude here
  of the resulting wave is going to be</span> <span m=''2364000''>twice the amplitude
  of each of the individual waves.</span> </p><p><span m=''2369000''>This is constructive
  interference.</span> </p><p><span m=''2371000''>On the other hand, I can have two
  waves in the</span> <span m=''2374000''>same place in space, but they can be positioned
  so</span> <span m=''2377000''>that the maximum of one wave is at the same point
  in space as</span> <span m=''2381000''>the minimum of the other. And because we
  have these</span> <span m=''2385000''>positive and negative amplitudes, well,</span>
  <span m=''2387000''>then these are going to cancel when they add up and we are</span>
  <span m=''2391000''>going to have the null result. We are going to have no</span>
  <span m=''2395000''>intensity. That is called destructive</span> <span m=''2397000''>interference.
  Well, in order to understand</span> <span m=''2403000''>how this property of interference
  gives rise to these</span> <span m=''2408000''>array of bright spots in the two
  slit experiment,</span> <span m=''2413000''>let me actually use water waves as an
  example to try to</span> <span m=''2419000''>understand why we get this array of
  spots, or this row of bright</span> <span m=''2426000''>spots and dark spots. Here
  is the beach.</span> </p><p><span m=''2431000''>Here is the water. This is the top
  view.</span> </p><p><span m=''2435000''>Here is the water. Here is the sand.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2439000''>Here is where I wanted to be all weekend.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2443000''>And the waves are rolling in to the shore.</span> </p><p><span m=''2447000''>There
  are the wave fronts. And then suppose I get</span> <span m=''2451000''>ambitious
  and, for whatever perverse reason,</span> <span m=''2456000''>I decide to build
  a barrier to prevent these waves from coming</span> <span m=''2462000''>onto the
  beach. Except I poke two holes in the</span> <span m=''2467000''>barrier, two little
  holes. Well, you know what is going to</span> <span m=''2471000''>happen. When the
  wave approaches that</span> <span m=''2473000''>barrier, well, through that little
  hole a</span> <span m=''2476000''>little bit of the wave is going to sneak through.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2479000''>And because that little hole is really pretty little,</span>
  <span m=''2483000''>what is going to happen is that the wave front is going to</span>
  <span m=''2487000''>spread out isotropically. And so that wave front is going</span>
  <span m=''2492000''>to look like a semicircle centered on that little hole.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2496000''>And, of course, this wave front is going to</span> <span
  m=''2500000''>keep propagating. And it propagates out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2503000''>And
  then soon enough, a wavelength later,</span> <span m=''2506000''>another wave sneaks
  through and I have two semi-circles.</span> </p><p><span m=''2510000''>And the distance
  between those two semi-circles is lambda.</span> </p><p><span m=''2515000''>That
  is the wavelength. That is the wave crest.</span> </p><p><span m=''2520000''>That
  is the maximum of the wave.</span> </p><p><span m=''2522000''>Keep going. That propagates
  out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2524000''>Keep going. That propagates out.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2526000''>Well, at the same time that the waves are sneaking out through</span>
  <span m=''2531000''>that little hole, waves are sneaking out through</span> <span
  m=''2534000''>this little hole. And I will color them green.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2538000''>That wave propagates out and keeps propagating.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2541000''>The other one sneaks through and keeps propagating.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2545000''>And now let me clean up the drawing a little bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2550000''>And I am going to call this slit one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2552000''>The
  green waves are the waves that have come through slit one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2557000''>The
  blue waves are the ones that have come through slit two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2561000''>And
  the distance between any two successive maxima here,</span> <span m=''2565000''>or
  any two semi-circles is, of course, lambda.</span> </p><p><span m=''2569000''>And
  lambda is the same for slit one and slit two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2572000''>Now,
  I want you to look at this spot that I just circled right</span> <span m=''2577000''>here.
  Right here what do you see?</span> </p><p><span m=''2580000''>Interference. Absolutely.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2582000''>You have two maxima at the same place in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2585000''>You are going to have constructive interference right</span>
  <span m=''2589000''>there. What about this spot?</span> </p><p><span m=''2591000''>Constructive
  interference. What about this spot?</span> </p><p><span m=''2594000''>Right. Everywhere
  along that line you</span> <span m=''2596000''>are going to have constructive interference.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2599000''>Now, let me just tell you one other thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2602000''>We have every constructive interference all along this</span> <span
  m=''2606000''>line. Now look right at this point</span> <span m=''2610000''>here.
  What you see is you have the</span> <span m=''2613000''>superposition of the blue
  wave that has come from slit two,</span> <span m=''2618000''>and this blue wave
  has traveled out from slit two a distance</span> <span m=''2623000''>four lambda.
  One, two, three,</span> <span m=''2625000''>four lambda. That is the radius.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2628000''>It has traveled out a distance four lambda.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2632000''>It is constructively interfering with a wave coming</span> <span m=''2636000''>from
  slit one that has traveled out a distance three lambda.</span> </p><p><span m=''2643000''>One,
  two, three. The difference in the distance</span> <span m=''2646000''>traveled by
  those two waves that are constructively interfering</span> <span m=''2651000''>is
  one lambda. Let''s keep going in order to</span> <span m=''2655000''>understand
  this diagram. Let''s look at this spot.</span> </p><p><span m=''2658000''>Right
  here, what do you have? Constructive interference.</span> </p><p><span m=''2663000''>Right
  here you have constructive interference.</span> </p><p><span m=''2667000''>If you
  kept going you would see, everywhere along this line,</span> <span m=''2671000''>constructive
  interference. Now let''s look at the</span> <span m=''2676000''>difference in the
  distance traveled by the waves that are</span> <span m=''2680000''>constructively
  interfering along that line.</span> </p><p><span m=''2683000''>Well, you see the
  green wave here?</span> </p><p><span m=''2686000''>The wave that is constructively
  interfering is one that has</span> <span m=''2690000''>traveled out a distance two
  lambda.</span> </p><p><span m=''2693000''>That is, r sub one is equal to two lambda.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2696000''>It is interfering with this wave front</span> <span m=''2700000''>that
  has traveled out a distance four lambda.</span> </p><p><span m=''2705000''>The difference
  in the distance traveled by those two waves is</span> <span m=''2709000''>two lambda.
  4 lambda minus 2 lambda equals</span> <span m=''2711000''>2 lambda. I think on your
  notes,</span> <span m=''2713000''>it is actually this case that I have written it
  down.</span> </p><p><span m=''2717000''>Here is another point of constructive interference.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2720000''>Here is another point of constructive interference.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2724000''>Everywhere along this line, we have constructive</span>
  <span m=''2727000''>interference. And, if you analyze this,</span> <span m=''2731000''>the
  difference in the distance traveled would be zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2735000''>What
  you would expect, if you were to image this,</span> <span m=''2739000''>you''d expect
  right here very bright spot, very bright spot,</span> <span m=''2743000''>very bright
  spot. This is going to be symmetric</span> <span m=''2747000''>around the center,
  so there will be a bright spot</span> <span m=''2751000''>out here, a bright spot
  out there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2754000''>Let''s look at this actually in real
  life in a water tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''2760000''>There we go, up here on
  the side boards.</span> </p><p><span m=''2763000''>Here are the waves coming this
  way onto some barrier,</span> <span m=''2769000''>and here are the holes. Here is
  one hole.</span> </p><p><span m=''2773000''>Here is the other hole. And then these
  bright</span> <span m=''2777000''>semi-circles are the wave fronts.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2781000''>And what I want you to notice, and you have to kind of look</span>
  <span m=''2787000''>out here, right there you see a whole bunch of very bright</span>
  <span m=''2792000''>spots. Well, if this were light and we</span> <span m=''2797000''>had
  a screen then right here we would see the screen light up.</span> </p><p><span m=''2801000''>And
  then right here you see kind of nothing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2804000''>That
  nothing is destructive interference.</span> </p><p><span m=''2807000''>That would
  be a dark spot if, in fact, this were light and we</span> <span m=''2812000''>were
  looking at a screen. Then here is another very</span> <span m=''2815000''>bright
  spot. Here is another very bright</span> <span m=''2818000''>spot. This is on a
  website from the</span> <span m=''2822000''>University of Colorado, which, if you
  are not familiar</span> <span m=''2827000''>with, is actually kind of a very neat
  website.</span> </p><p><span m=''2831000''>It has some very elementary topics in
  it,</span> <span m=''2835000''>but it also has some topics that even you would be</span>
  <span m=''2839000''>interested in. And that is actually the name</span> <span m=''2843000''>of
  the website. And so what is going on here,</span> <span m=''2847000''>in the case
  of the light, is just what we have explained.</span> </p><p><span m=''2854000''>We''ve
  got this line of constructive interference that</span> <span m=''2857000''>is going
  to result on the screen as a very bright spot.</span> </p><p><span m=''2861000''>And
  then another line with another bright spot and another</span> <span m=''2865000''>line
  with a very bright spot. And this is symmetric around</span> <span m=''2869000''>the
  zero. Right at this point we have</span> <span m=''2872000''>constructive interference.
  In between we have destructive</span> <span m=''2876000''>interference. Constructive,</span>
  <span m=''2878000''>destructive, constructive.</span> </p><p><span m=''2880000''>And
  that is the origin of the many different bright spots.</span> </p><p><span m=''2885000''>And
  now there is a condition that has to obtain in order for</span> <span m=''2889000''>there
  to be maximum constructive interference,</span> <span m=''2892000''>and that is
  this condition. The difference in the distance</span> <span m=''2897000''>traveled
  of the two waves that are interfering to give us that</span> <span m=''2901000''>maximum
  constructive interference has to be an</span> <span m=''2905000''>integral multiple
  of the wavelength.</span> </p><p><span m=''2909000''>I will explain this a little
  bit more starting on Wednesday.</span> </p><p><span m=''2913000''>Okay. See you
  then.</span> </p>'
