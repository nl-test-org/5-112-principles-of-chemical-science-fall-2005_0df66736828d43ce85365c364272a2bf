  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Onto today's topic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='53000'>Today we are going to be focusing on issues associated</span>
  <span m='56000'>with oxidation-reduction half-reactions.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>And
  I want you think back to my first lecture,</span> <span m='63000'>where I really
  talked a lot about how unifying the concepts</span> <span m='67000'>were that stemmed
  from the ideas of Gilbert Newton Lewis,</span> <span m='72000'>because we talked
  about acid-base, donor-acceptor,</span> <span m='76000'>electrophile-neucleophile,
  and oxidant-reductant all as</span> <span m='80000'>parallel concepts, with the
  related theme there</span> <span m='83000'>being what is going on with the electrons
  in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='89000'>And it is really important to consider
  not simply the</span> <span m='93000'>reactions that occur between molecules, but
  also the</span> <span m='97000'>reactions that occur when electrons coming from
  molecules</span> <span m='102000'>or coming from ions or coming from metals are
  connected up in</span> <span m='107000'>some kind of external circuit that can be
  interfaced then to</span> <span m='112000'>some real world problems through the
  mechanism of</span> <span m='116000'>electrochemistry. And so we will talk today
  about</span> <span m='121000'>some of the basic concepts that you will need.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124000'>This will be the equipment that you can use to do future</span>
  <span m='129000'>research to solve the world's energy problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='132000'>This is going to be good. And it is pretty</span> <span m='136000'>straightforward.
  I want to give you an example</span> <span m='139000'>of a reaction that can be
  decomposed into half-reactions.</span> </p><p><span m='143000'>And that is the reaction
  of magnesium metal with carbon</span> <span m='148000'>dioxide. And this will be
  two</span> <span m='151000'>equivalence of magnesium going to two magnesium O two
  plus</span> <span m='157000'>elemental carbon.</span> </p><p><span m='161000'>Now,
  this actually is an important reaction in that it</span> <span m='166000'>contains
  one molecule carbon dioxide, that is really a</span> <span m='172000'>critical energy
  and environment molecule that we worry a lot</span> <span m='177000'>about today.
  I will emphasize this in a few</span> <span m='182000'>points during my lecture
  today, but we want to be able to find</span> <span m='186000'>ways of producing
  energy that don't simultaneously produce a</span> <span m='191000'>whole lot of
  CO two that goes up into the atmosphere and</span> <span m='195000'>is a greenhouse
  gas. And so we will talk about that.</span> </p><p><span m='199000'>I would like
  you to just start thinking in the background of</span> <span m='203000'>your mind
  right now about the molecules, if you can list them,</span> <span m='208000'>that
  are really important to energy concerns today.</span> </p><p><span m='213000'>With
  this reaction, we can decompose this into the</span> <span m='218000'>following
  half-reactions. We can see that it can be</span> <span m='224000'>written as carbon
  dioxide plus four electrons plus four protons</span> <span m='231000'>going to carbon
  plus two H two O.</span> </p><p><span m='240000'>And then simultaneously we can
  also write two magnesium plus</span> <span m='246000'>two H two O going to magnesium
  two equivalence O plus four H</span> <span m='252000'>plus plus four electrons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='257000'>Although the reaction that one may actually</span> <span
  m='263000'>carry out would be the one on top here, that reaction can be</span> <span
  m='269000'>separated out into the parts that are associated with</span> <span m='274000'>oxidation
  and the parts that are associated with reduction.</span> </p><p><span m='282000'>And
  so, down here in equation one, we see that CO two</span> <span m='288000'>is undergoing
  reduction by four electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='292000'>This is a four electron
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='296000'>And down here, in equation two,</span> <span
  m='298000'>what we are seeing is that this magnesium metal is ultimately</span>
  <span m='304000'>serving as a source of four electrons in that process,</span> <span
  m='309000'>each magnesium going to magnesium two plus.</span> </p><p><span m='314000'>There
  is implied, here, that we are going to be</span> <span m='318000'>able to know something
  also about oxidation states.</span> </p><p><span m='324000'>And so, as we talk about
  oxidation-reduction processes,</span> <span m='327000'>I want you to also, if necessary,</span>
  <span m='330000'>review about what you know about the assignment of</span> <span
  m='333000'>oxidation states in systems. But by writing this out,</span> <span m='337000'>you
  can see that on the left side of equation one,</span> <span m='340000'>electrons
  are going in. And on the right side of</span> <span m='344000'>equation two electrons
  are coming out.</span> </p><p><span m='346000'>And, really, if you can keep track
  of what</span> <span m='349000'>the supply of the electrons are and where the demand
  is for the</span> <span m='353000'>electrons in the overall system, you will really
  have a good</span> <span m='358000'>feeling for how these processes physically may
  be taking place.</span> </p><p><span m='364000'>And then, up here on top, this is
  the sum of those two</span> <span m='369000'>equations, one plus two. And that is
  typical of how we</span> <span m='374000'>write oxidation-reduction half-reactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='378000'>And when we consider a pair of half-reactions,</span> <span
  m='382000'>one of the things that we are really interested in is the</span> <span
  m='387000'>potential difference.</span> </p><p><span m='401000'>And that is to say
  if we have some way, physically,</span> <span m='405000'>of sequestering the two
  individual half-reactions into</span> <span m='411000'>different containers, and
  if we allow them to</span> <span m='415000'>communicate, but we don't allow the
  reaction to proceed to any</span> <span m='421000'>significant extent, we can measure
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='432000'>We can measure it when the reaction is not
  allowed to</span> <span m='435000'>proceed to a significant extent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='447000'>And the reason for that latter caveat is that when you put into</span>
  <span m='452000'>communication two sequestered cells that are each poised,</span>
  <span m='457000'>one to undergo a reduction and one to undergo an oxidation,</span>
  <span m='462000'>then if you put them into contact and let that reaction</span>
  <span m='467000'>start to proceed, you can see that that reaction</span> <span m='471000'>would
  proceed until such time as equilibrium is reached.</span> </p><p><span m='477000'>And
  so all throughout that process, the potential</span> <span m='480000'>difference
  between the two would be changing until it stops</span> <span m='484000'>changing.
  And when it stops changing,</span> <span m='487000'>we would have reached equilibrium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='490000'>The two independent half-reactions at the beginning</span>
  <span m='493000'>have their own potential, the degree to which they are</span> <span
  m='497000'>poised to undergo oxidation or reduction.</span> </p><p><span m='500000'>And
  then, how do we do this? Well, you are going to see that</span> <span m='507000'>we
  can use a thing called a salt bridge.</span> </p><p><span m='512000'>And with a
  salt bridge, we can allow for not only</span> <span m='518000'>communication of
  the electrons from one of the half-reaction</span> <span m='526000'>cells to the
  other, but we are also going to need</span> <span m='532000'>to allow for the movement
  of ions.</span> </p><p><span m='536000'>This permits ion movement.</span> </p><p><span
  m='546000'>And this requirement for ion movement stems from the</span> <span m='551000'>necessity
  to maintain electroneutrality,</span> <span m='555000'>charge neutrality in each
  of the two cells that we have,</span> <span m='560000'>each of the two compartments
  of the electrochemical cell that we</span> <span m='567000'>are going to create.
  And in reference to</span> <span m='571000'>electrochemical cells, --</span> <span
  m='585000'>-- there are lots of different types of electrochemical cells.</span>
  </p><p><span m='589000'>And today we are going to be discussing two of these in</span>
  <span m='593000'>particular. We are going to start out by</span> <span m='596000'>talking
  about what is called a Galvanic cell.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>And then, I
  am going to talk about how you can use Galvanic</span> <span m='604000'>cells to
  measure standard properties of</span> <span m='607000'>oxidation-reduction half-reactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='609000'>And then, after we do that, we are going to talk about the</span>
  <span m='614000'>properties of redox-active systems.</span> </p><p><span m='616000'>And
  then, finally, I will finish up by talking</span> <span m='620000'>about another
  type of electrochemical cell,</span> <span m='623000'>and this will be an electrolytic
  cell.</span> </p><p><span m='626000'>So, let's look at a Galvanic cell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='652000'>Last week I left my blue chalk in here.</span> </p><p><span m='656000'>Gone.
  Oh, well.</span> </p><p><span m='657000'>Down one color. If anyone can find that
  blue</span> <span m='661000'>chalk for me, I will be very appreciative.</span> </p><p><span
  m='683000'>As I have been alluding to, we can set up an</span> <span m='686000'>electrochemical
  cell. In this case,</span> <span m='689000'>called the Galvanic cell, in which we
  sequestered two</span> <span m='693000'>different half-reactions to the different
  compartments.</span> </p><p><span m='698000'>And then we are going need for a control
  of the communication</span> <span m='705000'>between the two compartments. And we
  will do that in the</span> <span m='712000'>following way. What I am representing,</span>
  <span m='717000'>here, is a piece of metallic zinc.</span> </p><p><span m='723000'>And
  the way I have drawn it, it is supposed to be like a</span> <span m='728000'>simple
  strip of zinc metal, to which we could attach some</span> <span m='734000'>alligator
  clips and can run an external piece of wire over to</span> <span m='740000'>the
  other side. And we can interpose,</span> <span m='744000'>here, some kind of a meter.
  This round unit,</span> <span m='749000'>here, could be either a volt meter or an
  ammeter to measure,</span> <span m='753000'>respectively, voltage or current,</span>
  <span m='756000'>in a system like this. And then, over on the other</span> <span
  m='760000'>side, we will have a different electrode.</span> </p><p><span m='772000'>And
  this electrode will be made of metallic copper.</span> </p><p><span m='780000'>And
  I have got to have my salt bridge so that we can maintain</span> <span m='786000'>electroneutrality
  in these solutions that we are going to</span> <span m='793000'>have on both sides
  in the two separate compartments.</span> </p><p><span m='798000'>So, there is my
  salt bridge. And this might contain an</span> <span m='804000'>electrolyte, such
  as potassium nitrate.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>And that electrolyte would
  be suspended in a gelatinous medium</span> <span m='815000'>like agar, for example.
  And what we are going to be</span> <span m='820000'>interested in will be the directionality
  of the electron</span> <span m='824000'>flow in a system like this. We are going
  to be interested</span> <span m='830000'>in the potential that gets set up when
  the electrons flow in a</span> <span m='835000'>system like this. And we are going
  to want to</span> <span m='840000'>know which side is the anode and which side is
  the cathode,</span> <span m='844000'>and what are the equations for the reactions
  that are taking</span> <span m='848000'>place at the side that is the anode and
  at the side that is</span> <span m='853000'>the cathode. Let's look at that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='855000'>Let me just point out that if I had blue, I would be indicating</span>
  <span m='860000'>the aqueous solution here in blue.</span> </p><p><span m='862000'>Maybe
  those of you who are colorblind will think that is</span> <span m='866000'>blue,
  but anyway. The idea is that we have an</span> <span m='871000'>aqueous solution
  here, on both sides.</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>And this one, over on the right,</span>
  <span m='876000'>is going to start off with some concentration of copper two</span>
  <span m='880000'>ions --</span> <span m='889000'>-- in solution. So, some molarity
  of copper two</span> <span m='892000'>will be present in the solution over here
  on the</span> <span m='896000'>right-hand side, where we have the copper</span>
  <span m='898000'>electrode. Inside the salt bridge,</span> <span m='901000'>we have
  potassium cations and nitrate anions that can go into</span> <span m='907000'>solution
  on either side to balance the charged changes that</span> <span m='912000'>are taking
  place as oxidation-reduction reactions</span> <span m='916000'>happen on the left-hand
  side and on the right-hand side of this</span> <span m='921000'>electrochemical
  cell, which is a Galvanic cell.</span> </p><p><span m='925000'>And so, what we find
  is that you let this go into contact</span> <span m='930000'>briefly. And you would
  measure,</span> <span m='934000'>for this cell, 1.1 volts.</span> </p><p><span m='936000'>And
  so, that is the magnitude of the potential difference</span> <span m='942000'>between
  the two half-reactions that are present on both sides</span> <span m='949000'>of
  the cell. And, furthermore,</span> <span m='952000'>we would see that the electrons
  are starting out over here,</span> <span m='958000'>and they are going this way
  around the circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='965000'>And that tells us that what we
  have on the left electrode at</span> <span m='972000'>zinc is going to be called
  our anode.</span> </p><p><span m='977000'>That is because at the anode, --</span>
  <span m='989000'>-- oxidation is taking place because metallic zinc is</span> <span
  m='994000'>undergoing oxidation and becoming zinc two plus</span> <span m='999000'>and
  providing, in so doing,</span> <span m='1003000'>two electrons for every zinc that
  gets oxidized.</span> </p><p><span m='1008000'>What you can think of as happening
  over here on the side</span> <span m='1014000'>that we call the anode is that you
  have this piece of zinc</span> <span m='1020000'>metal. And, in order for electrons
  to</span> <span m='1024000'>start coming out to the external circuit, for every
  two electrons</span> <span m='1030000'>that comes around to the outside of the circuit,</span>
  <span m='1034000'>you have a single zinc two plus ion that jumps into</span> <span
  m='1040000'>solution. A piece of zinc jumps off of</span> <span m='1043000'>the
  surface of the electrode. That zinc atom leaves as the</span> <span m='1048000'>zinc
  two plus ion. That supplies two electrons to</span> <span m='1054000'>the external
  circuit. And, at the same time,</span> <span m='1058000'>to balance charge, we would
  have to have,</span> <span m='1062000'>from the salt bridge entering solution, two
  NO three minus,</span> <span m='1067000'>two nitrate anions,</span> <span m='1070000'>because
  they are singly charged, have to come out of the</span> <span m='1075000'>salt bridge
  and into solution every time a zinc two plus</span> <span m='1080000'>drops away
  from the electrode and starts flowing</span> <span m='1086000'>into the external
  circuit. And electrons go around the</span> <span m='1091000'>initial voltage when
  the reaction has not proceeded to</span> <span m='1095000'>any significant extent,
  is this 1.1 volts.</span> </p><p><span m='1098000'>So, we have measured the potential
  difference between the</span> <span m='1102000'>two half-reactions. Here is one
  of these</span> <span m='1104000'>half-reactions. At the other side,</span> <span
  m='1107000'>if on the left side we have an electrode that is the anode,</span> <span
  m='1111000'>then on the right-hand side we must have an electrode that is</span>
  <span m='1115000'>the cathode.</span> </p><p><span m='1124000'>And we must have
  reduction occurring there.</span> </p><p><span m='1127000'>And what is getting reduced?
  Well, as electrons appear down</span> <span m='1132000'>here at this electrode,
  they can encounter a copper two</span> <span m='1137000'>plus ion in solution that
  can then become part of the</span> <span m='1143000'>surface of the electrode as
  a copper metal atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1148000'>In other words, we are depleting
  the surface of</span> <span m='1151000'>this piece of metallic zinc over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1154000'>And zinc ions are going into solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1156000'>And, on the right-hand side, copper ions are coming from</span> <span
  m='1160000'>solution and becoming incorporated into the electrode</span> <span m='1164000'>itself.
  And so, if you ran this</span> <span m='1167000'>reaction for a while, and then
  you took the two</span> <span m='1171000'>pieces of metal, zinc and copper,</span>
  <span m='1173000'>that you had used to set up the Galvanic cell,</span> <span m='1177000'>you
  could weigh them. And you could see that the zinc</span> <span m='1181000'>electrode
  would have gotten lighter, and the copper</span> <span m='1184000'>electrode would
  have gotten heavier.</span> </p><p><span m='1187000'>And so, that is also the basis
  for the technique of</span> <span m='1191000'>electroplating, where you can take
  one metal</span> <span m='1194000'>and cover over the surface of it with a thin
  layer of another</span> <span m='1199000'>metal. Here we are just putting a new</span>
  <span m='1203000'>layer of copper on the surface of this copper electrode,</span>
  <span m='1207000'>and we are depleting what we call, over on the left,</span> <span
  m='1211000'>the sacrificial zinc anode. And this reaction then,</span> <span m='1215000'>over
  on the right-hand side, is copper two plus plus two</span> <span m='1219000'>electrons
  going to copper metal.</span> </p><p><span m='1224000'>So, that is a prototypical
  example of a Galvanic cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>And in setting that
  up and thinking about what is happening</span> <span m='1236000'>there, in terms
  of depletion of one electrode so that the other</span> <span m='1242000'>one can
  be increased in mass, you may be aware that you know</span> <span m='1248000'>of
  places where this principle is actually used.</span> </p><p><span m='1253000'>In
  construction, for example,</span> <span m='1256000'>there are large steel bridges
  that are constructed.</span> </p><p><span m='1263000'>And one does not want those
  to oxidize away and to become</span> <span m='1267000'>fragile in their structure,
  so that bridges break down and</span> <span m='1271000'>bridges are not safe anymore,
  shall we say.</span> </p><p><span m='1275000'>And so, what is often done there is
  large pieces of zinc,</span> <span m='1279000'>actually, are put into electrical
  contact with the</span> <span m='1283000'>metal of the bridge so that it is the
  zinc that actually gets</span> <span m='1287000'>oxidized away as a sacrificial
  anode, instead of the bridge</span> <span m='1292000'>itself. The same for any of
  you who are</span> <span m='1296000'>sailors or boaters in general. You probably
  know that zinc</span> <span m='1300000'>anodes are present usually in several places
  on boats so that</span> <span m='1305000'>electrolysis does not occur and corrode
  away the metal parts of</span> <span m='1309000'>your boat. Instead, the zinc sacrificial</span>
  <span m='1312000'>anode is oxidized away and is a source of electrons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1316000'>So, that is an important principle.</span> </p><p><span m='1330000'>Once
  you have started looking at some different kinds of</span> <span m='1333000'>oxidation-reduction
  half-reactions,</span> <span m='1336000'>you are going to want to know just how
  oxidizing is something</span> <span m='1340000'>or just how reducing is something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1342000'>And, in order to do this, we need to pick one particular</span>
  <span m='1346000'>half-reaction that will serve as our universal standard.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1351000'>And, to that half-reaction, we will compare everything</span>
  <span m='1354000'>else. And so, that brings us to the</span> <span m='1357000'>discussion
  of standard reduction potentials, or standard</span> <span m='1360000'>potentials.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1377000'>For this, I am going to make another Galvanic cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1400000'>And, concerning this Galvanic cell, we will have a number
  of</span> <span m='1403000'>the same questions that we have had before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1406000'>But the one that we are going to be using on the right-hand</span> <span
  m='1410000'>side is going to be very special.</span> </p><p><span m='1413000'>Here
  we indicate our water line, again, in green.</span> </p><p><span m='1419000'>And
  I am going to put in a salt bridge into the system.</span> </p><p><span m='1427000'>And
  I will have an electrode, here, on the left and another</span> <span m='1436000'>electrode
  over here on the right.</span> </p><p><span m='1447000'>We will connect up these
  electrode using alligator clips.</span> </p><p><span m='1450000'>We will need an
  external circuit with a meter,</span> <span m='1454000'>so we will be able to compare
  the potential of the two</span> <span m='1457000'>half-reactions of interest. But
  then, over here on the</span> <span m='1461000'>right, this electrode is going to
  be a little different.</span> </p><p><span m='1465000'>Because this one is going
  to have something like a test-tube</span> <span m='1469000'>inverted over it --
  -- because the reaction that we</span> <span m='1475000'>will talk about here, in
  fact, does involve a gas.</span> </p><p><span m='1479000'>And that gas is hydrogen,
  another one of our important</span> <span m='1485000'>energy molecules to be talking
  about in the context of today's</span> <span m='1491000'>lecture. At the end, I
  would like to see</span> <span m='1495000'>if you have a list of energy molecules
  collected from today's</span> <span m='1501000'>lecture. But also, we are going
  to</span> <span m='1505000'>choose, as the electrode material, here,</span> <span
  m='1508000'>this metal piece of electrode material.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>This
  is going to be platinum. And the reason we are going to</span> <span m='1517000'>choose
  platinum, a very common electrode</span> <span m='1520000'>material, is that platinum
  is a so-called noble metal.</span> </p><p><span m='1531000'>And that means that
  it is quite impervious to most chemical</span> <span m='1535000'>reactions. Over
  there, we were talking</span> <span m='1537000'>about zinc and copper electrodes
  that themselves do change during</span> <span m='1541000'>the reaction. And over
  here,</span> <span m='1543000'>we want to have a piece of metal that can provide
  the</span> <span m='1547000'>valuable function of giving us electrical contact of
  the</span> <span m='1551000'>chemical reactions on the two sides, but an electrode
  that</span> <span m='1555000'>will remain clean and unchanged at its surface throughout
  the</span> <span m='1559000'>course of the reaction. So, we use a platinum electrode</span>
  <span m='1564000'>over here. And you can see that with this</span> <span m='1567000'>inverted
  test tube through which the wire passes and with some</span> <span m='1572000'>kind
  of a provision for a side arm attachment here,</span> <span m='1576000'>we can hook
  up a cylinder of H two gas.</span> </p><p><span m='1580000'>And we can start bubbling
  H two over this electrode,</span> <span m='1585000'>like this, so that it actually
  will have bubbles of H two</span> <span m='1590000'>coming out like that. In fact,
  this solution over</span> <span m='1595000'>here will be saturated with H two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1600000'>And a further consideration for our reference electrode,</span>
  <span m='1606000'>which is going to be known as the standard hydrogen electrode,</span>
  <span m='1612000'>or SHE.</span> </p><p><span m='1626000'>That is, the electrode
  against which everything else is going</span> <span m='1632000'>to be compared.
  And it also has,</span> <span m='1635000'>in the solution here, 1.0 molar H three
  O plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>So, indeed, it is a very</span> <span m='1643000'>strongly
  acidic medium. And what we are measuring,</span> <span m='1649000'>over on the right-hand
  side, is a half reaction that may</span> <span m='1655000'>correspond either to
  two H plus plus two electrons going to</span> <span m='1661000'>H two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1664000'>And that will be the case if this side is the cathode.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1669000'>But if this side turns out to be the anode,</span> <span m='1673000'>then
  we would be measuring the opposite reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1680000'>And
  I will talk more about that in a second.</span> </p><p><span m='1683000'>Let's say,
  for example, that our electrode over here</span> <span m='1688000'>is, in fact,
  made of zinc.</span> </p><p><span m='1699000'>If our electrode over here is made
  of zinc.</span> </p><p><span m='1702000'>And we may have zinc two plus in solution,</span>
  <span m='1707000'>here, and we may again have something like potassium nitrate</span>
  <span m='1712000'>or some other electrolyte present in our salt</span> <span m='1717000'>bridge.
  Then what we can do is put</span> <span m='1721000'>these things briefly into contact.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1723000'>And we want to know two things. We want to know what the</span>
  <span m='1728000'>magnitude of the potential difference is and what the</span> <span
  m='1732000'>direction in which the electrons are flowing is so that we know</span>
  <span m='1737000'>which one is the cathode and which one is the anode.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1742000'>And, in this particular case, the direction of electron flow</span>
  <span m='1747000'>is, as before, away from the zinc.</span> </p><p><span m='1750000'>Once
  again, zinc atoms are jumping off the surface of the</span> <span m='1756000'>electrode
  as zinc two plus ions.</span> </p><p><span m='1760000'>And, every time that happens,
  two electrons go into the</span> <span m='1765000'>external circuit and come around
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1770000'>And the chemical reaction that occurs here,
  in this case,</span> <span m='1774000'>is that those two electrons that came from
  one of the zinc</span> <span m='1778000'>atoms react, as shown here, with two H
  plus ions to make</span> <span m='1783000'>H two.</span> </p><p><span m='1785000'>And
  so, we know the direction of electron flow,</span> <span m='1789000'>we know the
  exact reactions that are taking place on the</span> <span m='1793000'>left and on
  the right. And we know that,</span> <span m='1797000'>for this particular choice
  of substances, our anode is on the</span> <span m='1802000'>left, and our cathode
  is on the right.</span> </p><p><span m='1806000'>And let me come over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1817000'>There is another way that I can write this cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1821000'>And so, I would like to introduce cell notation to you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1827000'>And that will be like this. We will have zinc.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1832000'>And then, a solid line. And then, zinc two plus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1841000'>And then, a solid double vertical line.</span> </p><p><span m='1848000'>And
  then, H plus, another solid vertical line,</span> <span m='1857000'>H two. And then
  another solid line.</span> </p><p><span m='1862000'>And then platinum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1867000'>That is the way I set that up.</span> </p><p><span m='1870000'>We could,
  actually, add another solid line here and</span> <span m='1875000'>put platinum
  over here. The thing that I want you to</span> <span m='1880000'>recognize about
  this notation for Galvanic cells is that the</span> <span m='1886000'>solid single
  lines represent interfaces, direct contacts</span> <span m='1891000'>between things.
  Here, it would be a platinum</span> <span m='1896000'>solid electrode connected
  with solid zinc,</span> <span m='1899000'>possibly. And then, the way I drew it</span>
  <span m='1903000'>over there, it would just be solid zinc, no platinum on the</span>
  <span m='1907000'>left. And then this solid line</span> <span m='1909000'>represents
  a solid liquid interface because the electrode</span> <span m='1913000'>is dipped
  into a solution that contains zinc two</span> <span m='1917000'>ions. And that is
  in communication</span> <span m='1920000'>with the other half of this electrochemical
  cell by a salt</span> <span m='1924000'>bridge. And the salt bridge is</span> <span
  m='1928000'>represented by the double vertical line.</span> </p><p><span m='1931000'>And
  then we have, in solution,</span> <span m='1934000'>protons. And then, a solid liquid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1937000'>Well, actually, in this case,</span> <span m='1940000'>a
  liquid gas interface to the gaseous H two.</span> </p><p><span m='1945000'>And H
  two is also dissolved.</span> </p><p><span m='1950000'>In order for this to be used
  as a reference electrode,</span> <span m='1954000'>we have to pick standard conditions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1958000'>And so, we are usually talking about one atmosphere of
  hydrogen</span> <span m='1963000'>for the standard hydrogen electrode.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1967000'>And we are talking about a concentration of 1.0 molar of</span> <span
  m='1972000'>our strong acid. And so, those are our standard</span> <span m='1976000'>conditions,
  along with 25 degrees C.</span> </p><p><span m='1981000'>And then this solution
  that contains the protons and the</span> <span m='1985000'>hydrogen gas is in a
  solution solid interface with the solid</span> <span m='1990000'>platinum electrode
  that is not going to be undergoing any</span> <span m='1994000'>change. So, these
  are the types of cell</span> <span m='1997000'>notations that you will encounter
  when looking into</span> <span m='2001000'>electrochemistry. And we found out that
  the left</span> <span m='2005000'>side, where the zinc metal is going to zinc two</span>
  <span m='2010000'>plus, is our anode.</span> </p><p><span m='2014000'>And also,
  the potential difference, when we measure it</span> <span m='2019000'>using our
  voltmeter right here by turning on the contact very</span> <span m='2025000'>briefly,
  is around 0.763 volts. So, that is the magnitude of</span> <span m='2031000'>our
  potential difference. And this is equal to delta E</span> <span m='2036000'>zero
  cell. When I write E zero,</span> <span m='2042000'>that means standard potential.
  And this is written as a delta</span> <span m='2048000'>here because that is the
  difference between the</span> <span m='2052000'>potentials for the two half-reactions
  that we have</span> <span m='2057000'>written up there. But it is a very simple</span>
  <span m='2060000'>difference precisely because the standard hydrogen electrode is</span>
  <span m='2066000'>our reference electrode. Over here we want to write the</span>
  <span m='2072000'>definition of standard cell potential.</span> </p><p><span m='2107000'>And
  that is a delta E zero for your cell is equal to delta E</span> <span m='2114000'>zero
  for your cathode minus-- Sorry, this is not delta here.</span> </p><p><span m='2121000'>Just
  E zero for your cathode minus E zero for your anode.</span> </p><p><span m='2140000'>But
  E zero for the standard hydrogen electrode,</span> <span m='2144000'>because this
  is our reference electrode, is equal to zero at</span> <span m='2149000'>all temperatures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2156000'>And that is by definition. So, the standard potential for</span>
  <span m='2162000'>that set of conditions that constitutes our standard</span> <span
  m='2168000'>hydrogen electrode is taken as the zero of potential for</span> <span
  m='2174000'>comparison with any other type of half cell that you might be</span>
  <span m='2181000'>able to consider. And so, we can see further</span> <span m='2185000'>that,
  in this particular case, where we have our cathode as</span> <span m='2192000'>the
  standard hydrogen electrode, we have zero and minus E zero</span> <span m='2199000'>for
  the anode, which we measured as 0</span> <span m='2205000'>volts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2213000'>That means that for the reaction zinc going to zinc two</span> <span
  m='2217000'>plus plus two electrons,</span> <span m='2221000'>which is our anodic
  reaction, we have a standard potential of</span> <span m='2226000'>-0.763 volts.
  And generally,</span> <span m='2229000'>what you are going to be interested in,</span>
  <span m='2232000'>as you consider different kinds of substances from throughout</span>
  <span m='2237000'>the periodic table with reference to their ability to</span> <span
  m='2241000'>take place in oxidation-reduction reactions,</span> <span m='2245000'>is
  you are going to want to know what your standard</span> <span m='2249000'>potential
  is. You are not going to always</span> <span m='2253000'>have a system that you
  want to consider that is under standard</span> <span m='2257000'>conditions. These
  standard potentials</span> <span m='2260000'>always are referenced to some standard
  conditions,</span> <span m='2263000'>as I mentioned specifically for the standard
  hydrogen electrode.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>And so, part of next lecture
  on Monday is we are going to show</span> <span m='2271000'>you how to handle systems
  that are not under standard</span> <span m='2274000'>conditions because then you
  can handle some real practical</span> <span m='2278000'>problems. But let's look
  at a different</span> <span m='2282000'>type of cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2290000'>Let's
  write down the following cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2320000'>This new cell that
  I have written the cell notation for,</span> <span m='2323000'>instead of drawing
  up the whole diagram of this Galvanic cell,</span> <span m='2328000'>happens to
  be one in which we have platinum electrodes on both</span> <span m='2332000'>sides.
  Here we have the silver |</span> <span m='2334000'>silver plus redox couple on the
  left-hand</span> <span m='2338000'>side. And we have the redox couple of</span>
  <span m='2342000'>H plus with H two on the right-hand side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2346000'>So, the right-hand side corresponds to the standard</span> <span m='2349000'>hydrogen
  electrode, and the left-hand side is a new</span> <span m='2353000'>redox couple,
  or a new half-reaction,</span> <span m='2356000'>that we want to compare to the
  standard hydrogen electrode so</span> <span m='2360000'>that we will know, on an
  absolute scale,</span> <span m='2363000'>where it falls relative to all the other
  half-reactions we</span> <span m='2367000'>might want to measure. And so, we want
  to know,</span> <span m='2371000'>which way do the electrons flow?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2379000'>And, in this case, it turns out that the direction</span> <span m='2383000'>of
  electron flow is this way. So, this is the opposite of</span> <span m='2388000'>what
  we talked about in the case of comparing zinc to the</span> <span m='2393000'>standard
  hydrogen electrode. Electron flow has been</span> <span m='2397000'>reversed. What
  that means is that this</span> <span m='2400000'>over here, the SHE is now our anode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2405000'>And now the silver-silver plus electrode is our</span>
  <span m='2411000'>cathode. And we want to know not only</span> <span m='2414000'>the
  direction of electron flow, the direction of electron flow</span> <span m='2420000'>tells
  us what is doing the reduction and what is doing the</span> <span m='2426000'>oxidation,
  but we also want to know the magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m='2432000'>And this
  one turns out to be, this delta E cell,</span> <span m='2437000'>is equal to 0.8
  volts. And, by the definition of</span> <span m='2443000'>standard cell potentials
  that I gave you over there,</span> <span m='2449000'>you can see that what we are
  getting now, because the</span> <span m='2455000'>electron flow is reversed, our
  sign is reversed,</span> <span m='2460000'>and so our E zero for the reaction Ag
  plus plus an</span> <span m='2466000'>electron going to silver is</span> <span m='2472000'>equal
  to 0.8 volts, positive.</span> </p><p><span m='2478000'>Notice that the zinc-zinc
  two plus couple was</span> <span m='2482000'>negative with respect to the standard
  hydrogen electrode,</span> <span m='2485000'>but because the electron flow is reversed
  for silver plus,</span> <span m='2489000'>silver redox couple, we now have a positive</span>
  <span m='2492000'>potential relative to the standard hydrogen electrode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2505000'>What would like to arrive at is a nice big table where
  we look</span> <span m='2511000'>at standard potential --</span> <span m='2521000'>--
  with reference to this standard hydrogen electrode,</span> <span m='2526000'>which
  is our zero of potential. And you will be able to find a</span> <span m='2532000'>table
  like this in your book. What we found is that zinc is</span> <span m='2537000'>down
  here at -0.763, so that was zinc-zinc two plus</span> <span m='2542000'>at a negative
  potential relative to hydrogen</span> <span m='2548000'>plus electrons. We found
  that up here at +0.8,</span> <span m='2553000'>we have the silver-silver plus redox
  couple.</span> </p><p><span m='2559000'>These are thermodynamic quantities, so you
  can look on a</span> <span m='2564000'>table of standard reduction potentials and
  you can tell</span> <span m='2569000'>which direction electrons will flow if you
  set up cells that</span> <span m='2574000'>involve those redox half-reactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2579000'>Another electrode that we used today was copper two plus</span>
  <span m='2584000'>combining with two electrons to give copper metal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2589000'>It turns out that one is</span> <span m='2593000'>positive also by about
  positive 0.3 volts.</span> </p><p><span m='2597000'>You see hydrogen is here and
  it reduces silver-silver plus.</span> </p><p><span m='2603000'>Hydrogen reduces
  silver plus to</span> <span m='2607000'>silver because it is up there. Zinc is down
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2612000'>Zinc also serves as an anode with respect
  to any one of those</span> <span m='2617000'>three because all of those three are
  at a potential positive</span> <span m='2621000'>relative to zinc on this scale
  of standard reduction</span> <span m='2625000'>potentials. You can also have some
  other</span> <span m='2629000'>potentials, like way down here at about -2.7 volts
  is the</span> <span m='2633000'>sodium-sodium plus redox couple,</span> <span m='2637000'>way
  down there at -2.7 That is why sodium is so much</span> <span m='2642000'>fun to
  heave into a body of water.</span> </p><p><span m='2645000'>I mean, it is fantastic.
  You get reduction of the</span> <span m='2649000'>protons to make hydrogen, which
  then explodes.</span> </p><p><span m='2653000'>So, this is fantastic. And some of
  you may know that</span> <span m='2657000'>there is an annual, and I am not recommending
  that</span> <span m='2661000'>you do this, by the way. You can see how negative
  the</span> <span m='2665000'>potential is down here. Metallic sodium is a very</span>
  <span m='2672000'>strong reducing agent, indeed.</span> </p><p><span m='2675000'>A
  very important reaction is up here at about +1.23 volts</span> <span m='2682000'>relative
  to the standard hydrogen electrode.</span> </p><p><span m='2688000'>And this important
  reaction is oxygen plus four H pus plus four</span> <span m='2696000'>electrons
  going to two H two O.</span> </p><p><span m='2711000'>So, this +1.23 volts is very
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='2714000'>In the time remaining, I am not going
  to be able to</span> <span m='2718000'>tell you about electrolysis. I believe next
  hour I will</span> <span m='2723000'>start off by talking about electrolysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2727000'>And, if you can do electrolysis using oxidizing and reducing</span>
  <span m='2731000'>equivalents that derive from photovoltaic cells,</span> <span
  m='2735000'>so you are converting sunlight into separated electron whole</span>
  <span m='2740000'>pairs, you can drive a reaction like this the other way and</span>
  <span m='2745000'>learn how to make oxygen from water, and ultimately also</span>
  <span m='2750000'>hydrogen from water. We will talk about that a</span> <span m='2754272'>little
  bit next time. Have a nice weekend.</span> </p>
