  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Over on the side board
  here, I want to show you a few</span> <span m='20000'>representation of the ethylene
  molecule that we were talking</span> <span m='26000'>about at the end of last hour.
  When you see representations of</span> <span m='32000'>molecules that appear throughout
  your textbook,</span> <span m='35000'>as well as in this class, I want you to see
  if you can</span> <span m='39000'>recognize just what property of the molecule it
  is that is being</span> <span m='44000'>represented. In this case here,</span> <span
  m='46000'>we have arbitrarily sized spheres that represent the two</span> <span
  m='50000'>carbon atoms and the four peripheral hydrogen atoms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='54000'>And then, what I have plotted around it is a see-through</span> <span
  m='58000'>representation of the electron density at a particular</span> <span m='62000'>isosurface
  value of 0.1 electrons per unit volume.</span> </p><p><span m='67000'>So, that is
  a representation. And we are going to be seeing a</span> <span m='71000'>number
  of different kinds of representations,</span> <span m='74000'>and you will need
  to be able to distinguish between them.</span> </p><p><span m='78000'>And, in particular,
  we were talking last time about</span> <span m='82000'>different kinds of bonds.
  We talked about sigma bonds</span> <span m='85000'>that were cylindrically symmetric
  about the internuclear</span> <span m='89000'>axis of the two atoms that are bonded
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='94000'>And we also talked about pi bonds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='96000'>And I brought up the pi bond in connection with the ethylene</span>
  <span m='100000'>molecule that we were just looking at a different</span> <span
  m='104000'>representation of. And so now, let me show you</span> <span m='107000'>what
  a pi bond can look like. Here is a representation of the</span> <span m='111000'>ethylene
  molecule. Again, I have arbitrarily sized</span> <span m='115000'>spheres that show
  us just where the nuclear positions are in</span> <span m='119000'>three-dimensional
  space. So, we are talking about the</span> <span m='124000'>equilibrium geometry
  of the ethylene molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='128000'>And what you see here is
  that if the molecule is lying in the</span> <span m='134000'>x,y-plane, then each
  of these carbons has a 2pz orbital that</span> <span m='139000'>has a positive lobe
  and a negative lobe,</span> <span m='143000'>respectively, above and below the plane
  of</span> <span m='146000'>the molecule. And so, normally,</span> <span m='150000'>when
  we talk about atomic orbitals, we can reference their</span> <span m='154000'>phase
  as either positive or negative.</span> </p><p><span m='157000'>And we often, in
  representations like this</span> <span m='160000'>one, associate the positive phase
  with one color,</span> <span m='164000'>here blue, and the negative phase with a
  different color,</span> <span m='168000'>here yellow. I can choose whatever colors
  I</span> <span m='171000'>want for those, but this is also a type of</span> <span
  m='175000'>isosurface. And it represents the in-phase</span> <span m='179000'>side-to-side
  overlap of the positive above the plane lobes</span> <span m='184000'>of the carbon
  2pz orbitals and the negative lobes below the</span> <span m='189000'>plane of the
  carbon 2pz orbitals experiencing side-to-side</span> <span m='194000'>overlap. And
  so you see the two</span> <span m='196000'>electrons that could be paired up, spin
  paired,</span> <span m='200000'>one spin up, one spin down in this pi bond,</span>
  <span m='204000'>are smeared out both above and below the plane</span> <span m='209000'>But
  there is no contribution at all to the electron density in</span> <span m='213000'>the
  plane from an orbital like this.</span> </p><p><span m='215000'>When we looked at
  electron density isosurfaces,</span> <span m='218000'>as we have done a few times
  in this class, what we are looking</span> <span m='222000'>at there is an isosurface
  corresponding to all of the</span> <span m='225000'>electrons in the molecule. And
  here, what we are looking</span> <span m='229000'>at is an orbital that can house
  just two electrons,</span> <span m='232000'>one spin up and one spin down, so we
  are focusing our</span> <span m='236000'>attention on a function that involves just
  two electrons</span> <span m='239000'>bonding in a pi bond that has, as a nodal
  surface,</span> <span m='242000'>the plane of the molecule. The plane that contains
  all six</span> <span m='248000'>of these nuclei, the two carbons and the four</span>
  <span m='252000'>hydrogens. We talked about nodal planes</span> <span m='255000'>last
  time. And the issue of nodal planes,</span> <span m='258000'>nodal surfaces, is
  going to be very important</span> <span m='262000'>in today's lecture. Let's go
  over here and start</span> <span m='266000'>talking about hybridization.</span>
  </p><p><span m='283000'>On this board last time, I gave you kind of a timeline,</span>
  <span m='286000'>where we talked about contributions to different</span> <span m='289000'>aspects
  of electronic structure theory for molecules by</span> <span m='293000'>different
  people, some of who were recognized</span> <span m='296000'>with Nobel Prizes, others
  who were not.</span> </p><p><span m='300000'>And one of those people, namely Linus
  Pauling,</span> <span m='304000'>who won two Nobel Prizes, not both in chemistry,</span>
  <span m='309000'>came up with this idea of hybridization to solve one of</span>
  <span m='314000'>the problems associated with atomic orbital nodes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='319000'>And let me work on this and illustrate this to you by taking</span> <span
  m='325000'>a pretty simple molecule that has only four atoms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='332000'>And this molecule is one that, in fact, we have seen before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='336000'>It is an example of a Lewis acid, so any discussion of</span> <span m='341000'>electronic
  structure of this BH three molecule better</span> <span m='346000'>come out with
  a description of why it is a Lewis acid.</span> </p><p><span m='350000'>But let
  me now point something out.</span> </p><p><span m='353000'>That is, if I make the
  direction that coincides with</span> <span m='357000'>this top B-H bond, the x-axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='361000'>And in the plane of the board, the y-axis perpendicular
  to it,</span> <span m='365000'>as shown. And then, of course,</span> <span m='368000'>the
  z-axis coming perpendicularly out of the plane</span> <span m='371000'>of the board.
  Linus Pauling recognized a</span> <span m='374000'>problem. And let me give these
  hydrogens</span> <span m='377000'>descriptors. I will make this one A,</span> <span
  m='380000'>this one labeled B, and this one labeled C.</span> </p><p><span m='385000'>And
  the problem is that we have a pz orbital with one positive</span> <span m='389000'>lobe
  coming out of the plane of the board, up here.</span> </p><p><span m='393000'>This
  would be where the blue lobe is.</span> </p><p><span m='396000'>And the yellow lobe
  would be back behind the plane of the</span> <span m='400000'>board, analogous to
  the pi bond that we just looked at up on the</span> <span m='405000'>screen. And
  what you will see is I can</span> <span m='408000'>draw it this way. I am rotating
  this planar BH</span> <span m='412000'>three molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='422000'>That
  allows me to draw the pz orbital in a way that you can</span> <span m='428000'>visualize.
  And the observation that I want</span> <span m='432000'>you to take away from this
  drawing is it has to do with the</span> <span m='439000'>relationship in space of
  the three hydrogen nuclei as an</span> <span m='445000'>important property of the
  2pz orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='450000'>What we can say is that these three
  hydrogens,</span> <span m='454000'>A, B, and C reside in the nodal plane of the
  2pz.</span> </p><p><span m='470000'>They lie in the 2pz nodal plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='480000'>That is, the 2pz on the boron. And the wave functions that</span> <span
  m='485000'>these hydrogens bring into the problem of the electronic</span> <span
  m='491000'>structure of the BH three molecule are spherically</span> <span m='496000'>symmetric.
  They are simply 1s orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='500000'>And so, if you draw
  one of them here, remember that a 1s orbital</span> <span m='506000'>is spherically
  symmetric. You can see that any positive</span> <span m='513000'>reinforcement that
  would occur by overlap here is equal and</span> <span m='520000'>opposite to the
  negative reinforcement that will occur</span> <span m='527000'>down here. And this
  is something that is</span> <span m='531000'>true whenever a hydrogen s orbital
  lies in a nodal plane.</span> </p><p><span m='538000'>There is no net overlap--</span>
  <span m='551000'>--between the boron's 2pz and the hydrogen 1s orbitals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='556000'>When we try to describe the bonding in this molecule,</span>
  <span m='561000'>we cannot have any bonds that involve 2pz and any of the three</span>
  <span m='566000'>hydrogen 1s orbitals because there is no net overlap between</span>
  <span m='572000'>them -- -- because those spherically</span> <span m='576000'>symmetric
  orbitals lie in the nodal plane of 2pz.</span> </p><p><span m='580000'>And that
  means, further, that we need to form</span> <span m='583000'>three in-plane bonds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='598000'>And that is the xy plane in plane bonds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='607000'>And these three bonds must be equivalent.</span> </p><p><span m='618000'>And
  what is interesting about the fact that they must be</span> <span m='622000'>equivalent
  is that what are the three orbitals that the boron</span> <span m='626000'>has that
  are in the x,y-plane, the three valence orbitals?</span> </p><p><span m='631000'>There
  is the 2s, the 2px, and the 2py.</span> </p><p><span m='634000'>Three orbitals that
  are not identical to one another,</span> <span m='638000'>yet we need to make three
  identical bonds because all the</span> <span m='643000'>studies that we do on the
  BH three molecule tells us</span> <span m='648000'>that each of these bonds are
  the same length, the molecule has</span> <span m='653000'>the perfect symmetry of
  a Mercedes Benz symbol,</span> <span m='657000'>it's trigonal planar. It has this
  three-fold</span> <span m='662000'>rotational symmetry to it. And so somehow,</span>
  <span m='666000'>using a 2s, a 2px, and a 2py, we need to make</span> <span m='670000'>three
  equivalent bonds. This is an energy level</span> <span m='675000'>diagram. And so,
  Pauling came up with</span> <span m='679000'>the idea of promotion. And promotion
  will correspond</span> <span m='684000'>to the following. I can draw 2px,</span>
  <span m='687000'>2py, 2pz, and 2s. And I can populate with</span> <span m='693000'>electrons.
  The boron atom has three.</span> </p><p><span m='696000'>Now I have put in three
  electrons into this energy level</span> <span m='701000'>diagram for the boron atom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='709000'>And now, this concept of promotion kicks in --</span> <span
  m='722000'>-- and reorganizes us electronically,</span> <span m='724000'>as follows.</span>
  </p><p><span m='736000'>According to our discussion, we need three equivalent</span>
  <span m='739000'>orbitals down here with the three electrons in to pair up</span>
  <span m='743000'>with the three electrons that come into the problem from the</span>
  <span m='747000'>three hydrogen atoms. At the end, we will show how</span> <span
  m='751000'>those electrons form the hydrogen atoms come in and pair</span> <span
  m='756000'>up with these three electrons on a promoted boron atom.</span> </p><p><span
  m='762000'>Up here, we have the boron 2pz orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='765000'>That
  stays by itself. And down here,</span> <span m='769000'>we are going to have a set
  of sp two hybrids.</span> </p><p><span m='780000'>The idea is now somehow we are
  going to get three orbitals down</span> <span m='786000'>here by mixing one part
  s and two parts p.</span> </p><p><span m='790000'>And, if we do this correctly mathematically,</span>
  <span m='795000'>these will have the right orientation in space to be</span> <span
  m='800000'>hybrids that have proper directionality for good overlap</span> <span
  m='805000'>with our hydrogen 1s oribtals. These are going to be three</span> <span
  m='812000'>equivalent hybrids.</span> </p><p><span m='820000'>How do we do that?
  Well, we are going to get our</span> <span m='823000'>equations for hybridization.</span>
  </p><p><span m='835000'>And we are going to develop these using some of the results</span>
  <span m='837000'>from quantum mechanics, which is what Pauling did.</span> </p><p><span
  m='850000'>And essentially, what we are going to do is seek</span> <span m='853000'>equations
  that have one part s and two parts p,</span> <span m='857000'>each of them, but
  which point in the correct</span> <span m='860000'>directions in space for making
  three separate two electron</span> <span m='865000'>bonds between the boron and
  the three hydrogens.</span> </p><p><span m='870000'>And so, I will just call them
  sp two of A,</span> <span m='875000'>because we are going to need one that points
  toward that A</span> <span m='881000'>hydrogen, which is along the positive x-axis,</span>
  <span m='886000'>we are going to need one that points toward the B hydrogen,</span>
  <span m='892000'>and we are going to need one that points toward the C</span> <span
  m='898000'>hydrogen. And the idea here is that we</span> <span m='902000'>are going
  to have some amount of the boron 2s,</span> <span m='907000'>px and py -- -- because
  pz is not</span> <span m='911000'>contributing to these three hybrids.</span> </p><p><span
  m='914000'>And each one of these is going to have some quantity of the</span> <span
  m='919000'>three orbitals that we have available.</span> </p><p><span m='922000'>And
  what you need to keep in mind here in setting up</span> <span m='926000'>equations
  like this is that px has a definite spatial</span> <span m='930000'>orientation
  with respect to the coordinate system that we have</span> <span m='935000'>chosen.
  And so does py.</span> </p><p><span m='938000'>And the way that we will make this
  come out using our blue</span> <span m='946000'>chalk is to note that we have a
  coefficient C1,</span> <span m='952000'>C2 and C3. Our job is going to be to find</span>
  <span m='957000'>the values of these coefficients,</span> <span m='961000'>C4, C5,
  C6, C7, C8, and C9.</span> </p><p><span m='966000'>We can use the rules of quantum
  mechanics, and I am going to</span> <span m='972000'>summarize a few of these rules
  for you before this lecture</span> <span m='977000'>ends, to find the values of
  these constants.</span> </p><p><span m='982000'>Let's go over here and begin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1010000'>Let's make note of the dictates of symmetry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1013000'>I will reference symmetry a couple of times today in class</span> <span
  m='1018000'>in working on this problem of finding those coefficients,</span> <span
  m='1023000'>one through nine. The neat thing is that the 2s</span> <span m='1027000'>orbital
  centered on that boron, which is going to be</span> <span m='1031000'>participating
  in these hybrids that are going to point toward</span> <span m='1036000'>hydrogens
  A, B, and C, that 2s orbital is</span> <span m='1039000'>spherically symmetric.
  Its wave function is the same</span> <span m='1043000'>as you go radially out from
  the boron center in any direction</span> <span m='1048000'>into space. What that
  symmetry</span> <span m='1051000'>consideration dictates is that there will be the
  same amount of</span> <span m='1058000'>boron 2s in the hybrids for A, as for B,
  as for C.</span> </p><p><span m='1063000'>And what that means is that C1 is equal
  to C4 is equal to C7.</span> </p><p><span m='1078000'>And we are going to need a
  value for this.</span> </p><p><span m='1081000'>And we can get a value for that
  by taking into consideration</span> <span m='1086000'>something called unit orbital
  contribution.</span> </p><p><span m='1099000'>What that says is that we have to
  use the boron's 2s orbital</span> <span m='1106000'>completely and identically once
  in that set of three equations.</span> </p><p><span m='1115000'>In other words,
  we are going to distribute it</span> <span m='1118000'>evenly among those three
  hybrids.</span> </p><p><span m='1120000'>And we have to distribute all of it evenly
  among those three</span> <span m='1124000'>hybrids. And here we are going to be</span>
  <span m='1127000'>interested in the square of the coefficients.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1130000'>And that is because when we talk about atomic orbitals,</span> <span
  m='1134000'>we know that the probability of finding an electron in that</span> <span
  m='1138000'>orbital is related to the square of the wave function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1144000'>And so, normally when we plot orbitals, like I just did with</span>
  <span m='1147000'>the pi bond of ethylene a few minutes ago, we are making an</span>
  <span m='1151000'>isosurface that corresponds to some percent probability of</span>
  <span m='1154000'>finding the electron at that point in space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1157000'>So, we are interested in probability distributions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1160000'>And these are related to the square of the wave function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1164000'>Here, for unit orbital, we are going to say that C1</span> <span m='1167000'>squared
  equals C4 squared. Sorry, plus C4 squared plus C7</span> <span m='1172000'>squared
  is equal to one. And,</span> <span m='1178000'>therefore, C1 is equal to C4 is equal
  to C7 is equal to one over</span> <span m='1184000'>root three.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1188000'>Now, we have found C1, C4, and C7.</span> </p><p><span m='1191000'>And,
  if we are going to complete sp two of A,</span> <span m='1196000'>get this first
  hybrid of the three, I am going to go across</span> <span m='1201000'>this way.
  I just went down one,</span> <span m='1205000'>four, and seven and pointed out that
  by the symmetry of the s</span> <span m='1209000'>orbital is due to the fact that
  the s orbital contributes once,</span> <span m='1213000'>unit orbital contribution,
  we could get C1,</span> <span m='1216000'>C4, and C7 equal to one over root three.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1219000'>Now I am interested in C2 and</span> <span m='1223000'>C3,
  so let's draw a little picture.</span> </p><p><span m='1235000'>This, remember,
  is our 1s orbital on HA.</span> </p><p><span m='1238000'>And what we are trying
  to do is to construct a hybrid focusing</span> <span m='1244000'>on that top equation
  that will be directed at HA.</span> </p><p><span m='1249000'>And we are keeping
  our axes the same as before,</span> <span m='1253000'>so that x points up and y
  goes to the left, as I am drawing it</span> <span m='1259000'>here. And z would
  be coming out at</span> <span m='1264000'>us. What I am going to draw now is</span>
  <span m='1268000'>a picture of the boron's 2py orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1273000'>And,
  as I usually do, I am taking the convention that</span> <span m='1280000'>the negative
  phase lobe of the boron's 2py orbital--</span> <span m='1288000'>Negative is shaded.
  That is my convention.</span> </p><p><span m='1292000'>That 2py orbital lies in
  the xy plane and points along y.</span> </p><p><span m='1298000'>Its positive lobe,
  in fact, points along positive</span> <span m='1303000'>y. Its negative lobe points
  along</span> <span m='1306000'>negative y. And what can we say about the</span>
  <span m='1310000'>relationship of the HA 1s orbital to the 2py orbital of</span>
  <span m='1316000'>that central boron atom?</span> </p><p><span m='1325000'>Let me
  phrase it this way. The 2py orbital of our central</span> <span m='1331000'>boron
  atom has a nodal plane. What is that nodal plane?</span> </p><p><span m='1336000'>xz
  is a nodal plane of the 2py orbital, right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1342000'>Just
  like this. And so, what you see is that</span> <span m='1347000'>this HA is not
  only in the nodal plane of 2pz,</span> <span m='1351000'>it is also in the nodal
  plane of 2py.</span> </p><p><span m='1357000'>And that means any positive interference
  by bonding between</span> <span m='1362000'>HA's 1s and the positive lobe of 2py
  would be exactly canceled by</span> <span m='1367000'>the equal and opposite negative
  interference between a</span> <span m='1372000'>hydrogen's 1s orbital and the negative
  phase lobe on 2py.</span> </p><p><span m='1377000'>And that means that we know the
  value of C3.</span> </p><p><span m='1382000'>We can say, therefore, that C3 is equal
  to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1388000'>That is really cool because now we are
  going to be able to bring</span> <span m='1397000'>in one more consideration and
  complete the formula for sp two</span> <span m='1406000'>of A.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1421000'>We are going to be able to use the normalization condition,</span> <span
  m='1423000'>--</span> <span m='1434000'>-- which tells us that C1 squared plus C2
  squared plus C3</span> <span m='1441000'>squared is equal to one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1448000'>Once we formed this new hybrid by mixing together s and p wave</span>
  <span m='1451000'>functions, we are going to find that this normalization</span>
  <span m='1455000'>condition must be satisfied for the hybrid orbital just as it
  is</span> <span m='1459000'>satisfied for these atomic orbitals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1461000'>That is so that the probability of finding an electron somewhere</span>
  <span m='1465000'>is space associated with this hybrid wave function is one,</span>
  <span m='1469000'>if there is an electron in this orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1473000'>That
  is where this comes from. And we know that C3 squared is</span> <span m='1479000'>zero.
  C1 squared is one</span> <span m='1482000'>over root three. So,</span> <span m='1486000'>we
  know that sp squared of A is equal to one over root three.</span> </p><p><span m='1492000'>And
  then we can say that,</span> <span m='1497000'>by virtue of this and the fact that
  C3 is zero,</span> <span m='1502000'>C2 could be equal to either plus or minus the
  square root of</span> <span m='1508000'>two over three.</span> </p><p><span m='1514000'>And
  we have to figure out which one of these to use.</span> </p><p><span m='1518000'>Remember
  that C2 is the coefficient on px.</span> </p><p><span m='1522000'>Let's reference
  our diagram on our coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='1526000'>We have our
  x-axis and our y-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>And we are looking for the
  sign of the coefficient on the boron</span> <span m='1537000'>2px orbital. That
  is our C2 coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='1542000'>And I am shading negative
  here. And, in order to overlap</span> <span m='1549000'>constructively and form
  a bond to the 1s orbital of HA,</span> <span m='1556000'>we want positive as our
  coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='1562000'>Because that is going to make the same
  phase lobes interact in</span> <span m='1568000'>a sigma fashion. We know that sp
  squared of A is</span> <span m='1573000'>equal to one over root three times the
  boron's 2s orbital</span> <span m='1579000'>plus the square root of two over three
  2px orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1591000'>And now that we have the coefficients
  on that hybrid</span> <span m='1596000'>orbital, we can draw a picture of what that
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='1601000'>That is equal to taking the boron 1s orbital
  here and adding</span> <span m='1608000'>to it the 2px orbital that looks like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1613000'>This is the conceptual breakthrough that Pauling made.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1620000'>You could mix atomic orbital wave functions located on
  a</span> <span m='1623000'>central atom in order to generate these hybrids that
  have</span> <span m='1627000'>the proper directionality for good overlap with the
  peripheral</span> <span m='1632000'>atoms that bond to the central atom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1634000'>And when I do this, what you can see is that we are</span>
  <span m='1638000'>going to get constructive interference with the positive</span>
  <span m='1641000'>lobe and destructive interference with the negative</span> <span
  m='1645000'>lobe when we add this boron 2s orbital to the boron 2px</span> <span
  m='1649000'>orbital. And that should give us</span> <span m='1653000'>something
  that looks like this, with an enlarged lobe pointing</span> <span m='1658000'>along
  positive x and a diminished negative node</span> <span m='1662000'>pointing along
  negative x. That is our hybrid.</span> </p><p><span m='1666000'>We have developed
  some coefficients here.</span> </p><p><span m='1669000'>We just got it pictorially,
  and here we show you the</span> <span m='1674000'>picture of the hybrid. And then,
  we need to continue.</span> </p><p><span m='1689000'>We need to use the remainder
  of our 2px orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1694000'>The one thing we cannot do in
  constructing a set of hybrid</span> <span m='1700000'>orbitals from a set of atomic
  orbitals is forgetting to use</span> <span m='1706000'>part of our orbital. We need
  to use all of the</span> <span m='1711000'>orbital that we are given to construct
  these hybrids with.</span> </p><p><span m='1718000'>And what that means is we have
  now a relationship between C5</span> <span m='1724000'>and C8, because we now know
  C2 is plus root two over three.</span> </p><p><span m='1731000'>Let's use this unit
  orbital idea and</span> <span m='1737000'>reference 2px -- -- and say that C2 squared
  plus</span> <span m='1743000'>C5 squared plus C8 squared, these are all the coefficients</span>
  <span m='1750000'>that deal with the px contributions to these three</span> <span
  m='1756000'>hybrids, is equal to one. And</span> <span m='1762000'>we know C2 squared
  is equal to two-thirds.</span> </p><p><span m='1767000'>And now let's draw a picture
  to</span> <span m='1773000'>help us figure out something else about C5 and C8.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1779000'>Here I am simply representing, with the same coordinate
  system</span> <span m='1786000'>that I am using throughout, the boron atomic orbital
  that</span> <span m='1792000'>is the 2px orbital. And, if I consider,</span> <span
  m='1798000'>down here, the s orbitals on HA and HB, I can say something</span> <span
  m='1804000'>about the way in which 2px interacts with HA as compared</span> <span
  m='1810000'>with the way in which it interacts with HB.</span> </p><p><span m='1815000'>Notice
  that these HA and HB atomic positions are mirror</span> <span m='1821000'>images
  of each other with respect to this 2px orbital in</span> <span m='1827000'>the middle.
  That tells us that C5 must be</span> <span m='1833000'>equal to C8. We are using</span>
  <span m='1837000'>symmetry as a mathematical argument here to say that C5 is</span>
  <span m='1843000'>equal to C8. Therefore, we can figure out</span> <span m='1848000'>exactly
  what C5 and C8 are because we already know that C2</span> <span m='1854000'>squared
  is two-thirds.</span> </p><p><span m='1860000'>We know that C5 squared plus C8 squared
  has got to be equal to</span> <span m='1868000'>one-third. And that</span> <span
  m='1873000'>means that C5 is equal to C6, sorry, C8, which is equal to</span> <span
  m='1881000'>one over the square root of six.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>Because
  we put this in here, we will get a sixth plus a</span> <span m='1894000'>sixth,
  two-sixths, which is one-third,</span> <span m='1897000'>plus the two-thirds, which
  will be one.</span> </p><p><span m='1899000'>And so, we know it is one over root
  six.</span> </p><p><span m='1902000'>However, it could be a positive or a negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1906000'>And we need to figure out just which it is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1909000'>Is it positive or is it negative here?</span> </p><p><span m='1912000'>And
  I will come back to that issue just in a moment,</span> <span m='1916000'>when we
  draw these functions. But notice that these are the</span> <span m='1922000'>coefficients
  on 2px and the positive lobe points up toward</span> <span m='1926000'>HA. We are
  going to need it to be</span> <span m='1928000'>flipped around and be pointing down
  if we are going to form</span> <span m='1933000'>bonds to HA and HB. So, that will
  dictate the sign</span> <span m='1936000'>here as negative one over root six.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1939000'>We do not have, yet, the complete equations for</span>
  <span m='1942000'>sp two of B and sp two of C because we</span> <span m='1947000'>need
  C6 and C9. Let's see how we can get those.</span> </p><p><span m='1981000'>C6 and
  C9 relate to the py orbital that is oriented like</span> <span m='1988000'>this
  with reference to our coordinate system,</span> <span m='1994000'>with the negative
  phase shaded as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='1999000'>And specifically, C6 relates
  to the interaction</span> <span m='2005000'>with this HB down here. And C9 relates
  to the</span> <span m='2011000'>interaction with the 1s orbital on HC down here,</span>
  <span m='2015000'>on the lower right. And because this py orbital</span> <span m='2019000'>charges
  phase as we pass through the origin, and we want the</span> <span m='2024000'>positive
  phase to match up both with HB and with HC in the</span> <span m='2028000'>contributions
  to the hybrid wave functions, we are going to know,</span> <span m='2033000'>and
  by the symmetry of this problem, that these are negative</span> <span m='2038000'>mirror
  images of each other. So, we know that C6 is equal to</span> <span m='2046000'>negative
  C9. And if we put that</span> <span m='2052000'>together with unit orbital contribution,</span>
  <span m='2058000'>we can see, because we know that we have our sp two of B</span>
  <span m='2066000'>and sp two of C,</span> <span m='2071000'>both of them have one
  over root three of the 2s contributing.</span> </p><p><span m='2082000'>And then
  we are looking for six and nine.</span> </p><p><span m='2086000'>We found out over
  there that both of them have negative one</span> <span m='2093000'>over root six
  as the coefficient on px.</span> </p><p><span m='2099000'>And then, we know that
  since this is the one that points to</span> <span m='2103000'>B, we do not need
  to flip the phase on py to get a bond</span> <span m='2106000'>forming between py
  and HB. This is going to be a positive,</span> <span m='2110000'>and then this one
  is going to be a negative,</span> <span m='2113000'>for the reasons I just mentioned,
  that we are going to</span> <span m='2117000'>need to flip that py contribution
  to sp squared of C,</span> <span m='2121000'>as compared to sp squared of B,</span>
  <span m='2124000'>in order to get this positive</span> <span m='2127000'>lobe over
  here interacting with HC in that function.</span> </p><p><span m='2132000'>I am
  going to draw these functions in just a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='2136000'>But
  now, when we note that normalization requires that the</span> <span m='2141000'>sum
  of the squares of the coefficients be equal to one,</span> <span m='2145000'>and
  we know that C3 was zero, so that there is no</span> <span m='2150000'>contribution
  at all of py to sp squared of A,</span> <span m='2155000'>and all of it must be
  here and here, that means that our</span> <span m='2159000'>coefficient is one over
  root two of py.</span> </p><p><span m='2166000'>Using these restrictions from quantum
  mechanics,</span> <span m='2170000'>we actually have coefficients on the spx and
  py orbitals that</span> <span m='2175000'>show how they go together. And the way
  in which these add</span> <span m='2180000'>up is similar to what we have seen over
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2184000'>It is a little more complicated because both
  px and py</span> <span m='2189000'>contribute. Let me show you what they look</span>
  <span m='2194000'>like. This mathematical manipulation</span> <span m='2197000'>of
  these functions produces linear combinations that all</span> <span m='2203000'>three
  look the same as the symmetry of this problem would</span> <span m='2209000'>dictate.
  It is a three-fold symmetry</span> <span m='2213000'>type of problem. And this is
  our sp two</span> <span m='2218000'>orbital pointing toward B with this mathematical
  form.</span> </p><p><span m='2225000'>We have to flip around px so that the positive
  lobe of px</span> <span m='2229000'>contributes down here. We do not have to flip
  py.</span> </p><p><span m='2233000'>And we have differing amounts of px and py in
  this hybrid wave</span> <span m='2238000'>function. But the math of the atomic</span>
  <span m='2241000'>orbitals guarantees that this form would be physically</span>
  <span m='2245000'>indistinguishable from this one over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2250000'>They would look exactly identical if I plotted a</span> <span m='2254000'>probability
  density isosurface. These two-dimensional pictures</span> <span m='2259000'>that
  we draw on the board are like slices through</span> <span m='2263000'>three-dimensional
  probability density isosurfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>That is what these
  representations are.</span> </p><p><span m='2270000'>And then, we note that the
  py orbital is flipped around when</span> <span m='2275000'>we form sp squared of
  C.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>And that leads to this appearance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2290000'>I would like to show you what one of these might look like if</span>
  <span m='2295000'>you calculated it from the math that we have developed,</span>
  <span m='2301000'>here.</span> </p><p><span m='2330000'>I have actually got more
  work to do here in the next five</span> <span m='2334000'>minutes, so let's keep
  our concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='2337000'>Look at this orbital. This thing
  is a beautiful</span> <span m='2341000'>hybrid orbital. And I have calculated this
  with</span> <span m='2344000'>reference to a particular arbitrary molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2346000'>This was calculated with reference to the water molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2350000'>The positions of the nuclei in the water molecular are</span>
  <span m='2353000'>indicated by these arbitrarily sized spheres.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2356000'>That is a typical ball and stick representation of a</span> <span m='2359000'>molecule
  in 3D. You can see that the oxygen of</span> <span m='2361000'>the water molecule
  is colored red, in there.</span> </p><p><span m='2364000'>That is arbitrary. And
  then we have the hydrogens</span> <span m='2367000'>in white. And then I have a
  big positive</span> <span m='2370000'>lobe in blue here and then a smaller yellow
  lobe that is our</span> <span m='2374000'>negative lobe on this orbital, here, which
  is an added mixture</span> <span m='2378000'>of an s orbital with a p orbital.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2380000'>I am not telling you the actual coefficients that went
  into this</span> <span m='2384000'>particular hybrid, but you can see how if I were</span>
  <span m='2387000'>to take a two-dimensional slice along the long axis of this</span>
  <span m='2391000'>hybrid orbital, it might look something like</span> <span m='2394000'>what
  we have drawn over there. Namely, with one nice large</span> <span m='2399000'>directed
  lobe, that can have good overlap with</span> <span m='2403000'>a hydrogen 1s orbital
  in order to give rise to a good two</span> <span m='2408000'>electron bond between
  hydrogen and boron.</span> </p><p><span m='2412000'>And let me illustrate how that
  impacts on how we draw our</span> <span m='2417000'>energy-level diagram for the
  BH three molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2422000'>What we have now is a situation
  in which, as you go up in</span> <span m='2427000'>energy, you find three orbitals
  that are all at the same energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2435000'>These lines indicate
  places where we can put electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2440000'>And, in fact,
  they look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2452000'>They represent positive interference
  up along x.</span> </p><p><span m='2460000'>Positive interference between a sp two
  hybrid that</span> <span m='2464000'>points down at atom B, right here, overlapping
  nicely</span> <span m='2468000'>with the hydrogen 1s wave function that is sitting
  out</span> <span m='2472000'>there, surrounding that nucleus. And then over here
  is our</span> <span m='2477000'>hybrid orbital sp squared of C that points down</span>
  <span m='2481000'>here and interacts with the hydrogen 1s orbital on atom C.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2487000'>And so, the idea is now this system, BH three,</span> <span
  m='2491000'>has a total of six valance electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2494000'>Valance
  shell electron pair repulsion theory could be used</span> <span m='2499000'>by you
  to predict the geometry that we started with for this</span> <span m='2504000'>problem.
  But now, we can populate these</span> <span m='2508000'>bonding orbitals with electron
  pairs, as shown here.</span> </p><p><span m='2512000'>And then, this problem has
  one more aspect to it,</span> <span m='2516000'>namely that up here somewhere higher
  in energy there is a 2pz</span> <span m='2522000'>orbital on the boron that is empty.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2525000'>And this empty orbital --</span> <span m='2537000'>-- is
  our feature that gives this molecule Lewis acid</span> <span m='2541000'>character.
  We know that this is an</span> <span m='2544000'>electron deficient system. It does
  not satisfy the octet</span> <span m='2549000'>rule. And, specifically,</span> <span
  m='2551000'>where it is missing electrons are in that boron 2pz orbital.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2555000'>That allows you to predict something about the</span> <span
  m='2558000'>stereochemistry of reactions, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='2560000'>It
  says that if some nucleophile or Lewis base,</span> <span m='2563000'>a source of
  a pair of electrons is going to come in and approach</span> <span m='2568000'>that
  planar BH three molecule, it will do so either</span> <span m='2571000'>along positive
  z or along negative z because that is where</span> <span m='2575000'>the big lobes
  are of that empty pz orbital point.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>And, this valance
  bond theory --</span> <span m='2591000'>-- satisfies this problem, that Pauling
  noticed,</span> <span m='2595000'>of how do we make three identical bonds in a plane
  that</span> <span m='2600000'>contains three dissimilar atomic orbital wave functions,</span>
  <span m='2605000'>an s orbital px and a py? Well, he found that</span> <span m='2609000'>mathematically
  you can mix them together in ways that gives you</span> <span m='2613000'>three
  identical hybrids that have the needed directionality</span> <span m='2617000'>for
  the forming of these three two electron bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='2621000'>There
  is an alternative solution to this problem,</span> <span m='2624000'>and we will
  call that molecular orbital theory.</span> </p><p><span m='2628000'>Don't forget
  about Robert S. Mulliken, MIT undergraduate</span> <span m='2632000'>thesis 1917.
  And MO theory is a different</span> <span m='2634000'>perspective on electronic
  structure theory for molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2640000'>And we will launch
  into that on Wednesday.</span> </p>
