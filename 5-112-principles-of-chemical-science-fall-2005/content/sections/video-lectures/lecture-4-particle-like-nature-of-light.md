  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Where were we, last time?</span>
  </p><p><span m='17000'>Last time, we said we were setting aside the problem of the</span>
  <span m='22000'>structure of the atom. We were setting it aside</span> <span m='26000'>because
  we were stuck, and what we had to do was to</span> <span m='30000'>look at another
  area of discussion.</span> </p><p><span m='34000'>And that is this wave-particle
  duality of light and matter,</span> <span m='38000'>because it is that discussion
  that is going to give us the</span> <span m='43000'>clues about how to proceed.
  We are putting aside the</span> <span m='48000'>discussion of the structure of the
  atom all the way until next</span> <span m='53000'>Wednesday, because next Monday,
  I was reminded,</span> <span m='57000'>is a student holiday. [APPLAUSE]</span> <span
  m='70000'>And so we started. We talked about the wave-like</span> <span m='74000'>properties
  of light. We said that the property of</span> <span m='79000'>superposition, the
  fact that you can put waves</span> <span m='83000'>at the same point in space and
  their amplitudes add.</span> </p><p><span m='89000'>Since waves have both positive
  and negative amplitude,</span> <span m='93000'>that means that you have constructive
  and destructive</span> <span m='97000'>interference. And it is those interference</span>
  <span m='100000'>phenomena, then, that are evidence for wave-like</span> <span m='103000'>property.
  And we did the two-slit</span> <span m='106000'>experiment to try to give you an
  example of interference</span> <span m='110000'>phenomena. We were trying to understand</span>
  <span m='113000'>those interference phenomena, and did so in terms of this</span>
  <span m='117000'>diagram here. The interference phenomena that</span> <span m='122000'>we
  saw was an array, actually a row of bright spots,</span> <span m='127000'>dark spots,
  bright spots, dark spots.</span> </p><p><span m='130000'>And we drew these semicircles
  here around each one of the</span> <span m='135000'>slits. They represent a little
  bit of</span> <span m='138000'>the wave that emanated through those slits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142000'>Because those slits are small, then, those waves emanated</span>
  <span m='147000'>equally in all directions. That is why these semicircles</span>
  <span m='153000'>represent the wave maxima. And what we discovered is that</span>
  <span m='157000'>if we looked along this line here, this line which led to</span>
  <span m='162000'>this bright spot, that all of the waves along</span> <span m='165000'>this
  line were constructively interfering.</span> </p><p><span m='168000'>That is, we
  had the maximum of the two waves at the same point</span> <span m='173000'>in space,
  or the minimum of the two waves at the same point in</span> <span m='178000'>space.
  And we noticed that everywhere</span> <span m='182000'>along this line, where we
  had that constructive</span> <span m='185000'>interference, the difference in the
  distance</span> <span m='188000'>of the waves traveled was one lambda.</span> </p><p><span
  m='190000'>We noticed, here, that everywhere along this line</span> <span m='193000'>that
  led to a very bright spot, we had constructive</span> <span m='197000'>interference.
  And the difference in distance</span> <span m='200000'>traveled by those two waves
  was two lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='203000'>And, likewise, up here, along this
  line,</span> <span m='205000'>the difference in the distance traveled was zero lambda.</span>
  </p><p><span m='211000'>And from just that, in a sense, qualitative</span> <span
  m='214000'>observation, we drew a conclusion.</span> </p><p><span m='217000'>And
  that conclusion was in order to get maximum</span> <span m='221000'>constructive
  interference, a condition that had obtain,</span> <span m='226000'>is that the difference
  in the distance traveled by the two</span> <span m='230000'>waves has to be an integral
  multiple of the wavelength.</span> </p><p><span m='235000'>N could be 0, 1, 2, 3,
  etc.</span> </p><p><span m='239000'>And so, the very bright spot here that always
  bisects the two</span> <span m='243000'>slits, since N is 0, we call that the zero-order</span>
  <span m='246000'>interference feature, or the zero-order fraction</span> <span m='250000'>feature.
  The bright spot that is either</span> <span m='253000'>to the left or to the right
  or up or down of that center bright</span> <span m='257000'>spot is the first-order
  diffraction feature or the</span> <span m='261000'>first-order interference feature.</span>
  </p><p><span m='263000'>And then the second bright spot up or down from the center
  is a</span> <span m='268000'>second-order diffraction feature.</span> </p><p><span
  m='272000'>And so on and so on. And in recitation section,</span> <span m='275000'>what
  you also should have done, is you should have reasoned</span> <span m='280000'>through
  what the condition was for destructive interference.</span> </p><p><span m='285000'>That
  is in between these bright spots, you have dark spots as a</span> <span m='290000'>result
  of destructive interference.</span> </p><p><span m='293000'>And that results because,
  say, right here you get a dark</span> <span m='298000'>spot -- Right here at that
  point you</span> <span m='302000'>would see the maximum of one wave at the same
  point in space</span> <span m='307000'>as the minimum of the other, and so they
  exactly cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='312000'>And so by just analyzing what waves
  were destructively</span> <span m='317000'>interfering, you should have come up
  with a general</span> <span m='321000'>expression for destructive interference,</span>
  <span m='324000'>of N plus one-half, that quanity,</span> <span m='327000'>times
  lambda. That is your general condition</span> <span m='332000'>for destructive interference,
  the difference in the distance</span> <span m='337000'>traveled by the two waves.
  This kind of diagram here we</span> <span m='341000'>are also going to see on Friday,
  because this interference</span> <span m='345000'>phenomenon is the property associated
  with waves.</span> </p><p><span m='349000'>And what we are going to do is see this
  diagram again when we</span> <span m='354000'>scatter electrons for particles. We
  are going to see that</span> <span m='360000'>particles, also, will destructively
  and</span> <span m='364000'>constructively interfere. They also have wave-like</span>
  <span m='369000'>properties. That is what we will do on</span> <span m='373000'>Friday.
  We have established,</span> <span m='375000'>now, the wave-like properties of radiation,</span>
  <span m='380000'>so I would like to move on and talk about the evidence for the</span>
  <span m='386000'>particle-like nature of radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='396000'>The
  evidence for the particle-like nature of</span> <span m='401000'>radiation comes
  from an effect called the photoelectric effect.</span> </p><p><span m='408000'>Shortly
  after Thompson discovered the electron,</span> <span m='413000'>scientists were
  noticing that if you took a metal and shined</span> <span m='420000'>radiation on
  that metal, that indeed electrons were</span> <span m='426000'>emitted. Electrons
  came off.</span> </p><p><span m='430000'>These were called photoelectrons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='434000'>However, the radiation that you shined on the metal had
  to have</span> <span m='440000'>a frequency nu that was greater than or equal to
  some threshold</span> <span m='446000'>frequency, nu nought. That is, if you took
  radiation</span> <span m='452000'>of some frequency here, nu, that was less than
  this</span> <span m='458000'>threshold frequency, well, you did not get any</span>
  <span m='463000'>electrons off. Well, another way to kind of</span> <span m='468000'>understand
  that data or that effect is to just plot the</span> <span m='474000'>number of the
  electrons that come off as a function of the</span> <span m='481000'>frequency of
  the radiation. And so at low frequency,</span> <span m='488000'>there are no electrons,
  but all of a sudden you get to</span> <span m='492000'>nu nought, and then electrons
  start coming off.</span> </p><p><span m='496000'>And no matter how high you increase
  the frequency here,</span> <span m='501000'>the number of electrons that come off
  remains the same,</span> <span m='505000'>remains constant. And it turned out that
  for the</span> <span m='510000'>metals that were looked at, at that time,</span>
  <span m='514000'>the threshold frequency, here, was in the UV range of</span> <span
  m='518000'>the electromagnetic spectrum. Well, in addition to just</span> <span
  m='523000'>measuring the number of electrons and generally</span> <span m='527000'>observing
  this effect, scientists did not understand</span> <span m='532000'>what was going
  on. So they just started measuring</span> <span m='536000'>everything they could
  think about measuring.</span> </p><p><span m='542000'>And one quantity that they
  measured was the kinetic energy</span> <span m='546000'>of these electrons that
  were being emitted.</span> </p><p><span m='550000'>And so you take kinetic energy
  here, KE, as a function of the</span> <span m='555000'>frequency. They found that
  at low</span> <span m='558000'>frequency, again, there is no kinetic energy,</span>
  <span m='562000'>because there are no electrons. And then at some frequency,</span>
  <span m='567000'>all of a sudden electrons started coming off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='572000'>And the kinetic energy of those electrons seemed to increase</span> <span
  m='578000'>with the frequency once past that threshold frequency,</span> <span m='583000'>nu
  nought. Well, this was really another</span> <span m='587000'>one of these conundrums,
  here, at that time,</span> <span m='591000'>because classical physics, classical
  electromagnetism,</span> <span m='597000'>classical physics had no way of explaining
  these data.</span> </p><p><span m='604000'>And, in fact, what classical physics</span>
  <span m='606000'>predicted is that the kinetic energy of these electrons,</span>
  <span m='610000'>that that kinetic energy should have nothing to do with the</span>
  <span m='614000'>frequency of the light. That is, the kinetic energy was</span>
  <span m='618000'>constant. As you increased the frequency</span> <span m='621000'>of
  the light, classical physics would tell</span> <span m='624000'>you that the kinetic
  energy should not be affected by the</span> <span m='628000'>frequency of the light.
  There was nothing in the</span> <span m='633000'>classical way of thinking, classical
  electromagnetism that</span> <span m='638000'>connected the frequency of the light
  to the kind of energy,</span> <span m='643000'>to the kinetic energy. There was
  no way for blue light</span> <span m='648000'>to make the electrons have a larger
  kinetic energy,</span> <span m='652000'>and for blue light to have an effect on
  the kinetic energy,</span> <span m='657000'>and red light to not have an effect
  on the kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='664000'>In addition, what classical
  physics</span> <span m='667000'>predicted is that the kinetic energy of the electrons
  should</span> <span m='673000'>be dependent on the intensity of the light.</span>
  </p><p><span m='677000'>That is, the more and more intense the radiation on the</span>
  <span m='682000'>metal, the more and more kinetic energy those electrons should</span>
  <span m='688000'>have. Because, after all,</span> <span m='691000'>if you increase
  the intensity of the light going into the</span> <span m='696000'>metal, you are
  putting more and more energy into it.</span> </p><p><span m='701000'>That should
  be reflected in just how energetic those</span> <span m='705000'>electrons were
  picked out. The more energy in,</span> <span m='709000'>the electrons ought to come
  out with larger and larger kinetic</span> <span m='714000'>energy. Of course, the
  observation was</span> <span m='718000'>that the kinetic energy of the electrons
  had nothing to do with</span> <span m='723000'>the intensity of light. The kinetic
  energy of the</span> <span m='729000'>electrons did not increase as you made the
  light brighter and</span> <span m='734000'>brighter. As you put more and more energy</span>
  <span m='738000'>in, the kinetic energy remained the same.</span> </p><p><span m='741000'>It
  didn't have an effect. This was a real conundrum here.</span> </p><p><span m='746000'>The
  known classical physics was making predictions really just</span> <span m='751000'>contrary
  to what was being observed.</span> </p><p><span m='756000'>These data, here, of
  the kinetic energy versus</span> <span m='761000'>the frequency, were around for
  a few years</span> <span m='765000'>before Einstein took a look at them in 1905,</span>
  <span m='770000'>a hundred years ago. And he looked at these data for</span> <span
  m='776000'>many different metals. Here is some data for metal A,</span> <span m='783000'>for
  example, and here is some data for metal</span> <span m='787000'>B. And, in both
  cases,</span> <span m='789000'>it certainly looked like the kinetic energy was linearly</span>
  <span m='795000'>dependent on the frequency of the radiation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='799000'>But what was different for the two different metals was the</span> <span
  m='805000'>threshold frequency here, nu nought.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>What
  Einstein did was, he went and fitted a straight</span> <span m='816000'>line to
  these data, y equals mx plus b.</span> </p><p><span m='823000'>And when he did that,</span>
  <span m='826000'>and he went to calculate the slope here, m,</span> <span m='831000'>of
  these lines, he thought "very interesting."</span> <span m='839000'>Because the
  slope of those lines was 6.626x10^-34 joule</span> <span m='845000'>seconds. The
  slope of those lines was</span> <span m='849000'>something called Planck's constant,
  h.</span> </p><p><span m='854000'>You say so what? Well, the reason he was so</span>
  <span m='859000'>interested in this is because just a few years earlier,</span>
  <span m='865000'>there was a scientist by the name of Max Planck who was</span>
  <span m='871000'>interested in understanding what was called the black-body</span>
  <span m='878000'>radiation data. What is a black-body?</span> </p><p><span m='884000'>Well,
  let's just, for simplicity purposes,</span> <span m='887000'>think of the black-body
  as the burner on an electric stove.</span> </p><p><span m='893000'>What you know
  is that if you turn up the voltage on that</span> <span m='898000'>burner, the burner
  gets hot. It increased in temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='904000'>And you increase
  the temperature, and sooner or</span> <span m='907000'>later, that burner is glowing
  bright red.</span> </p><p><span m='910000'>And you increase the temperature some
  more,</span> <span m='913000'>and the burner is glowing a brighter red.</span> </p><p><span
  m='916000'>And you increase it some more, and it is glowing orange.</span> </p><p><span
  m='919000'>And you increase it some more, which you shouldn't do,</span> <span m='923000'>and
  it's glowing yellow. And then if you could increase</span> <span m='927000'>it some
  more, it's glowing white.</span> </p><p><span m='931000'>What is happening, as you
  increase the</span> <span m='934000'>temperature, is that the radiation from that
  black-body,</span> <span m='939000'>this is the black-body radiation, is increasing
  in</span> <span m='944000'>intensity. But, more importantly,</span> <span m='947000'>the
  frequency is getting larger and larger.</span> </p><p><span m='951000'>Dark red,
  bright red, orange, yellow,</span> <span m='954000'>white, those are all frequencies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='957000'>The frequency is shifting to higher and higher values.</span>
  </p><p><span m='964000'>And what was actually done at that time is that the intensity</span>
  <span m='970000'>of that black-body radiation, oh, and this material is not in</span>
  <span m='976000'>your notes, because you are not responsible for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='981000'>I am just trying to make this surprise that Einstein noticed</span> <span
  m='987000'>about the slope. I am just trying to put it in</span> <span m='992000'>some
  context, why he was so surprised and</span> <span m='995000'>amazed at it. This
  black-body intensity here,</span> <span m='999000'>people had dispersed that radiation
  and looked at the</span> <span m='1003000'>frequencies that were coming off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1006000'>This is intensity versus frequency.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1009000'>Here is a general shape of that intensity versus frequency.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1014000'>That was observed for some temperature T one.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>That
  was a low temperature. And then, when the temperature</span> <span m='1025000'>was
  increased and the intensity versus frequency was observed,</span> <span m='1030000'>well,
  the frequencies generally got higher.</span> </p><p><span m='1034000'>This is higher
  temperature. Intensity goes up.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>And you increase
  the temperature some more,</span> <span m='1042000'>and you get even higher frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1045000'>T three is the highest temperature.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1050000'>And that is what the data were. What Planck was trying to do</span>
  <span m='1056000'>was to understand the origin of that black-body radiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1063000'>What he said was that in these black-bodies,</span> <span
  m='1068000'>in these materials, what there must be are</span> <span m='1072000'>oscillators
  that are giving off this radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='1079000'>But he had another
  little kick to these oscillators.</span> </p><p><span m='1084000'>These oscillators
  were giving off radiation or energy in</span> <span m='1090000'>chunks, in quanta,
  in particles.</span> </p><p><span m='1093000'>And using that idea, plus some statistical</span>
  <span m='1098000'>mechanics, he was able to calculate the shapes of these</span>
  <span m='1103000'>curves. That is, he indeed got,</span> <span m='1106000'>for the
  lowest temperature here, a curve that looked like</span> <span m='1112000'>this.
  And for T two,</span> <span m='1116000'>he got a curve that looked like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1119000'>And for T three, he got a curve that looked like</span>
  <span m='1124000'>this. He got the shape right,</span> <span m='1127000'>but he
  wanted to get the intensity right,</span> <span m='1130000'>too. What he realized
  he had to do</span> <span m='1133000'>was he essentially needed to have a scaling
  factor,</span> <span m='1137000'>actually, in front of his frequencies of his oscillators.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1144000'>He wanted a constant. And so he said,</span> <span m='1147000'>what
  constant do I have to have in order to make all of these</span> <span m='1153000'>data
  fit the observation? That constant is Planck's</span> <span m='1158000'>constant,
  his own 6.626x10^-34 joule seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='1162000'>There it is.
  That is Planck's constant.</span> </p><p><span m='1166000'>That is it. There is
  nothing deeper here.</span> </p><p><span m='1171000'>It is a natural constant. It
  comes from our observations</span> <span m='1176000'>of the world, of nature.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1179000'>That is it. It is a fitting constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1182000'>And so that is why Einstein was so amazed, here,</span> <span m='1187000'>when
  he realized this number is the same as what comes out of</span> <span m='1194000'>here.
  There must be something very</span> <span m='1197000'>fundamental about this h,
  this Planck's constant.</span> </p><p><span m='1204000'>That is the story. Isn't
  that amazing?</span> </p><p><span m='1209000'>What Einstein then proceeded to do,
  of course,</span> <span m='1216000'>is to write down the equation of the straight
  line that he</span> <span m='1224000'>just put through these data. And so that equation
  is the</span> <span m='1233000'>kinetic energy equal to nu, which is our x,</span>
  <span m='1238000'>h, which is the slope. And then what he found was that</span>
  <span m='1244000'>the intercept here, of course, is minus h times nu</span> <span
  m='1250000'>nought. This is plus minus h times nu</span> <span m='1256000'>nought.
  And that is the equation of a</span> <span m='1262000'>straight line. Of course,
  he realized,</span> <span m='1265000'>if this is energy on this side, boy, there
  better be energy on</span> <span m='1271000'>this side. And so this h times nu</span>
  <span m='1274000'>better be an energy. And since this nu was the</span> <span m='1278000'>frequency
  of the incident radiation, therefore,</span> <span m='1282000'>h times nu better
  be the energy of the incident radiation,</span> <span m='1287000'>E sub i. That
  is where this expression,</span> <span m='1292000'>energy equals h times nu comes
  from.</span> </p><p><span m='1296000'>Nothing more. That is where it comes from,</span>
  <span m='1300000'>the photoelectric effect. This was the first time that</span>
  <span m='1305000'>there was any relationship between the frequency of the</span>
  <span m='1310000'>radiation and the energy of the radiation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1313000'>In classical electromagnetism, there is no relationship</span> <span
  m='1318000'>between the frequency and the energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1323000'>This
  was the first time in which that relationship was</span> <span m='1328000'>observed.
  And what this is saying is the</span> <span m='1332000'>following. This is saying
  that you can</span> <span m='1336000'>have any frequency of radiation you want,
  but the corresponding</span> <span m='1343000'>energy comes in these chunks of h
  times nu.</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>h is a quantization constant. Radiation,
  nu,</span> <span m='1355000'>is continuous, but the energy that corresponds</span>
  <span m='1361000'>to any given frequency of radiation is h times nu.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1368000'>This E equals h times nu, here, is thought of as a</span> <span m='1376000'>quantum
  of energy. A particle of energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1382000'>A chunk of energy.
  Later on, it became the photon,</span> <span m='1388000'>the energy of a photon.
  If this h times nu here</span> <span m='1395000'>was an energy, well, this h times
  nu nought</span> <span m='1400000'>also better be an  energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1405000'>It is the threshold energy. Let's draw an energy level</span> <span
  m='1412000'>diagram to try to understand that.</span> </p><p><span m='1416000'>I
  am going to plot an energy here.</span> </p><p><span m='1420000'>Let's draw an energy
  level for an electron.</span> </p><p><span m='1424000'>This is an electron, here,
  bound to the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='1429000'>And we know that it takes some
  energy to rip this electron off</span> <span m='1436000'>of the metal. Up here,
  at higher energy,</span> <span m='1441000'>is going to be our free electron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1443000'>I will just call it electron-free,</span> <span m='1446000'>not
  bound to the metal anymore. And the energy that is required</span> <span m='1451000'>to
  pull the electron off, from the bound state to its</span> <span m='1455000'>free
  state, is this threshold energy, h times nu nought.</span> </p><p><span m='1460000'>This
  threshold energy is like</span> <span m='1463000'>an ionization potential. You know
  what the ionization</span> <span m='1467000'>potential is. Just the energy required
  to</span> <span m='1472000'>pull an electron off an atom or a molecule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1475000'>However, when we are pulling an electron off a chunk of a metal,</span>
  <span m='1480000'>we actually have another name for it.</span> </p><p><span m='1483000'>It
  is called the work function. That is just historical,</span> <span m='1487000'>but
  it is the same thing as an ionization potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1491000'>And
  we often give it the symbol phi.</span> </p><p><span m='1494000'>That threshold
  energy, ionization energy for a metal,</span> <span m='1498000'>is the work function,
  here, h times nu,</span> <span m='1501000'>phi. The important point here is</span>
  <span m='1506000'>this. In order to get an electron off</span> <span m='1511000'>of
  the metal, what you have to have is</span> <span m='1517000'>energy, E sub i. That
  energy E sub i has to be</span> <span m='1524000'>equal to at least the threshold
  energy, h times nu nought.</span> </p><p><span m='1532000'>If you come in with energy
  of</span> <span m='1537000'>this radiation, of this wavelength and that</span> <span
  m='1541000'>frequency, you pulled the electron off,</span> <span m='1545000'>and
  then the electron is off the metal and it just kind of</span> <span m='1550000'>stays
  there. It doesn't move away.</span> </p><p><span m='1553000'>But you can also come
  in with energy here, E sub i,</span> <span m='1557000'>that is greater than this
  work function, than the threshold</span> <span m='1563000'>energy. And you can pull
  the electron</span> <span m='1567000'>off. But then, the electron is</span> <span
  m='1569000'>actually going to move away from the metal, and the energy with</span>
  <span m='1574000'>which it moves away from the metal, its kinetic energy,</span>
  <span m='1578000'>is just the incident energy minus this threshold energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1583000'>It is the excess energy here. And I am going to write it
  as</span> <span m='1587000'>the kinetic energy. From that energy level diagram,</span>
  <span m='1593000'>this energy, the incident energy,</span> <span m='1597000'>has
  to be equal to the work function, h nu nought,</span> <span m='1603000'>plus the
  kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1608000'>Or, if I turned this around, the
  kinetic energy is equal to</span> <span m='1614000'>the incident energy minus h
  nu nought.</span> </p><p><span m='1622000'>The actual expression for the energy
  that Einstein found,</span> <span m='1626000'>I just turned that equation around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1628000'>This is an equation that you have to know.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1631000'>I will not give this to you on an exam.</span> </p><p><span m='1634000'>Now,
  you don't have to memorize it.</span> </p><p><span m='1637000'>You just have to
  reason it. Draw yourself an energy</span> <span m='1641000'>diagram. You know conservation
  of</span> <span m='1643000'>energy. The sum of these two energies</span> <span m='1646000'>has
  to equal the incident energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>Then you will be all
  set. Now, what is very important</span> <span m='1657000'>here is the following.
  If I come in with radiation</span> <span m='1664000'>that is, say, a half of the
  threshold energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1670000'>Suppose I come in with two photons,
  where each photon is</span> <span m='1678000'>one half h nu --</span> <span m='1688000'>The
  bottom line is that you are not going to get an electron</span> <span m='1692000'>off.
  Even though you are coming in</span> <span m='1695000'>with two photons, which together
  are going to</span> <span m='1699000'>give you the threshold energy, you won't get
  a photon off.</span> </p><p><span m='1703000'>You have to come in with at least
  the energy of the work</span> <span m='1708000'>function. A photon has to have at
  least</span> <span m='1713000'>this energy to get an electron off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1717000'>That is the particle-like nature of radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='1722000'>Energy
  comes in chunks, in particles of energy,</span> <span m='1727000'>in quanta of energy.
  Likewise, if I came in here</span> <span m='1733000'>with a photon that had twice
  the energy of the work function or</span> <span m='1740000'>the threshold energy,
  I would still only get one</span> <span m='1745000'>electron off. I would not get
  two electrons</span> <span m='1751000'>off, even though energetically you would
  be able,</span> <span m='1755000'>in principle, to get two electrons off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1759000'>But you won't. You will only get one electron</span> <span
  m='1763000'>off. Whenever you send a photon in,</span> <span m='1766000'>if it has
  enough energy, that is if its energy is equal</span> <span m='1771000'>to or greater
  than the work function, you will get an</span> <span m='1775000'>electron off. There
  is one electron for every</span> <span m='1780000'>photon. You never get two electrons
  for</span> <span m='1784000'>every photon, or you can never get one</span> <span
  m='1788000'>electron for two photons that are lower energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1792000'>That is the particle quantum nature of radiation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1796000'>That is important. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1808000'>What is the
  form of the photon? What do you mean by form?</span> </p><p><span m='1818000'>Oh,
  you want a picture of the photon.</span> </p><p><span m='1825000'>You're looking
  at them. You cannot draw a picture of a</span> <span m='1833000'>photon because
  you want to relate it to something that is</span> <span m='1839000'>within your
  classical experience.</span> </p><p><span m='1842000'>And you cannot do that. It
  isn't a classical particle.</span> </p><p><span m='1848000'>That is what you're
  working with right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1853000'>You are trying to use your
  experiences, that are everyday</span> <span m='1859000'>experiences, to explain
  something that isn't within your</span> <span m='1865000'>everyday experiences.
  You don't have a frame or a</span> <span m='1873000'>format to do that. Yeah?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1890000'>Yes. If you have a constant flux of</span> <span m='1893000'>photons
  onto the surface, you will have a constant flux</span> <span m='1899000'>of electrons.
  Now, there is a probability.</span> </p><p><span m='1904000'>It is not necessarily
  the case that every photon gets in,</span> <span m='1910000'>will eject electrons,
  because there are other kinds</span> <span m='1916000'>of competing processes. Whatever
  the rate with which</span> <span m='1922000'>the photons come in. It depends on
  the flux of the</span> <span m='1927000'>photons. And we will have some problems</span>
  <span m='1931000'>like that, where we are going to assume that the probability of</span>
  <span m='1937000'>the electron coming off is going to be one, so one electron for</span>
  <span m='1943000'>every photon. But, in reality,</span> <span m='1946000'>there
  are competing processes. Are all electrons being</span> <span m='1952000'>ejected?
  Actually, some electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='1955000'>Again, this goes to the
  probability.</span> </p><p><span m='1959000'>Some are actually kind of going in,
  too, into deeper the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='1973000'>Not the probability,
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='1975000'>The rate at which the electrons come out
  with is dependent on</span> <span m='1981000'>the intensity. The more photons you
  send in,</span> <span m='1986000'>the larger the number of photons per second coming
  in,</span> <span m='1992000'>the larger the number of electrons per second coming
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='1998000'>This is a plot, here, of the energy of the</span>
  <span m='2003000'>electrons. That's all right.</span> </p><p><span m='2006000'>Other
  questions? Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='2015000'>Eventually. Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2016000'>Absolutely. There are other problems that</span> <span m='2019000'>will
  come in. Usually, your light source</span> <span m='2023000'>isn't so energetic
  that you could possibly do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2028000'>Now, also usually
  what happens is that you've got your metal</span> <span m='2033000'>grounded, so
  that as you lose electrons, new electrons come in</span> <span m='2038000'>and fill
  it up to the fermi level.</span> </p><p><span m='2043000'>And so you don't charge
  up your sample.</span> </p><p><span m='2046000'>In an experiment, if you had your
  metal just not</span> <span m='2050000'>grounded and you did shine some radiation,
  what would happen is</span> <span m='2055000'>the metal would start to charge up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2058000'>Then, that would make it difficult to get electrons off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2063000'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2075000'>Yes. How strongly
  those electrons</span> <span m='2077000'>are bound to the metal depends on the electronic
  structure of</span> <span m='2082000'>the metal. And we are going to talk a</span>
  <span m='2084000'>little bit about what determines the strength of the interaction</span>
  <span m='2089000'>for electrons on atoms and molecules, but it is similar to</span>
  <span m='2093000'>what it is for metals. That is coming in a few days.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2097000'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2104000'>Yes, there is. Right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2105000'>You don't actually have to have a metal.</span> </p><p><span m='2108000'>You
  could do it. There are usually higher</span> <span m='2111000'>frequencies on insulators
  and semiconductors,</span> <span m='2114000'>right. It is harder to see the effect,</span>
  <span m='2117000'>but it can be done and has been done.</span> </p><p><span m='2119000'>Well,
  what I want to do right now is to show you an experiment</span> <span m='2124000'>we
  are going to do. We are going to do a</span> <span m='2127000'>photoelectron experiment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2145000'>And the experiment is this. We have a device up here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2153000'>What we have is an aluminum plate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2160000'>And that aluminum plate is mounted on this blue metal rod.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2165000'>And in the middle of this rod is a needle on a pivot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2170000'>And this is a fairly frictionless pivot.</span> </p><p><span m='2174000'>This
  black ring, here, is just a support</span> <span m='2177000'>structure, an insulating
  support structure.</span> </p><p><span m='2182000'>What we are going to do is put
  some excess charge on this</span> <span m='2187000'>aluminum plate. And that excess
  charge is going</span> <span m='2192000'>to run down this metal rod and then onto
  this needle.</span> </p><p><span m='2195000'>And because that excess charge, the
  electrons on the needle and</span> <span m='2200000'>the electrons on the metal
  rod are repulsive,</span> <span m='2203000'>since this is rather frictionless,</span>
  <span m='2205000'>that needle is going to move because of the repulsive</span> <span
  m='2209000'>interactions between these electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2212000'>What
  we're then going to do is try to do the photoelectron</span> <span m='2216000'>experiment.
  We are going to take some UV</span> <span m='2220000'>radiation and shine it on
  this metal and drive the electrons</span> <span m='2227000'>off. And we should see,</span>
  <span m='2229000'>then, the needle swing back to its original position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2234000'>I need a couple of volunteers in order to do this experiment</span>
  <span m='2240000'>here. Come on up.</span> </p><p><span m='2242000'>All right. Fantastic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2244000'>I think that is all right. Good.</span> </p><p><span m='2247000'>Okay.
  One of you needs to be the</span> <span m='2252000'>charger, and the other needs
  to be the discharger.</span> </p><p><span m='2255000'>Which one? You want to discharge?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2258000'>Discharge, okay. You come over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2261000'>And what you are going to do is discharge the aluminum plate</span>
  <span m='2265000'>after we get some excess charge on it.</span> </p><p><span m='2268000'>You
  are going to do it just by holding it up to here.</span> </p><p><span m='2272000'>You
  have to get it kind of close because it is not a very</span> <span m='2277000'>intense
  UV source. Could you get the video cam on</span> <span m='2283000'>the side or on
  the center to get where we are putting it?</span> </p><p><span m='2289000'>I guess
  we are putting it on the side, right?</span> </p><p><span m='2293000'>Okay. There
  we go.</span> </p><p><span m='2295000'>There is the device. You are the charger.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2299000'>What we are going to do, to get the excess charge,</span>
  <span m='2304000'>we are taking a piece of natural fur.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>We
  are going to rub it on this Lucite rod.</span> </p><p><span m='2313000'>You have
  to keep your fingers on the yellow tape here.</span> </p><p><span m='2317000'>And
  we are going to transfer some of the natural oils here</span> <span m='2321000'>onto
  this rod. And there are plenty of</span> <span m='2324000'>negative ions around
  here and free electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2327000'>That oil likes those negative
  charges, and so there are going</span> <span m='2332000'>to be excess negative charges
  on this Lucite rod.</span> </p><p><span m='2337000'>And then you are going to come
  over here and just touch the</span> <span m='2343000'>edge of this and let the electrons
  flow onto there.</span> </p><p><span m='2348000'>Are you right-handed? You have
  to rub that really,</span> <span m='2353000'>really hard. [LAUGHTER] Great.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2356000'>Go over there. Touch the end.</span> </p><p><span m='2359000'>Cool.
  Why don't you give it another</span> <span m='2363000'>jolt here and we will really
  move that needle over.</span> </p><p><span m='2370000'>Okay. Discharger.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2371000'>We have to give it another jolt.</span> </p><p><span m='2373000'>That
  is okay. You may have touched it with</span> <span m='2376000'>something else and
  discharged it a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='2380000'>No, that's okay. You
  have to get the hang of</span> <span m='2383000'>this, here. You are doing fantastic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2386000'>Take it off. That's what it is.</span> </p><p><span m='2389000'>You
  are holding it on too long. Okay, that is pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='2393000'>Put
  it in front there. Get it a little bit closer.</span> </p><p><span m='2397000'>Here
  comes the UV radiation. We did it.</span> </p><p><span m='2402000'>Try it again
  really hard. Just touch it.</span> </p><p><span m='2406000'>Take it off. Do it again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2409000'>You need to do it again. You've got to get it right</span>
  <span m='2414000'>here. Not too much,</span> <span m='2416000'>not too little. Okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2418000'>It is doing it. Discharge in front.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2422000'>Electrons off. Now we have to do a control</span> <span m='2427000'>experiment.
  That is, you have got to charge</span> <span m='2433000'>it up again, but now, when
  you put the light there,</span> <span m='2438000'>what I am going to do is hold
  up a Pyrex plate in between the</span> <span m='2444000'>light and the metal. It
  is going to block the</span> <span m='2449000'>radiation, and it should not discharge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2453000'>You need to get on there. Fantastic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2457000'>There it goes. Here is the plate.</span> </p><p><span m='2462000'>Get
  it to a little bit lower. Do a good discharge.</span> </p><p><span m='2467000'>[APPLAUSE]
  Fantastic. Thank you very much.</span> </p><p><span m='2472000'>Thank you for being
  a good sport.</span> </p><p><span m='2475000'>That is the photoelectron experiment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2479000'>Hey, it works. Well, what I want to do now is</span> <span
  m='2484000'>just spend a few minutes working on a few problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2492000'>I think these are pretty straightforward,</span> <span m='2496000'>but
  I just want to make sure that everybody is on the same</span> <span m='2502000'>page
  here in terms of being able to do the homework.</span> </p><p><span m='2507000'>Here
  is the first problem. The first problem says,</span> <span m='2513000'>how many
  photons? And remember what we said a</span> <span m='2517000'>photon was? E equals
  h nu.</span> </p><p><span m='2522000'>This is the number of joules. Implied is the
  number of joules</span> <span m='2527000'>per photon, although we don't usually
  write this,</span> <span m='2531000'>but that is what that is, joules per photon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2535000'>You may want to write it as you do these problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2540000'>How many photons associated with radiation of a wavelength</span>
  <span m='2548000'>lambda equals one picometer, which is 1.0x10^-12 meters,</span>
  <span m='2555000'>how many of these do you need in order to create,</span> <span
  m='2562000'>say, a laser pulse of energy that is one joule?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2569000'>Lasers are pulsed, so I am talking about a pulse</span> <span m='2575000'>of
  energy, one joule. You want to draw yourself a</span> <span m='2582000'>picture,
  here. We are drawing a picture of one</span> <span m='2586000'>pulse of energy,
  one joule.</span> </p><p><span m='2588000'>Now, we have not been given the frequency,
  here,</span> <span m='2593000'>of this radiation, but we know the wavelength,</span>
  <span m='2597000'>and we know the relationship between frequency and</span> <span
  m='2601000'>wavelength. It is just c over lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='2605000'>I
  know what lambda is. I can calculate nu.</span> </p><p><span m='2610000'>And, when
  I do that, I find that the energy of the</span> <span m='2614000'>photon, hc over
  lambda, that energy of the</span> <span m='2620000'>photon is 1.99x10^-13 joules
  per photon.</span> </p><p><span m='2624000'>And I am using one more figure than
  is significant since this</span> <span m='2630000'>an intermediate step in the calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2635000'>If I want a pulse of one joule of energy and I am asked
  how</span> <span m='2642000'>many photons do I need to get that, and each photon
  is</span> <span m='2650000'>1.99x10^-13 joules, well, that means that I am</span>
  <span m='2656000'>going to need 5.0x10^12 photons. There was a question here?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2664000'>All right. Let's work another one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2670000'>Here, we want to define what we mean by power.</span> </p><p><span m='2674000'>This
  says the power of radiation from the continuous</span> <span m='2680000'>laser is
  three milliwatts.</span> </p><p><span m='2684000'>We have some laser, and the power
  of that radiation</span> <span m='2690000'>coming out is three milliwatts. Well,
  what is power?</span> </p><p><span m='2695000'>Power is energy per unit time. It
  is the energy delivered or</span> <span m='2702000'>the energy expended per unit
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='2706000'>The unit of power that we are going to use
  is a watt.</span> </p><p><span m='2711000'>A watt is a joule per second. We are
  told that we have</span> <span m='2716000'>radiation of three milliwatts. That is
  3.0x10^-3 joules per</span> <span m='2722000'>second. And the question asks,</span>
  <span m='2725000'>how long will it take for a total energy of one joule to be</span>
  <span m='2730000'>supplied? Well, one joule.</span> </p><p><span m='2736000'>And
  we have the rate of energy supply as 3x10^-3 joules per</span> <span m='2747000'>second.
  That gives us 330 seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='2754000'>That is straightforward.
  Finally, we have one more.</span> </p><p><span m='2764000'>It says, how many photons
  per second of, again,</span> <span m='2771000'>the same radiation, of the wavelength
  of one</span> <span m='2777000'>picometer. That means, again,</span> <span m='2782000'>we
  are dealing with photons that have an energy of</span> <span m='2789000'>1.99x10^-13
  joules per photon. How many photons per second,</span> <span m='2799000'>the rate
  of photons at the wavelength do you have to have,</span> <span m='2805000'>or do
  you have, if the power of the radiation</span> <span m='2809000'>is three milliwatts?
  Well, the power of the</span> <span m='2814000'>radiation is 3.0x10^-3 joules per
  second, --</span> <span m='2820000'>-- and we have 1.99x10^-13 joules per photon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2831000'>In order to have this kind of power, what we have to have</span>
  <span m='2838000'>being emitted is 1.5x10^10 photons per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2854000'>All right. The photoelectric effect is one</span> <span m='2858000'>of
  the experiments that demonstrated the particle-like</span> <span m='2863000'>nature
  of light, of radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='2866000'>Particle-like nature because
  you have to have these chunks of</span> <span m='2872000'>energy to make some process
  occur.</span> </p><p><span m='2877000'>Next time, we are going to look at and will
  just talk briefly</span> <span m='2883000'>about the other experiments that demonstrated
  the particle-like</span> <span m='2889000'>nature of radiation. And that other experiment
  is</span> <span m='2894000'>the demonstration that a photon has momentum,</span>
  <span m='2898000'>even though it doesn't have any mass.</span> </p><p><span m='2902562'>See
  you Wednesday. See you Friday.</span> </p>
