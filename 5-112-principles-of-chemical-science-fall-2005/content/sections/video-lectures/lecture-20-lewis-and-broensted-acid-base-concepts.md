  \ <span m='4000'>under a Creative Commons license.</span> <span m='6000'>Additional\
  \ information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in\
  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='24000'>And, that being the\
  \ case,</span> <span m='55000'>I am going to start now by telling you a little bit\
  \ more</span> <span m='59000'>about Lewis theory. Last time we went through</span>\
  \ <span m='63000'>aspects of the cube theory of Lewis and showed how that could</span>\
  \ <span m='68000'>account for single bonds and double bonds,</span> <span m='72000'>but\
  \ not triple bonds. And that when that was</span> <span m='75000'>superseded by\
  \ the electron pair theory, the idea being that</span> <span m='80000'>these electron\
  \ pairs would, in fact, be oriented at the</span> <span m='85000'>vertices of a\
  \ tetrahedron. And I showed you that</span> <span m='90000'>tetrahedron, as described\
  \ in a cube last time,</span> <span m='94000'>that you could then account for triple\
  \ bonds.</span> <span m='97000'>And, if you looked at the notes, you also saw that\
  \ certain</span> <span m='101000'>aspects of the dynamic behavior of certain bond\
  \ types,</span> <span m='106000'>rotation around single bonds, hindered restricted\
  \ rotation</span> <span m='110000'>around double bonds, and so forth.</span> <span\
  \ m='113000'>Those were accounted for by this electron pair theory in</span> <span\
  \ m='117000'>which the four pairs of electrons were oriented at these</span> <span\
  \ m='121000'>vertices of a tetrahedron. So, that was another quite</span> <span\
  \ m='126000'>important triumph of that part of Lewis's theory.</span> <span m='130000'>And\
  \ the problem was, although that electron pair</span> <span m='133000'>theory initially\
  \ put forward by Lewis was so successful at</span> <span m='137000'>accounting for\
  \ the properties of many different kinds of</span> <span m='141000'>molecules and\
  \ was a good description of their electronic</span> <span m='145000'>structure,\
  \ there was one class of molecules,</span> <span m='149000'>a very important class\
  \ of molecules, namely those known as</span> <span m='153000'>aromatic.</span> <span\
  \ m='160000'>And the most important member of the class of aromatic</span> <span\
  \ m='164000'>compounds is, in fact, the benzene molecule.</span> <span m='168000'>Benzene\
  \ has the formula C six H six.</span> <span m='172000'>And we can easily calculate\
  \ the number of valence electrons in</span> <span m='178000'>benzene if we just\
  \ say 4 for carbon times 6,</span> <span m='182000'>plus 1 times 6 for the number\
  \ of valance electrons from each</span> <span m='187000'>of the six hydrogens. And\
  \ that is 30 electrons.</span> <span m='193000'>So, in trying to understand how\
  \ these 30 electrons in a valence</span> <span m='198000'>shell of benzene hold\
  \ this molecule together,</span> <span m='202000'>it is known to be a planar molecule,\
  \ how do those electrons</span> <span m='206000'>not only hold it together, --</span>\
  \ <span m='210000'>-- but how do they account for the structure of benzene,</span>\
  \ <span m='216000'>and how do they account for its amazing stability?</span> <span\
  \ m='222000'>And this picture that I have drawn here is a representation</span>\
  \ <span m='228000'>of benzene, I will explain to you in a moment,</span> <span m='234000'>but\
  \ it comes from a person by the name of Ernest C.</span> <span m='239000'>Crocker.</span>\
  \ <span m='253000'>Ernest C. Crocker was an MIT Bachelor of</span> <span m='257000'>Science\
  \ degree holder, who earned that degree in 1917.</span> <span m='263000'>He was\
  \ an MIT undergraduate like you.</span> <span m='268000'>And he published a paper.\
  \ Let me write down the reference</span> <span m='272000'>for that paper.</span>\
  \ <span m='283000'>This is the Journal of the American Chemical Society,</span>\
  \ <span m='295000'>1922, Volume 44, Page 1618.</span> <span m='302000'>That paper\
  \ was the first paper in which the Lewis electron pair</span> <span m='307000'>theory\
  \ was applied to an understanding of the electronic</span> <span m='312000'>structure\
  \ of aromatic molecules, in particular,</span> <span m='315000'>benzene. And the\
  \ amazing thing about</span> <span m='318000'>that paper is -- Well, there are many\
  \ amazing</span> <span m='323000'>things, but one of the amazing things about that\
  \ paper is that</span> <span m='328000'>there is only one author on that paper,\
  \ Ernest C.</span> <span m='331000'>Crocker. And Ernest, who was a very</span> <span\
  \ m='334000'>bright individual, nonetheless did not go on in</span> <span m='338000'>graduate\
  \ school to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry,</span> <span m='341000'>had many various\
  \ chemistry-related interests.</span> <span m='345000'>He explained the chemistry\
  \ of many different kinds of</span> <span m='349000'>fragrances and odors. I think\
  \ he was referred to as</span> <span m='353000'>\"the man with the million dollar\
  \ nose.\"</span> <span m='358000'>So, this person had quite a variety of interests.</span>\
  \ <span m='361000'>He worked in what was then the Applied Chemistry Laboratory at</span>\
  \ <span m='365000'>MIT after his graduation with his Bachelor of Science degree.</span>\
  \ <span m='369000'>And one of the things he was thinking about was how to use</span>\
  \ <span m='372000'>modern electronic structure descriptions,</span> <span m='375000'>such\
  \ as Lewis theory, to explain molecules like</span> <span m='378000'>benzene. And\
  \ so, if you go and read this</span> <span m='382000'>paper, you are going to find\
  \ a very lucid discussion of how the</span> <span m='388000'>Lewis electron pair\
  \ theory could represent benzene according to</span> <span m='393000'>this formula\
  \ that I have drawn here.</span> <span m='397000'>And in this formula, there is\
  \ considered to be an</span> <span m='401000'>electron pair between each carbon\
  \ and each of the hydrogen</span> <span m='406000'>nuclei. There is an electron\
  \ pair along</span> <span m='409000'>each carbon-carbon axis, as shown here,</span>\
  \ <span m='413000'>and here, and so on, all the way around the ring.</span> <span\
  \ m='419000'>And then, finally, you have six more electrons to</span> <span m='423000'>come\
  \ up to the number of 30, which is the number of</span> <span m='427000'>electrons\
  \ in benzene. And so, the question really is</span> <span m='431000'>what to do\
  \ with this remaining six electrons.</span> <span m='435000'>And I have shown them\
  \ around the outside of the ring,</span> <span m='440000'>here, which is where Ernest\
  \ arranged them in his work.</span> <span m='444000'>And I just want to point out\
  \ that he put forward the idea</span> <span m='449000'>that these six electrons\
  \ were circulating around the plane of</span> <span m='454000'>the ring and involved\
  \ a net one-half bond between each pair</span> <span m='459000'>of adjacent carbon\
  \ atoms in the benzene ring.</span> <span m='465000'>So, in effect, when we draw\
  \ benzene this way,</span> <span m='468000'>with a circle in the middle, we know\
  \ that that circle</span> <span m='472000'>represents the circulating six electrons\
  \ in what we are going</span> <span m='477000'>to call the pi system. But Ernest\
  \ C.</span> <span m='481000'>Crocker was the man who put the circle into the middle\
  \ of</span> <span m='485000'>benzene. And he was an MIT undergrad.</span> <span\
  \ m='488000'>And this was a sole-authored paper.</span> <span m='491000'>Aromaticity\
  \ has a vast history in chemistry,</span> <span m='494000'>and it is still a very\
  \ active and unfolding history because of</span> <span m='499000'>the problems,\
  \ to our understanding,</span> <span m='502000'>posed by electrons that seem to\
  \ be circulating around a whole</span> <span m='507000'>molecule rather than localized\
  \ between pairs of nuclei.</span> <span m='513000'>So, Ernest Crocker, Bachelor\
  \ of Science,</span> <span m='516000'>1917, MIT, had a huge hand in that.</span>\
  \ <span m='519000'>I thought you might find that interesting.</span> <span m='522000'>And,\
  \ having looked at benzene rings like that,</span> <span m='526000'>I will now draw\
  \ them perhaps another way that is also useful,</span> <span m='531000'>which comes\
  \ from Kekul\xC8.</span> <span m='548000'>Because I want to continue our discussion\
  \ of Lewis acid-base</span> <span m='550000'>theory. And I am going to draw two</span>\
  \ <span m='551000'>molecules here that are going to be pretty similar.</span> <span\
  \ m='575000'>When I write a molecule, as I have done here on the</span> <span m='579000'>left,\
  \ I haven't explicitly indicated each of the hydrogens</span> <span m='584000'>that\
  \ are present on the periphery of this substituted</span> <span m='588000'>benzene\
  \ ring. But you should understand from</span> <span m='592000'>a formula like this\
  \ that this is the molecule boron C 18 H 15.</span> <span m='598000'>And over here\
  \ I am drawing</span> <span m='602000'>explicitly, at each of these peripheral positions\
  \ on the</span> <span m='608000'>substituted benzene rings, fluorine atoms in place\
  \ of the</span> <span m='614000'>hydrogens. So, this is a different</span> <span\
  \ m='617609'>molecule with formula B C 18 F</span> <span m='622000'>These are both\
  \ Lewis acids.</span> <span m='633000'>And based on our discussion, last time, if\
  \ you were to add</span> <span m='638000'>ammonia to one of these molecules, where\
  \ would the lone</span> <span m='643000'>pair of electrons on the ammonia bind?</span>\
  \ <span m='646000'>The boron. So, yes, you have here a</span> <span m='649000'>trigonal\
  \ planer boron center. And, if you were to add an</span> <span m='654000'>ammonia\
  \ molecule, the lone pair of electrons</span> <span m='658000'>would come in and\
  \ stick to the boron --</span> <span m='663000'>-- because the boron is electron\
  \ deficient.</span> <span m='667000'>Just like the aluminum we discussed last time,</span>\
  \ <span m='671000'>it has only six electrons around it, and it wants eight.</span>\
  \ <span m='677000'>But what if we were to add one ammonia molecule to a flask</span>\
  \ <span m='683000'>containing both of those Lewis acids that would then be</span>\
  \ <span m='688000'>competing for the ammonia molecule?</span> <span m='698000'>What\
  \ I am asking you to do is something I will ask you to do</span> <span m='702000'>throughout\
  \ this semester, and that is to analyze a</span> <span m='706000'>molecule's properties\
  \ based on its structure and its</span> <span m='710000'>composition.</span> <span\
  \ m='730000'>Exactly. She said that it would</span> <span m='732000'>preferentially\
  \ stick to the one with the fluorines because these</span> <span m='737000'>very\
  \ electronegative fluorines are drawing electron density</span> <span m='741000'>away\
  \ from the boron. This is one of our most</span> <span m='745000'>electronegative\
  \ elements.</span> <span m='763000'>So you have a whole bunch of fluorines in that\
  \ molecule.</span> <span m='766000'>The whole thing, we call it perfluorinated.</span>\
  \ <span m='769000'>It is a perfluorinated triaryl boron reagent.</span> <span m='772000'>These,\
  \ in fact, are great Lewis acids,</span> <span m='775000'>really powerful Lewis\
  \ acids. And they are modern Lewis acids</span> <span m='780000'>whose implementation\
  \ in chemical processes has come about really</span> <span m='785000'>in the last\
  \ 10, 15 years.</span> <span m='787000'>And, in fact we were talking a little bit\
  \ about Professor</span> <span m='791000'>Schrock last time. In some of his research,</span>\
  \ <span m='794000'>he has used that perfluorinated Lewis acid as an activator in</span>\
  \ <span m='799000'>catalysis to get catalytic polymerization reactions to</span>\
  \ <span m='803000'>work. And that is a very popular</span> <span m='805000'>approach\
  \ these days in Lewis acid chemistry.</span> <span m='810000'>The design of new\
  \ kinds of Lewis acids with interesting</span> <span m='813000'>molecular architectures\
  \ is something that is very much a</span> <span m='817000'>current topic of interest\
  \ in research in chemistry,</span> <span m='821000'>because you can make lots of\
  \ chemical processes happen when</span> <span m='825000'>you have something that\
  \ can tug on electron pairs.</span> <span m='828000'>And this one tugs a lot harder\
  \ than that one because this one</span> <span m='832000'>has very electronegative\
  \ fluorines to pull electron</span> <span m='836000'>density away from that boron\
  \ and to adjust the distribution of</span> <span m='840000'>the electron density\
  \ in the molecule.</span> <span m='844000'>And we will be talking more about electron\
  \ density and</span> <span m='847000'>distribution in a few minutes in connection\
  \ with what I am going</span> <span m='851000'>to show you now. And that is --</span>\
  \ <span m='862000'>That has to do with this molecule, which is the SO two</span>\
  \ <span m='867000'>molecule. Anyone know where SO two</span> <span m='872000'>comes\
  \ from in nature? Or in the environment,</span> <span m='877000'>I should say?</span>\
  \ <span m='883000'>Volcanoes, absolutely. And also coal-burning power</span> <span\
  \ m='886000'>plants. Coal is a very dirty fuel,</span> <span m='888000'>and it contains\
  \ a lot of sulfur.</span> <span m='891000'>And, when you burn that coal without\
  \ controlling the way you</span> <span m='895000'>burn it, you emit SO two into\
  \ the atmosphere.</span> <span m='900000'>So, that can be a big problem. And we\
  \ will try to understand</span> <span m='905000'>why. One of the things that SO\
  \ two</span> <span m='907000'>can do when it gets into the atmosphere is it can\
  \ react</span> <span m='913000'>with dioxygen. And that can give you --</span> <span\
  \ m='923000'>-- SO three.</span> <span m='930000'>And if SO two and SO three are\
  \ present in the</span> <span m='935000'>atmosphere and if there is also water present\
  \ in the atmosphere,</span> <span m='941000'>acid rain, that is exactly the type\
  \ of process that we will be</span> <span m='946000'>talking about here. SO two\
  \ and SO three</span> <span m='950000'>are examples of what we call anhydrides.</span>\
  \ <span m='960000'>Anhydride is a word that means without water.</span> <span m='963000'>And\
  \ so you should not be surprised that SO two</span> <span m='968000'>can react with\
  \ water. And when it reacts with water,</span> <span m='972000'>it takes up water.\
  \ And the product of that</span> <span m='975000'>reaction will look like this.</span>\
  \ <span m='997000'>I draw it like that. Okay.</span> <span m='1000000'>So, H two\
  \ O plus SO two going to H two SO three.</span> <span m='1008000'>The name of this\
  \ molecule is</span> <span m='1016000'>sulfurous acid. And, alternatively,</span>\
  \ <span m='1021000'>when SO three reacts with water --</span> <span m='1037000'>I\
  \ have one extra electron pair that should not have been there.</span> <span m='1042000'>So,\
  \ both SO two and SO three,</span> <span m='1045000'>as they react with water, are\
  \ going from a situation in</span> <span m='1050000'>which they are electron deficient\
  \ to a situation in</span> <span m='1054000'>which the sulfur attains an octet.</span>\
  \ <span m='1064000'>Okay? And you should verify that the</span> <span m='1066000'>number\
  \ of electrons that I have drawn up here actually is</span> <span m='1069000'>consistent\
  \ with the elements that I am using with the stated</span> <span m='1073000'>charge\
  \ that I am using. But when SO three</span> <span m='1076000'>reacts with H two\
  \ O to give H two SO four,</span> <span m='1079000'>we have now got sulfuric acid.</span>\
  \ <span m='1088000'>Okay. And, as I did over there,</span> <span m='1091000'>I have\
  \ two acids that I want here now to compare in terms of</span> <span m='1097000'>their\
  \ relative strengths. Here I have a Lewis acid SO</span> <span m='1102000'>three\
  \ and a Lewis acid SO two engaging in a</span> <span m='1108000'>hydration reaction,\
  \ which produces sulfurous acid</span> <span m='1114000'>and sulfuric acid. And\
  \ the type of acids that</span> <span m='1119000'>these are on the bottom is Bronsted\
  \ acids,</span> <span m='1122000'>--</span> <span m='1128000'>-- distinguished from\
  \ Lewis acids in that the way that they</span> <span m='1133000'>behave as acids\
  \ is through ionization that produces a</span> <span m='1138000'>proton. They are\
  \ also Lewis acids</span> <span m='1142000'>because the Lewis definition of acidity\
  \ is far more general,</span> <span m='1146000'>in saying that acids are simply\
  \ entities that can accept a pair</span> <span m='1151000'>of electrons. Protons\
  \ can accept a pair of</span> <span m='1155000'>electrons, so they are Lewis acids.</span>\
  \ <span m='1157000'>But if you are talking about Bronsted acids,</span> <span m='1161000'>you\
  \ are talking exclusively about protons that are produced</span> <span m='1166000'>by\
  \ ionization of some kind of a Bronsted acid.</span> <span m='1171000'>Which one\
  \ of these is the stronger acid?</span> <span m='1178000'>Sulfuric acid. And why?</span>\
  \ <span m='1190000'>Yes, down here. You got the other one right.</span> <span m='1200000'>Exactly.\
  \ When this ionizes,</span> <span m='1202000'>you get SO four minus.</span> <span\
  \ m='1205000'>I will draw is a slightly different way that is quicker.</span> <span\
  \ m='1210000'>You get HSO four minus.</span> <span m='1213000'>There is your ionization.\
  \ And the idea now is that this O</span> <span m='1219000'>minus that you have,\
  \ the negative charge can</span> <span m='1223000'>actually be shared among a greater\
  \ number of</span> <span m='1227000'>electronegative oxygens here, namely four,</span>\
  \ <span m='1231000'>as compared to here, where we have only three</span> <span m='1236000'>electronegative\
  \ oxygens. It is a consideration of the</span> <span m='1242000'>very electronegative\
  \ elements in your molecule that will help you</span> <span m='1247000'>understand\
  \ the properties that these molecules will have in</span> <span m='1251000'>terms\
  \ of acid-base chemistry. Now, how many electrons do we</span> <span m='1255000'>have\
  \ in the valance shell of SO three?</span> <span m='1263000'>what molecule from\
  \ last time does that remind you of?</span> <span m='1280000'>Maybe seeing a picture\
  \ of it will help refresh your memory.</span> <span m='1287000'>AlCl three. Exactly.</span>\
  \ <span m='1290000'>I am going to show it to you anyway.</span> <span m='1294000'>And\
  \ this is going to be faster than the last time,</span> <span m='1300000'>if I set\
  \ this up right. Just to remind you.</span> <span m='1305000'>And if we could have\
  \ the lights down just a little bit for a</span> <span m='1312000'>moment.</span>\
  \ <span m='1323000'>I want to refresh your memory of the electron density</span>\
  \ <span m='1326000'>distribution here in AlCl three.</span> <span m='1329000'>This\
  \ is an electron density isosurface of AlCl three.</span> <span m='1332000'>And\
  \ what you are noticing is</span> <span m='1334000'>that the electron density drops\
  \ to a low value in between the</span> <span m='1338000'>central aluminum and the\
  \ radially disposed chlorides,</span> <span m='1341000'>the three chlorides that\
  \ surround that central aluminum</span> <span m='1345000'>ion. And the coloring\
  \ in this is</span> <span m='1347000'>such that the blue regions represent regions\
  \ in space where</span> <span m='1351000'>there is a high probability of finding\
  \ paired electrons.</span> <span m='1356000'>So, basically you have three Cl minus's\
  \ that are packed tightly</span> <span m='1360000'>around an Al three plus.</span>\
  \ <span m='1362000'>This is a very ionic compound. See the empty region in space</span>\
  \ <span m='1366000'>between aluminum and chloride, and the polarization of that</span>\
  \ <span m='1370000'>otherwise spherical cloud of electrons around the chloride in</span>\
  \ <span m='1374000'>the direction of that positively charged aluminum?</span> <span\
  \ m='1377000'>There is your electron density distribution for that.</span> <span\
  \ m='1382000'>And now I want you to keep that in mind, and we will compare the</span>\
  \ <span m='1386000'>isoelectronic SO three molecule to it.</span> <span m='1401000'>SO\
  \ three. Here is another case where we</span> <span m='1404000'>have 3 times 8,\
  \ 24 valance electrons in a</span> <span m='1407000'>system. But the character of\
  \ this</span> <span m='1409000'>molecule in terms of electron density distribution\
  \ is very</span> <span m='1413000'>different. While on the blackboard,</span> <span\
  \ m='1417000'>I am not able to really tell you very much about the</span> <span\
  \ m='1421000'>difference between SO three and AlCl three,</span> <span m='1425000'>here\
  \ I think you can see that indeed they are quite</span> <span m='1430000'>different.\
  \ This is an electron density</span> <span m='1433000'>isosurface at the same contour\
  \ level as what we were looking at</span> <span m='1438000'>for AlCl three. Now,\
  \ to explain this and to</span> <span m='1443000'>understand just what is going\
  \ on here, you need to remember that</span> <span m='1448000'>the electronegativity\
  \ difference between the central sulfur and</span> <span m='1452000'>the peripheral\
  \ oxygens is not very great compared to the</span> <span m='1456000'>electronegativity\
  \ difference between aluminum,</span> <span m='1459000'>which is a very electropositive\
  \ and metallic element,</span> <span m='1463000'>and chlorine, which is a very electronegative</span>\
  \ <span m='1466000'>halogen. And so, what that results in,</span> <span m='1470000'>as\
  \ shown here, is a much more equal sharing of</span> <span m='1473000'>the electrons\
  \ between that central sulfur and these</span> <span m='1476000'>peripheral oxygens.\
  \ So, even though these things</span> <span m='1480000'>are both Lewis acids and\
  \ they both have 24 valance electrons,</span> <span m='1484000'>the electron density\
  \ distribution in</span> <span m='1486000'>three-dimensional space for these molecules\
  \ and the covalent</span> <span m='1491000'>verses ionic character of these molecules,\
  \ is really quite</span> <span m='1495000'>different.</span> <span m='1505000'>Our\
  \ section that is going to be devoted to bonding has not</span> <span m='1509000'>really\
  \ kicked into gear yet, but the nice thing is that</span> <span m='1513000'>Lewis\
  \ theory applies both to acid-base chemistry and to</span> <span m='1516000'>bonding,\
  \ so we are able to talk a little bit about that.</span> <span m='1520000'>In a\
  \ few moments, I will tell you a little more</span> <span m='1524000'>about an issue\
  \ that is very important in chemistry as</span> <span m='1527000'>regards bonding.</span>\
  \ <span m='1536000'>And it has to do with what happens when acids,</span> <span\
  \ m='1542000'>like sulfuric acid, ionize in water.</span> <span m='1546000'>When\
  \ Bronsted acids ionize in water, we get this ion produced.</span> <span m='1555000'>H\
  \ three O plus, which is the hydronium ion.</span> <span m='1570000'>That is to\
  \ say that if you ionize in water some Bronsted</span> <span m='1573000'>acid, the\
  \ protons that are produced through that ionization</span> <span m='1578000'>are\
  \ not floating around freely, naturally, because they are</span> <span m='1582000'>positively\
  \ charged and they are attracted to negatively charged</span> <span m='1586000'>electrons.\
  \ So, they look around in</span> <span m='1589000'>solution and find the next source\
  \ of an electron that they</span> <span m='1593000'>can. And you know that if we\
  \ draw</span> <span m='1595000'>out a molecule like water, according to the Lewis\
  \ dot</span> <span m='1599000'>structure, it has two extra pairs of electrons,</span>\
  \ <span m='1602000'>in addition to those two pairs of electrons it is using in</span>\
  \ <span m='1606000'>making bonds to the two hydrogens that are on the oxygen</span>\
  \ <span m='1610000'>of the water molecule. So, H plus is not just</span> <span m='1614000'>isolated\
  \ around by itself in solution.</span> <span m='1618000'>It perches on an oxygen\
  \ lone pair.</span> <span m='1621000'>So, H three O plus is what you get when Bronsted\
  \ acids</span> <span m='1627000'>ionize in water. And furthermore,</span> <span\
  \ m='1630000'>when you put these things in solution you find that you</span> <span\
  \ m='1636000'>organize the water molecules that are close to the hydronium</span>\
  \ <span m='1642000'>ion. Let's draw here a neighboring</span> <span m='1645000'>water\
  \ molecule.</span> <span m='1653000'>And another one.</span> <span m='1658000'>And\
  \ I think you can imagine that throughout a solution,</span> <span m='1663000'>we\
  \ might have many of the kinds of interactions that I have</span> <span m='1668000'>drawn\
  \ here as dotted peach-colored lines.</span> <span m='1672000'>Those lines represent\
  \ what we call hydrogen bonds.</span> <span m='1676000'>And hydrogen bonds are enormously\
  \ important in</span> <span m='1681000'>chemistry. Later, when we talk about the</span>\
  \ <span m='1685000'>structure of proteins in DNA, in particular,</span> <span m='1688000'>you\
  \ may be aware that the DNA double helix is held together by</span> <span m='1692000'>a\
  \ network of hydrogen bonds between complimentary base</span> <span m='1696000'>pairs.\
  \ So hydrogen bonds are not only</span> <span m='1699000'>restricted to the hydronium\
  \ ion in aqueous solution.</span> <span m='1703000'>There are many other types of\
  \ molecules that can form what we</span> <span m='1707000'>call hydrogen bonds.\
  \ Another really interesting</span> <span m='1712000'>thing is that in water, the\
  \ hydronium ion can move</span> <span m='1717000'>around really rapidly, much more\
  \ rapidly than</span> <span m='1721000'>molecules normally diffuse through aqueous\
  \ solution.</span> <span m='1726000'>And the reason for that is if you look at the\
  \ arrangement of</span> <span m='1731000'>electrons and nuclei here, all I have\
  \ to do is,</span> <span m='1736000'>without even moving the nuclei much at all,\
  \ reorganize the</span> <span m='1741000'>hydrogen bonding network as such.</span>\
  \ <span m='1752000'>And now you can see that through just a slight set of</span>\
  \ <span m='1755000'>motions, our hydronium ion has moved from the left-hand side\
  \ of</span> <span m='1760000'>this hydrogen bonded network, where you can see that\
  \ it is</span> <span m='1764000'>indicated with the positive charge and the three\
  \ solid lines</span> <span m='1768000'>drawn to the oxygen, over to the right-hand\
  \ side.</span> <span m='1773000'>But it did that not by coming off and moving over,</span>\
  \ <span m='1776000'>but rather through just redistribution of the electron</span>\
  \ <span m='1780000'>density, so that the positively charged part ends up down on\
  \ the</span> <span m='1785000'>other side. And so this way of propagating</span>\
  \ <span m='1788000'>hydronium ions in aqueous solution is one of the really</span>\
  \ <span m='1792000'>special aspects of Bronsted acid chemistry that takes place\
  \ in</span> <span m='1796000'>water. And I think I will also show</span> <span m='1800000'>you\
  \ what a hydrogen bond looks like from the standpoint of</span> <span m='1804000'>electron\
  \ density.</span> <span m='1818000'>First, I am just going to show you the position\
  \ of the nuclei</span> <span m='1821000'>in a very simple hydrogen bonded system.</span>\
  \ <span m='1837000'>Here what you can see, the oxygens are drawn in red as</span>\
  \ <span m='1840000'>spheres and the hydrogens are drawn in white as spheres.</span>\
  \ <span m='1844000'>You can see that the geometry around the oxygen atoms is</span>\
  \ <span m='1848000'>slightly pyramidal. And that is due,</span> <span m='1851000'>of\
  \ course, to the presence of that extra lone pair here,</span> <span m='1855000'>up\
  \ above one oxygen and here, up above the other oxygen.</span> <span m='1860000'>And\
  \ what we have now is a hydrogen serving in a bridging</span> <span m='1864000'>fashion.\
  \ And the number of electrons in</span> <span m='1867000'>this system is exactly\
  \ 2 times 8, because we have two water</span> <span m='1871000'>molecules and we\
  \ have an H plus.</span> <span m='1874000'>So this is a positively charged ion in\
  \ which a hydronium ion,</span> <span m='1878000'>and you can pick either side,\
  \ actually, is interacting with</span> <span m='1883000'>one of the lone pairs of\
  \ the other water molecule.</span> <span m='1888000'>And you could imagine lots\
  \ of different types of water</span> <span m='1891000'>clusters like this that are\
  \ singly positively charged.</span> <span m='1894000'>And people have done a lot\
  \ of work to study such clusters in</span> <span m='1898000'>solution. What you\
  \ should remember,</span> <span m='1900000'>though, is that the size of the spheres\
  \ that I have drawn there</span> <span m='1904000'>to represent those oxygens and\
  \ hydrogens is somewhat arbitrary.</span> <span m='1908000'>But what is not arbitrary\
  \ is the way that the electron</span> <span m='1911000'>density represents a molecule\
  \ like this.</span> <span m='1913000'>So, we will show that to you next.</span>\
  \ <span m='1933000'>Here it is. And if we could have the lights</span> <span m='1935000'>down\
  \ just a little bit, please, since this one is a</span> <span m='1939000'>little\
  \ harder to see. What you should see here is</span> <span m='1942000'>that we have\
  \ the same structure now surrounding that</span> <span m='1946000'>representation\
  \ of the water molecule hydrogen bonded to the</span> <span m='1950000'>hydronium\
  \ ion that I drew a moment ago.</span> <span m='1954000'>We now have this sort of\
  \ mesh, which is exactly what we have</span> <span m='1958000'>been looking at with\
  \ these other molecules, namely,</span> <span m='1961000'>an electron density isosurface.\
  \ And what you can see is that</span> <span m='1966000'>the electron density is\
  \ falling to a pretty small value in the</span> <span m='1970000'>middle, here,\
  \ where we have the proton that</span> <span m='1973000'>is the connecting glue\
  \ binding together these two water</span> <span m='1977000'>molecules in this 16\
  \ valance electron system.</span> <span m='1982000'>And after one more representation\
  \ of that,</span> <span m='1986000'>we will be onto our next topic.</span> <span\
  \ m='2000000'>And this one is a solid display of the electron density</span> <span\
  \ m='2004000'>isosurface associated with this hydrogen bonded cluster.</span> <span\
  \ m='2010000'>And it is, once again, color mapped with this function</span> <span\
  \ m='2014000'>that tells us about the probability of finding electrons</span> <span\
  \ m='2019000'>paired up together in space. There is H three O plus</span> <span\
  \ m='2023000'>hydrogen bonded to H two O.</span> <span m='2027000'>The blue color\
  \ represents those regions in space where you are</span> <span m='2032000'>most\
  \ likely to find pairs of electrons.</span> <span m='2035000'>And you can see that\
  \ the two OH bonds over here are nicely</span> <span m='2040000'>colored blue. The\
  \ lone pair of electrons up</span> <span m='2045000'>here is nicely colored blue.\
  \ And then we have an interesting</span> <span m='2049000'>situation where there\
  \ is some blue in between that bridging H</span> <span m='2054000'>plus and the\
  \ two lone pairs that are pointed at it</span> <span m='2058000'>that produces,\
  \ in fact, our hydrogen bond.</span> <span m='2061000'>So, there is a picture of\
  \ hydrogen bonding in terms of</span> <span m='2065000'>electron density. And it\
  \ is a type of bonding</span> <span m='2070000'>that compliments the straight, covalent,\
  \ and ionic bonding</span> <span m='2075000'>that I was talking about in terms of\
  \ SO three and</span> <span m='2081000'>AlCl three. So, we have added this third</span>\
  \ <span m='2085000'>type of hydrogen bonding to our list of bonding interests.</span>\
  \ <span m='2090000'>And now, we will talk more about what we can do when we</span>\
  \ <span m='2095000'>consider Bronsted acids ionizing.</span> <span m='2115000'>Here\
  \ is a generic representation of the formula of</span> <span m='2120000'>a Bronsted\
  \ acid, HA.</span> <span m='2122000'>A might be, for example, the HSO four minus</span>\
  \ <span m='2128000'>ion that we showed over there. When we put a Bronsted acid in</span>\
  \ <span m='2134000'>aqueous solution, as I said before,</span> <span m='2136000'>we\
  \ can get ionization into H plus and A minus.</span> <span m='2139000'>But we know\
  \ that it is not just</span> <span m='2141000'>H plus. It is actually H three O\
  \ plus</span> <span m='2144000'>**H3O^+**. And H three O plus is</span> <span m='2146000'>further\
  \ hydrogen bonded in networks in the water system.</span> <span m='2150000'>But,\
  \ for simplicity, I will just write it as H plus</span> <span m='2153000'>right\
  \ here. Recently, in your crash review</span> <span m='2157000'>of thermodynamics,\
  \ you were talking about</span> <span m='2160000'>equilibria and equilibrium constants.</span>\
  \ <span m='2163000'>And we are going to make use of some of that right here because</span>\
  \ <span m='2169000'>we are going to talk about the acidity constant,</span> <span\
  \ m='2172000'>Ka. And that is going to be defined</span> <span m='2175000'>as equal\
  \ to the hydrogen or hydronium ion concentration</span> <span m='2180000'>times\
  \ the concentration of the conjugate base,</span> <span m='2184000'>A minus -- When\
  \ a Bronsted acid ionizes it</span> <span m='2189000'>produces what we call the\
  \ conjugate base of the acid.</span> <span m='2194000'>Here is conjugate base --</span>\
  \ <span m='2205000'>-- divided by the concentration of the acid.</span> <span m='2209000'>And\
  \ this is at equilibrium.</span> <span m='2219000'>And let me just emphasize something\
  \ so that you don't</span> <span m='2222000'>forget. This is an important piece\
  \ of</span> <span m='2225000'>nomenclature. These square brackets here</span> <span\
  \ m='2228000'>refer to concentration, usually in molarity.</span> <span m='2239000'>Okay?\
  \ So that is what we are talking</span> <span m='2241000'>about. And concentration\
  \ is something</span> <span m='2244000'>that can be measured. You may be familiar,</span>\
  \ <span m='2248000'>for example, with the pH meter invented by</span> <span m='2251000'>Arnold\
  \ O. Beckman and its utility in</span> <span m='2254000'>measuring the concentration\
  \ of hydrogen ions in solution.</span> <span m='2260000'>Well, we can make use of\
  \ information like that to talk</span> <span m='2263000'>about the properties of\
  \ our Bronsted acids.</span> <span m='2274000'>How can we do that? Well, let's say\
  \ we are going to</span> <span m='2280000'>take a particular acid such as this one,\
  \ which is acetic acid.</span> <span m='2294000'>You know the smell of acetic acid\
  \ if you have ever been in an</span> <span m='2299000'>establishment where they\
  \ were making barbecued chicken wings.</span> <span m='2304000'>That is the smell\
  \ of acetic acid.</span> <span m='2307000'>A beautiful smell. Anyway, what you do\
  \ here is you</span> <span m='2312000'>are trying to figure out what is going on.</span>\
  \ <span m='2315000'>You have some concentration of the acid HA, which is,</span>\
  \ <span m='2320000'>we are going to talk about, acetic acid.</span> <span m='2323000'>And\
  \ in solution there may also be a hydrogen ion or a hydronium</span> <span m='2328000'>ion.\
  \ And then there may also be A</span> <span m='2331000'>minus, which in the case\
  \ of acetic acid would be acetate,</span> <span m='2335000'>--</span> <span m='2342000'>--\
  \ where we have two electronegative oxygens,</span> <span m='2346000'>among which\
  \ the negative charge can be shared and the acetate</span> <span m='2351000'>ion,\
  \ which is the conjugate base of acidic acid.</span> <span m='2355000'>So we make\
  \ a table. We need to have some initial</span> <span m='2360000'>concentration.\
  \ That is to say let's consider,</span> <span m='2364000'>for example, tenth molar\
  \ acetic acid.</span> <span m='2367000'>We are just choosing tenth molar as a concentration\
  \ for</span> <span m='2372000'>acetic acid solution. What that means is you have</span>\
  \ <span m='2378000'>pure acetic acid. And then you dissolve it in</span> <span m='2382000'>water\
  \ and bring it up to a total volume such that the</span> <span m='2386000'>concentration\
  \ was 0.1 molar, assuming that none of it had</span> <span m='2391000'>been ionized\
  \ yet. And so that means we have an</span> <span m='2394000'>initial concentration\
  \ of acetic acid of 0.1 molar.</span> <span m='2400000'>And initially, before the\
  \ ionization,</span> <span m='2403000'>we have zero H plus or hydronium and zero\
  \ A minus.</span> <span m='2408000'>And then, the concentration</span> <span m='2412000'>changes.\
  \ And it changes because the HA</span> <span m='2415000'>ionizes to some particular\
  \ extent, depending on the KA</span> <span m='2420000'>value for the acetic acid.\
  \ And what is going to happen is</span> <span m='2426000'>that some of the HA ionizes.\
  \ And the amount of the HA that</span> <span m='2432000'>is undergoing ionization\
  \ is x, so we are going to lose x.</span> <span m='2437000'>And then, for every\
  \ HA that ionizes, we get that same amount</span> <span m='2442000'>of H plus produced\
  \ and that same amount of A minus.</span> <span m='2446000'>And so then,</span>\
  \ <span m='2448000'>after the system reaches equilibrium, we will finally</span>\
  \ <span m='2453000'>have 0.1 minus x as our concentration of HA</span> <span m='2457000'>and\
  \ x and x will be our concentrations,</span> <span m='2461000'>respectively, of\
  \ H plus and A minus.</span> <span m='2464000'>And so let me put this board</span>\
  \ <span m='2470000'>all the way up.</span> <span m='2478000'>Therefore, we can write\
  \ the following, that Ka is equal to x</span> <span m='2484000'>squared over 0.1\
  \ over x by</span> <span m='2489000'>substituting into the expression for the acidity\
  \ constant.</span> <span m='2495000'>Ka is our acidity constant.</span> <span m='2506000'>And\
  \ we can go to a table and look up the acidity constant for</span> <span m='2512000'>acetic\
  \ acid because it is a known quantity.</span> <span m='2517000'>And it turns out\
  \ that that is 1.8x10^-5.</span> <span m='2523000'>And now that we have this equation\
  \ for the acidity</span> <span m='2526000'>constant and we know what the acidity\
  \ constant is,</span> <span m='2529000'>we can solve this for x. Of course, this\
  \ is a cubic</span> <span m='2533000'>equation. We are going to get two roots.</span>\
  \ <span m='2535000'>You will see that you get a positive root and a negative</span>\
  \ <span m='2539000'>root. The negative root is</span> <span m='2541000'>meaningless\
  \ because concentration cannot be</span> <span m='2544000'>negative, so you pick\
  \ the positive root.</span> <span m='2548000'>And when you have done that, you can\
  \ then go ahead and</span> <span m='2553000'>answer questions, like, what is the\
  \ pH of the</span> <span m='2557000'>solution? And what is the percent</span> <span\
  \ m='2560000'>ionization?</span> <span m='2567000'>And we can talk about that. So\
  \ next time,</span> <span m='2569000'>at the beginning of class, we will do that\
  \ calculation.</span> <span m='2571000'>We will find what the pH of a tenth molar\
  \ solution of acetic</span> <span m='2574000'>acid would be. We will also go on\
  \ and talk</span> <span m='2577000'>about pH and the pKa scale, and also a general\
  \ equation for</span> <span m='2580381'>discussing titrations and buffers.</span>\
