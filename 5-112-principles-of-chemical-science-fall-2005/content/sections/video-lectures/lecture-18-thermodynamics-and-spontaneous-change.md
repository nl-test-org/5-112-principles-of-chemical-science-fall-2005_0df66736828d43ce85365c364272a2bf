  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>I am going to continue
  our blitz through a review of</span> <span m='20000'>thermodynamics. And we are
  going to start,</span> <span m='24000'>right now, talking about spontaneous change.</span>
  </p><p><span m='30000'>And you all know what spontaneous change means.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34000'>It means some change that occurs without intervention.</span> </p><p><span
  m='38000'>Spontaneous change has a directionality to it.</span> </p><p><span m='42000'>For
  example, if you put a rock at the top of</span> <span m='46000'>a hill and you let
  go, it rolls down,</span> <span m='49000'>it doesn't roll up. If you put a warm
  body next to</span> <span m='54000'>a hot body, the heat flows from the hot body
  to the cold body,</span> <span m='59000'>and not the other way. If you, for example,</span>
  <span m='64000'>have a bulb of gas here and a stop-cock and an empty bulb,</span>
  <span m='68000'>you open the stop-cock, that gas flows from the high</span> <span
  m='72000'>pressure region to the low pressure region,</span> <span m='75000'>and
  it does not go the other way.</span> </p><p><span m='78000'>However, spontaneous
  change does not have to be fast.</span> </p><p><span m='82000'>You know that if
  you take a bottle of ketchup,</span> <span m='85000'>when it used to be a glass
  bottle that you couldn't</span> <span m='89000'>squeeze, and you turn it over, that
  ketchup has a spontaneous</span> <span m='94000'>tendency to flow out. But it does
  not have to be</span> <span m='99000'>fast. What is, in chemical reactions,</span>
  <span m='102000'>the key to spontaneity? Is it the exothermicity?</span> </p><p><span
  m='106000'>Well, certainly iron rusts. You don't have to do anything</span> <span
  m='111000'>to make it rust. A very exothermic reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='115000'>Delta
  H is about 824 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>If you have an
  acidic stomach and you then ingest something</span> <span m='125000'>that is a little
  bit more basic, well, this reaction goes.</span> </p><p><span m='130000'>It neutralizes
  that acid, also an exothermic reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='135000'>You did not
  have to do anything other than drink the more basic</span> <span m='141000'>solution.
  This reaction,</span> <span m='143000'>here, this hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, adenosine
  diphosphate,</span> <span m='148000'>-- -- proceeds in every cell of</span> <span
  m='152000'>your body, and you don't have to do anything to make that go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='157000'>That is an exothermic reaction. But what about an endothermic</span>
  <span m='162000'>reaction? How about this reaction?</span> </p><p><span m='165000'>This
  is ammonium nitrate dissolving in water to make</span> <span m='170000'>ammonium
  ions and nitrate ions. The delta H for this reaction</span> <span m='175000'>is
  positive, plus 25.7 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='180000'>It is an
  endothermic reaction. Is this reaction spontaneous?</span> </p><p><span m='185000'>Well,
  yes. We are going to do an</span> <span m='187000'>experiment anyway. And the experiment
  we are going</span> <span m='191000'>to do is, you are going to be given one of
  these cold packs.</span> </p><p><span m='197000'>And the TAs can start distributing
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='200000'>What you have to do is find the little pouch
  inside the cold</span> <span m='205000'>pack that contains the water. You have to
  press on that,</span> <span m='211000'>allowing the water to disperse in the material,</span>
  <span m='215000'>and you will see if the reaction goes.</span> </p><p><span m='218000'>If
  it goes, that cold pack better get cold because this is</span> <span m='223000'>an
  endothermic reaction. It is going to remove some heat</span> <span m='227000'>from
  the environment. Some of you will get hot packs,</span> <span m='232000'>and we
  will see if that is spontaneous.</span> </p><p><span m='235000'>Is an endothermic
  reaction spontaneous?</span> </p><p><span m='240000'>Yes. Is an exothermic reaction</span>
  <span m='243000'>spontaneous? Yes, right.</span> </p><p><span m='246000'>Is delta
  H the key to spontaneity?</span> </p><p><span m='250000'>No. What is?</span> </p><p><span
  m='252000'>Delta G, right. So, delta G is the key to</span> <span m='257000'>spontaneity.
  You already know that when</span> <span m='261000'>delta G is negative, you have
  a spontaneous</span> <span m='267000'>reaction. When delta G is positive,</span>
  <span m='272000'>you have a non-spontaneous reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='275000'>And
  very importantly, when delta G is zero,</span> <span m='278000'>that is when you
  are at equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='281000'>That is what we are going to
  be talking about in just a few</span> <span m='287000'>minutes, when delta G is
  equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='290000'>These are the conditions, of course,
  for constant</span> <span m='294000'>temperature and pressure. Delta S, in this
  expression for</span> <span m='299000'>delta G, is the change in the entropy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='304000'>It is a measure of disorder. When delta S is positive,</span>
  <span m='308000'>we have an increase in the disorder.</span> </p><p><span m='312000'>When
  delta S is negative, we have a decrease in the</span> <span m='316000'>disorder.
  Where do these conditions come</span> <span m='320000'>from? You are going to talk
  about</span> <span m='323000'>that in exquisite detail in 5.60, but I want to give
  you a</span> <span m='328000'>physical understanding for what delta G is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='334000'>And that is this. Suppose you have an exothermic</span>
  <span m='338000'>reaction. It turns out that not all of</span> <span m='341000'>that
  exothermicity, not all of that enthalpy,</span> <span m='344000'>can be released
  to the outside world to do useful work.</span> </p><p><span m='349000'>Some of that
  enthalpy is actually caught up in the</span> <span m='353000'>product molecules,
  or can be caught up in the</span> <span m='357000'>product molecules. Some of that
  enthalpy gets</span> <span m='362000'>stuck in the product molecules. It gets stuck
  in the vibrations</span> <span m='367000'>and rotations of the product molecules
  in the internal</span> <span m='372000'>degrees of freedom. It is that energy that
  is not</span> <span m='376000'>available to do useful work. For some exothermic
  reactions,</span> <span m='381000'>here, the amount of energy that is available
  to do useful work</span> <span m='387000'>is something smaller than delta H.</span>
  </p><p><span m='391000'>It is delta H minus T delta S, where T delta S,</span> <span
  m='395000'>then, is a measure of how much of that enthalpy is stuck in the</span>
  <span m='400000'>internal degrees of freedom of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='404000'>And so, this delta G is called the free energy because this is</span>
  <span m='410000'>the amount of energy that is free to do useful work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='414000'>That is what delta G is. For example,</span> <span m='419000'>if you
  go home and turn on your gas stove, oxidize some methane,</span> <span m='424000'>burn
  some natural gas to heat up the water for your pasta,</span> <span m='430000'>that
  delta H is very negative. But let's now calculate delta</span> <span m='435000'>G.
  Well, to do that,</span> <span m='437000'>we need to know what delta S is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='440000'>Delta S, I will show you in just a moment,</span> <span
  m='444000'>is the change in the entropy. We can calculate that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='450000'>But knowing delta S then, we can plug in the delta H and</span> <span
  m='455000'>the temperature. What we find is that delta G</span> <span m='459000'>here
  is less negative than delta H.</span> </p><p><span m='463000'>Not all of this enthalpy,
  not all of that energy is</span> <span m='468000'>available to the outside world
  to do useful work.</span> </p><p><span m='472000'>Some of it, in this reaction,
  gets trapped or caught in the</span> <span m='478000'>internal degrees of freedom
  of a molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='484000'>And it is not available to do that
  useful work.</span> </p><p><span m='488000'>Delta G, in this case, is less negative
  than delta H.</span> </p><p><span m='492000'>But let's take the eat, breathe, exhale,</span>
  <span m='495000'>pee reaction. The oxidation of glucose,</span> <span m='499000'>going
  on in every cell of your body, this reaction also very</span> <span m='504000'>exothermic.
  Let's calculate delta G for</span> <span m='507000'>this reaction. Well, first of
  all,</span> <span m='511000'>we need delta S. From that, we can calculate</span>
  <span m='515000'>delta G. And, in this case,</span> <span m='518000'>what do you
  see? In this case,</span> <span m='520000'>you see that delta G is more negative
  than delta H.</span> </p><p><span m='525000'>In this exothermic reaction, we are
  getting back all of the</span> <span m='531000'>enthalpy and then some. We are getting
  back even more.</span> </p><p><span m='535000'>And that extra energy is coming from
  the energy that is tied up</span> <span m='541000'>in the internal degrees of freedom
  of the reactants.</span> </p><p><span m='548000'>In this reaction, here, delta S
  is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='551000'>We are increasing the disorder. If we
  increase the disorder,</span> <span m='557000'>there are fewer ways to tie up energy
  in the internal degrees</span> <span m='562000'>of freedom of the molecule. When
  we increase the disorder,</span> <span m='567000'>that is what happens. And so,
  your body has figured</span> <span m='573000'>out how to get back all of that delta
  H, and then some.</span> </p><p><span m='579000'>We are getting that energy out
  that is locked up in the</span> <span m='585000'>reactants, in the internal degrees
  of freedom of the</span> <span m='591000'>reactants. That is a physical feeling,</span>
  <span m='595000'>there, for what delta G is. Entropy for a reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='602000'>The entropy is calculated from the absolute entropies of the</span> <span
  m='606000'>products and the reactants. And so, what you need are the</span> <span
  m='610000'>absolute entropies for each one of the products multiplied by</span>
  <span m='615000'>the appropriate stoichiometric number.</span> </p><p><span m='618000'>You
  sum them all up. And you do the same then for</span> <span m='622000'>the reactants,
  the absolute entropy of each</span> <span m='625000'>one of the reactants multiplied
  by that stoichiometric number.</span> </p><p><span m='629000'>Sum them up. Subtract
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='632000'>That is the entropy change for the reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='636000'>Now, one thing I do want to point out is that in the case
  of</span> <span m='640000'>entropies, here, these are absolute entropies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='643000'>That is rather unusual in thermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='646000'>In thermodynamics usually we look at changes in energies,</span> <span
  m='651000'>but here we are talking about absolute entropies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='654000'>That is a consequence of the third law of thermodynamics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='660000'>You will see how that arises again in 5.60,</span> <span m='664000'>but
  right now we are going to use it to calculate the entropy</span> <span m='669000'>for
  a reaction. And some reactions here are</span> <span m='674000'>completely entropy-driven.
  For example,</span> <span m='677000'>if you melt ice, this is an endothermic</span>
  <span m='681000'>reaction, 6.95 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='684000'>In
  going from solid water to liquid water,</span> <span m='688000'>you have to put
  energy into the system to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='695000'>But you know that
  this reaction occurs spontaneously.</span> </p><p><span m='699000'>If I had a cube
  of ice here, it would melt.</span> </p><p><span m='703000'>This reaction is entropy-driven.</span>
  </p><p><span m='705000'>Why? Let's look at it.</span> </p><p><span m='707000'>Let's
  calculate delta S for that reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='711000'>You need the
  absolutely entropy for water in the liquid phase,</span> <span m='716000'>that is
  the product, minus the absolute entropy for</span> <span m='720000'>water in the
  solid phase. The difference between the two</span> <span m='727000'>is positive.
  We have increased the disorder.</span> </p><p><span m='731000'>There are less ways
  to tie up energy in liquid water than</span> <span m='737000'>there are in solid
  water, in ice.</span> </p><p><span m='741000'>And that fact is going to make this
  reaction then spontaneous,</span> <span m='747000'>6.95 positive for delta H minus
  T delta S.</span> </p><p><span m='753000'>This term, T delta S, now is larger in
  absolute</span> <span m='757000'>magnitude. Therefore, delta G is negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='762000'>This reaction is spontaneous. It is certainly entropy-driven.</span>
  </p><p><span m='768000'>The other concept I want to talk about is the free energy
  of</span> <span m='775000'>formation, which is analogous to what we talked about
  last time,</span> <span m='782000'>the enthalpy of formation. The free energy of
  formation is</span> <span m='789000'>the free energy for a reaction that forms one
  mole of a</span> <span m='794000'>compound from the elements in their most stable
  form in the</span> <span m='799000'>standard state. And our standard state is one</span>
  <span m='804000'>bar. The free energy of formation,</span> <span m='807000'>here,
  is tabulated like the heats of formation.</span> </p><p><span m='813000'>You can
  find tables of free energy and enthalpy of formation</span> <span m='818000'>for
  all molecules. However, unlike the enthalpy of</span> <span m='823000'>formation,
  the free energy of formation can also be calculated</span> <span m='829000'>easily
  by you, which is the following,</span> <span m='833000'>if you know the enthalpy
  of formation for some reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='840000'>Or, for the reaction
  that defines the enthalpy of</span> <span m='844000'>formation. And if you know
  what the</span> <span m='847000'>entropy change is for that reaction that defines
  the</span> <span m='852000'>enthalpy of formation, then you can calculate the free</span>
  <span m='857000'>energy here of formation. You have two choices in the</span> <span
  m='861000'>case of the free energy of formation.</span> </p><p><span m='865000'>You
  can look it up. Or, if you know what delta H</span> <span m='870000'>sub f and delta
  S are for the reaction,</span> <span m='875000'>that defines the free energy of
  formation or the enthalpy of</span> <span m='881000'>formation. You can calculate
  the free</span> <span m='885000'>energy of formation, here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='887000'>Here is a reaction that forms one mole of CO two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='893000'>And the delta G for this reaction is minus 394 kilojoules</span> <span
  m='898000'>per mole. The delta G for this reaction</span> <span m='903000'>is defined
  as the free energy of formation for CO two.</span> </p><p><span m='909000'>It is
  so because we are forming one mole of this molecule from</span> <span m='914000'>the
  elements in their most stable form in the standard</span> <span m='919000'>state.
  The most stable form of the</span> <span m='922000'>element carbon is graphite.
  The most stable form of the</span> <span m='926000'>element oxygen is molecular
  oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='931000'>But what is important about the free energy
  of formation,</span> <span m='936000'>here, is that it is a measure of a compound
  stability relative</span> <span m='942000'>to decomposition to its elements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='946000'>For example, the free energy of formation of</span> <span
  m='950000'>carbon dioxide is negative. What that means is CO two</span> <span m='955000'>is
  thermodynamically stable relative to decomposition</span> <span m='961000'>into
  its elements. Because delta G for this</span> <span m='967000'>reaction is written
  as negative. The reaction is spontaneous in</span> <span m='973000'>this direction.
  It is not spontaneous in the</span> <span m='978000'>reverse direction. That is,
  the decomposition of</span> <span m='982000'>CO two to its elements is not a spontaneous
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='988000'>Therefore, we say that CO two is thermodynamically
  stable</span> <span m='994000'>relative to decomposition into its elements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1000000'>If you have a free energy of formation for a molecule that
  is</span> <span m='1004000'>negative, it is thermodynamically stable,</span> <span
  m='1007000'>but if you have a free energy of formation that is positive,</span>
  <span m='1012000'>then that compound is not thermodynamically stable</span> <span
  m='1016000'>relative to decomposition to its elements.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>For
  example, let's look at benzene.</span> </p><p><span m='1023000'>Here is a reaction
  that forms one mole of liquid benzene from</span> <span m='1029000'>the elements
  in their most stable form in the standard</span> <span m='1034000'>state, graphite
  and molecular hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>The free energy of formation
  for this benzene is positive</span> <span m='1044000'>kilojoules per mole. That
  means that this forward</span> <span m='1051000'>reaction, as written, is not spontaneous.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1056000'>However, the reverse reaction is spontaneous because delta
  G</span> <span m='1063000'>is minus 124 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1067000'>And so we say benzene, here, is thermodynamically</span> <span m='1072000'>unstable
  relative to its elements.</span> </p><p><span m='1078000'>But, even though you might
  have a reaction, here,</span> <span m='1082000'>that is spontaneous, that is the
  reverse reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1088000'>You have a delta G formation that
  is positive,</span> <span m='1092000'>meaning the reverse reaction is spontaneous.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1097000'>Even though that reverse reaction may be spontaneous,</span>
  <span m='1102000'>it also could be very, very slow.</span> </p><p><span m='1107000'>When
  was the last time you saw a pint of benzene decompose into</span> <span m='1112000'>graphite
  and hydrogen? You haven't seen that.</span> </p><p><span m='1117000'>I haven't seen
  that and I am a lot older.</span> </p><p><span m='1120000'>What this means is that
  even though you might have a</span> <span m='1125000'>thermodynamic tendency to
  compose, it does not mean that</span> <span m='1130000'>it is going to happen because
  there is a question of the rate</span> <span m='1136000'>of the chemical reaction.
  We have two different terms to</span> <span m='1142000'>describe the thermodynamic
  tendency and then the kinetic</span> <span m='1148000'>tendency, and these terms
  are the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1152000'>We call the molecules stable
  or unstable when we are referring</span> <span m='1158000'>to the thermodynamic
  tendency. That is when we are referring</span> <span m='1163000'>to delta G or the
  free energy of formation.</span> </p><p><span m='1169000'>If it is negative, the
  molecule is stable.</span> </p><p><span m='1172000'>If it is positive, the molecule
  is unstable</span> <span m='1176000'>relative to decomposition. However, we also
  have to</span> <span m='1181000'>consider the rates. And we have another term to</span>
  <span m='1185000'>describe the rates. And that is labile and</span> <span m='1189000'>non-labile.
  If a molecule is non-labile,</span> <span m='1192000'>what that means is that the
  rate, at which the thermodynamic</span> <span m='1197000'>tendency is realized,
  is very, very slow.</span> </p><p><span m='1203000'>Benzene, for example, is thermodynamically
  unstable</span> <span m='1207000'>relative to decomposition into its elements,</span>
  <span m='1211000'>carbon and hydrogen, but it is non-labile.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1215000'>The rate at which that reaction happens is just too slow to be</span>
  <span m='1221000'>of any practical interest to you.</span> </p><p><span m='1224000'>However,
  if this decomposition reaction occurred very readily,</span> <span m='1230000'>then
  we would call that molecule labile.</span> </p><p><span m='1235000'>That is, the
  rate of the decomposition is something that</span> <span m='1241000'>is going to
  affect your ability to handle that particular</span> <span m='1248000'>compound
  or that molecule. Like the enthalpy of formation,</span> <span m='1255000'>the free
  energy of formation can also be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1262000'>Last time,
  we talked about how the enthalpy of formation for</span> <span m='1267000'>hydrogen,
  oxygen, chlorine, xenon,</span> <span m='1270000'>all of that, had zero enthalpy
  of formation.</span> </p><p><span m='1274000'>Well, all of these molecules have
  zero free energy of</span> <span m='1278000'>formation because they are all in the
  most stable form already,</span> <span m='1284000'>in the standard state. The free
  energy of formation of</span> <span m='1289000'>bromine liquid and mercury liquid
  is</span> <span m='1294000'>zero. Because they are in the most</span> <span m='1298000'>stable
  form at the standard state.</span> </p><p><span m='1301000'>The free energy of formation
  of carbon in the form of graphite,</span> <span m='1306000'>sodium solid,</span>
  <span m='1309000'>iron solid, iodine solid.</span> </p><p><span m='1313000'>Those
  free energies of formation are all equal to zero,</span> <span m='1317000'>but the
  free energy of formation here of bromine in the</span> <span m='1322000'>gas phase
  is not equal to zero. Because bromine gas is not the</span> <span m='1329000'>most
  stable form in our standard state.</span> </p><p><span m='1332000'>Liquid bromine
  is, so it is going to take energy</span> <span m='1337000'>to produce bromine gas.
  So Delta G of formation is not</span> <span m='1343000'>going to be zero. Likewise,
  the free energy of</span> <span m='1347000'>formation of diamond is not equal to
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1353000'>Because carbon, in the form of diamond,</span>
  <span m='1356000'>is not the most stable form of carbon.</span> </p><p><span m='1360000'>Graphite
  is. This is going to take energy to</span> <span m='1364000'>form that configuration
  of carbon.</span> </p><p><span m='1367000'>So free energies of formation are very
  important in terms of</span> <span m='1373000'>understanding the thermodynamic stability
  of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1380000'>Just a review, here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1381000'>If you want to calculate delta G for a reaction,</span> <span m='1385000'>what
  can you do? You can take the free energy of</span> <span m='1388000'>formation for
  each one of the products, multiply it by the</span> <span m='1393000'>appropriate
  stoichiometric number, since those free</span> <span m='1397000'>energies of formation
  are given per mole, add them all up,</span> <span m='1401000'>and then do the same
  thing for the reactants.</span> </p><p><span m='1404000'>Free energies of formation
  for each of the reactants.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>Stoichiometric number.
  Add them all up.</span> </p><p><span m='1412000'>Subtract the two. That is the delta
  G for your</span> <span m='1416000'>chemical reaction. Like delta H for the chemical</span>
  <span m='1420000'>reaction, which you calculated from the differences in the</span>
  <span m='1424000'>heats of formation, the products and reactants,</span> <span m='1428000'>note
  that this is products minus reactants.</span> </p><p><span m='1431000'>This is different
  from when you calculate delta H,</span> <span m='1435000'>for example, from bond
  enthalpies.</span> </p><p><span m='1439000'>That was reactants minus products.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1441000'>Something to remember. But again, in the case of delta</span>
  <span m='1446000'>G, we can calculate it from knowing the free energies of</span>
  <span m='1451000'>formation of the reactants and the products.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1454000'>But we can also calculate it from this expression.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1459000'>If, for example, you know the enthalpy change</span> <span m='1462000'>for
  a reaction and you know the entropy change for a reaction,</span> <span m='1468000'>you
  can calculate the free energy change from these two</span> <span m='1472000'>quantities.
  You have two choices to</span> <span m='1477000'>calculate the free energy change
  of some chemical reaction,</span> <span m='1483000'>depending on what information
  is known or is given to you.</span> </p><p><span m='1489000'>Now, I want to talk
  kind of briefly about controlling the</span> <span m='1495000'>spontaneity of a
  chemical reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1500000'>And, to do so, I am going to
  talk about this</span> <span m='1504000'>molecule, which is sodium bicarbonate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1507000'>Sodium bicarbonate is better known as baking soda.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1512000'>It is what you put into some batter of soft baked goods
  that</span> <span m='1517000'>you want to make. What happens is that the sodium</span>
  <span m='1522000'>bicarbonate decomposes and two of the products are gases,</span>
  <span m='1527000'>CO two and water. And so, in your batter,</span> <span m='1532000'>what
  you get are these bubbles of CO two and water.</span> </p><p><span m='1537000'>And
  what happens is that the dough starts to harden around</span> <span m='1542000'>these
  bubbles. And then, of course,</span> <span m='1545000'>eventually, the CO2 and water
  leave, are completely driven</span> <span m='1549000'>off, but what that leaves
  behind in the batter is a very porous</span> <span m='1554000'>structure, so porous
  that after you remove it from the oven you</span> <span m='1559000'>can actually
  put your teeth into it.</span> </p><p><span m='1564000'>Have you ever left out the
  baking soda in some soft baked</span> <span m='1568000'>goods? You cannot get your
  teeth into</span> <span m='1572000'>it, right? So, this is an important</span> <span
  m='1575000'>reaction. But this is a reaction,</span> <span m='1578000'>here, that
  is very endothermic. It does increase in the</span> <span m='1582000'>entropy, but
  at room temperature, this reaction has a</span> <span m='1587000'>positive delta
  G. This reaction does not proceed.</span> </p><p><span m='1593000'>It is non-spontaneous
  in the forward direction,</span> <span m='1597000'>as written. And that is good
  because you do</span> <span m='1601000'>not want this reaction to start when your
  batter is still on</span> <span m='1607000'>your kitchen counter. You want it to
  start when it is</span> <span m='1613000'>in the oven. What happens as we raise
  the</span> <span m='1617000'>temperature, here? For the purposes of what we are</span>
  <span m='1622000'>going to do, we have the same delta H and delta S.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1627000'>But now, when we calculate delta G, the temperature,</span> <span m='1631000'>here,
  is going to be our baking temperature of 350 degrees</span> <span m='1636000'>Fahrenheit.
  And now, what you see is delta</span> <span m='1640000'>G is negative, minus 14
  kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1644000'>All of a sudden, this reaction
  became</span> <span m='1647000'>spontaneous. And we made it spontaneous</span> <span
  m='1653000'>simply by increasing the absolute magnitude of T delta S.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1659000'>We increased it by increasing the temperature,</span> <span m='1664000'>in
  this case. We made it spontaneous by</span> <span m='1669000'>raising the temperature.
  For some reactions,</span> <span m='1674000'>we can do that. We can find a temperature
  at</span> <span m='1679000'>which the reaction will be spontaneous.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1685000'>Let's look at the particular conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='1689000'>Delta
  G is a linear function of the temperature,</span> <span m='1694000'>so let me draw
  that for this particular case,</span> <span m='1699000'>for the sodium bicarbonate
  decomposition.</span> </p><p><span m='1704000'>The slope of this line for this reaction
  is, of course,</span> <span m='1710000'>minus delta S. The intercept is delta H.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1715000'>And now, let me just draw a zero here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1719000'>What I want you to notice is that there is some temperature</span> <span
  m='1725000'>that I am going to call T star.</span> </p><p><span m='1729000'>There
  is some temperature at which the sign of delta G</span> <span m='1735000'>changes.
  You see that below T star,</span> <span m='1738000'>delta G is positive. Below those
  temperatures,</span> <span m='1744000'>such as room temperature for the sodium bicarbonate</span>
  <span m='1748000'>decomposition, delta G is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1751000'>We
  have a non-spontaneous reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1754000'>Above some temperature
  delta G has become negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1758000'>We have a spontaneous
  reaction. We can calculate the value of</span> <span m='1763000'>this T star, where
  the spontaneity switches,</span> <span m='1766000'>by setting delta G nought equal
  to zero</span> <span m='1771000'>and then solving for T star. Let's do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1776000'>I rearrange this to give me T star is equal to delta H
  over</span> <span m='1781000'>delta S. For this reaction,</span> <span m='1783000'>I
  know the values of delta H and delta S.</span> </p><p><span m='1786000'>And for
  this reaction that value of T star is 406 Kelvin.</span> </p><p><span m='1791000'>So,
  your oven has to be higher in temperature than 406 Kelvin</span> <span m='1796000'>if
  you want to make some baked goods that you can put your</span> <span m='1801000'>teeth
  into. For some reaction,</span> <span m='1806000'>in this particular case here that
  is endothermic,</span> <span m='1811000'>delta H greater than zero, in which case
  we have an</span> <span m='1817000'>increase in entropy, that reaction is spontaneous</span>
  <span m='1822000'>whenever the temperature is above some temperature T star.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1830000'>But we also have reactions which are exothermic,</span>
  <span m='1835000'>delta H less than zero, and reactions in which the</span> <span
  m='1840000'>entropy decreases. Delta S is less than zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1845000'>And
  I have plotted that line here, delta G versus T.</span> </p><p><span m='1851000'>For
  the opposite condition, we have the opposite slope</span> <span m='1857000'>because
  delta S has changed sign.</span> </p><p><span m='1862000'>In this case, the reaction
  will be</span> <span m='1864000'>spontaneous whenever the temperature is below some</span>
  <span m='1868000'>temperature T star. And you can see that by looking</span> <span
  m='1872000'>at the relative signs in this expression.</span> </p><p><span m='1875000'>If
  delta H is less than zero up here, then we have a negative</span> <span m='1880000'>quantity
  right here. And, since delta S is less than</span> <span m='1884000'>zero, we have
  minus times a minus, which is a plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>This term
  here is positive, this term is negative,</span> <span m='1895000'>and so this positive
  term better not be in absolute value</span> <span m='1900000'>very much larger than
  delta H here.</span> </p><p><span m='1904000'>If it is, then we are going to have
  a positive delta G,</span> <span m='1909000'>but if this term is small compared
  to the absolute value</span> <span m='1915000'>of delta H, then we will have a spontaneous
  reaction at low</span> <span m='1921000'>temperatures. So, you want to keep this
  term</span> <span m='1926000'>small. That is why it is spontaneous</span> <span
  m='1929000'>when T is less than T star. But we can also have reactions</span> <span
  m='1934000'>that are exothermic and reactions in which the entropy</span> <span
  m='1938000'>increases. In this case,</span> <span m='1940000'>you have the best
  of all worlds.</span> </p><p><span m='1943000'>In this case, this reaction is spontaneous
  at</span> <span m='1946000'>all temperatures. You cannot adjust the</span> <span
  m='1950000'>spontaneity of this reaction by temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='1955000'>This
  is always going to be negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1957000'>Delta H is negative
  here, minus T delta S.</span> </p><p><span m='1961000'>This is going to be minus
  a positive number.</span> </p><p><span m='1964000'>A negative minus a positive number
  is always a negative</span> <span m='1968000'>number, always spontaneous. And then,
  finally,</span> <span m='1972000'>we can have a condition where we have an endothermic
  reaction,</span> <span m='1977000'>delta H is greater than zero, and where the entropy</span>
  <span m='1980000'>decreases, delta S is less than zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1985000'>In
  this case, the reaction is never</span> <span m='1987000'>spontaneous, no matter
  what temperature you do.</span> </p><p><span m='1991000'>You cannot adjust that
  non-spontaneity with</span> <span m='1994000'>temperature. Delta H, you can see
  that,</span> <span m='1997000'>is going to be positive. And since delta S is negative,</span>
  <span m='2001000'>we have a minus times a minus, that is positive,</span> <span
  m='2005000'>delta G is positive at all temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m='2009000'>So
  we have failed to adjust the spontaneity with temperature for</span> <span m='2014000'>some
  reactions that are endothermic and in which the</span> <span m='2018000'>entropy
  decreases.</span> </p><p><span m='2025000'>What we have been talking about are values
  of delta G that are</span> <span m='2036000'>standard state. We have been talking
  about</span> <span m='2042000'>delta G nought, one bar pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2046000'>That is what we have been talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='2050000'>What
  that means is that the delta G nought for any reaction</span> <span m='2057000'>means
  that we have one atmosphere each of the products</span> <span m='2063000'>and the
  reactants. That is what delta G nought</span> <span m='2068000'>means. That our
  famous reaction here,</span> <span m='2072000'>argon-boron, argon plus boron going
  to</span> <span m='2075000'>carbon plus deuterium. Let's take this reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2079000'>When I give you a delta G nought for this famous reaction,</span>
  <span m='2084000'>what that means is that that is the delta G nought when the</span>
  <span m='2088000'>partial pressure of the reactant A is one bar,</span> <span m='2092000'>and
  the partial pressure of reactant B, is one bar and the</span> <span m='2097000'>partial
  pressure of product C is one bar, and the partial</span> <span m='2102000'>pressure
  of product D is one bar.</span> </p><p><span m='2106000'>That does not seem real
  useful, because say you were going to</span> <span m='2111000'>start a reaction
  and you just start it even with one bar of A</span> <span m='2117000'>and one bar
  of B, this is not the delta G under</span> <span m='2121000'>those particular conditions.
  We have to be able to calculate</span> <span m='2127000'>delta G under any conditions.
  Not just our standard state</span> <span m='2133000'>conditions. And that is what
  we are going</span> <span m='2136000'>to do with this expression. We are going to
  be able to</span> <span m='2141000'>calculate a delta G at any time during a reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2145000'>We can stop a reaction, and we can measure the partial</span>
  <span m='2150000'>pressures of the reactants and the products present,</span> <span
  m='2154000'>and we can get from that, then, a delta G for a reaction</span> <span
  m='2159000'>at that particular point. That is what we are going to</span> <span
  m='2165000'>do, here. What have I got written here?</span> </p><p><span m='2168000'>I
  have delta G is equal to this delta G nought,</span> <span m='2172000'>the standard
  state delta G, plus RT ln of the partial</span> <span m='2176000'>pressure of product
  C over some reference pressure raised to the</span> <span m='2182000'>appropriate
  stoichiometric number, times the partial</span> <span m='2186000'>pressure of the
  other reactant, divided by some reference</span> <span m='2191000'>pressure raised
  to the appropriate stoichiometric</span> <span m='2195000'>number. And that is all
  over the</span> <span m='2199000'>product of the partial pressure of A over that
  reference</span> <span m='2204000'>pressure, raised to the appropriate stoichiometric</span>
  <span m='2209000'>number, times the same for reactant B.</span> </p><p><span m='2213000'>What
  this ratio here of partial pressures is,</span> <span m='2218000'>or what it is
  called, is the reaction quotient,</span> <span m='2222000'>Q. It is the ratio of
  the partial</span> <span m='2226000'>pressures present during any time during the
  reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2231000'>Not necessarily at equilibrium -- at any
  time during the</span> <span m='2235000'>reaction. That is what Q is here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2238000'>And so in this way, with this expression,</span> <span
  m='2241000'>we are going to be able to calculate what delta G is for</span> <span
  m='2246000'>the reaction at any time outside of this special standard state</span>
  <span m='2251000'>of one bar pressure for each one of the reactants,</span> <span
  m='2256000'>one bar partial pressure for each one of the products.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2262000'>Where this expression comes from is, again,</span> <span m='2266000'>discussed
  in exquisite detail in 5.60.</span> </p><p><span m='2270000'>You will see where
  it comes from later, but right now we are</span> <span m='2276000'>going to use
  it to calculate delta G at any time during the</span> <span m='2282000'>reaction.
  But now let me point out that</span> <span m='2286000'>our reference pressure right
  here is one bar.</span> </p><p><span m='2289000'>What I am going to do is substitute
  a one in here for</span> <span m='2293000'>each one of the reference pressures,
  so that my reaction</span> <span m='2298000'>quotient is going to look like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2300000'>And I did not put in the bars because what you are going
  to do</span> <span m='2305000'>is put in the pressures in bars. And then, the reaction
  quotient</span> <span m='2311000'>will be just fine. You have to use bar pressure</span>
  <span m='2315000'>here, since that is our standard state.</span> </p><p><span m='2317000'>That
  is our reference pressure. Now, keep this in mind.</span> </p><p><span m='2322000'>This
  is important. We are going to use this again</span> <span m='2325000'>in just a
  moment. Let's start talking about the</span> <span m='2329000'>equilibrium constant.
  Here is our famous A plus B</span> <span m='2333000'>going to C plus D reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2338000'>We already said if delta G, for this reaction as written
  is</span> <span m='2343000'>negative, then that forward reaction is spontaneous.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2347000'>If delta G for that reaction is positive for the reaction
  as</span> <span m='2353000'>written, what that means is then, the reverse reaction
  is</span> <span m='2358000'>spontaneous. And now, very importantly,</span> <span
  m='2361000'>if delta G is zero, then we are at chemical</span> <span m='2365000'>equilibrium.
  Notice this is delta G equal to</span> <span m='2369000'>zero. This is not delta
  G nought</span> <span m='2373000'>equal to zero. A big difference here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2377000'>This is delta G equal to zero. Then, we are at equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2383000'>What I am going to do is I am going to bring back my</span> <span m='2388000'>expression
  that allowed me to calculate delta G at any</span> <span m='2393000'>arbitrary pressures
  of the reactants and the products.</span> </p><p><span m='2400000'>And I just said
  that equilibrium, here,</span> <span m='2403000'>is defined by delta G being equal
  to zero,</span> <span m='2407000'>so I am going to plug in a zero right in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2411000'>If that is the case, then I am going to rearrange</span>
  <span m='2415000'>this equation. I am going to bring delta G</span> <span m='2419000'>over
  to the other side, and that is what I do here on</span> <span m='2423000'>the next
  slide. I have delta G nought is equal</span> <span m='2427000'>to minus RT ln of
  this reaction quotient.</span> </p><p><span m='2431000'>Now, we have a special</span>
  <span m='2437000'>condition here. And that is when delta G is</span> <span m='2441000'>equal
  to zero, when we are at thermodynamic</span> <span m='2445000'>equilibrium this
  reaction quotient has a special name.</span> </p><p><span m='2451000'>That special
  name is the equilibrium constant,</span> <span m='2456000'>K. This reaction quotient
  is equal</span> <span m='2459000'>to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2465000'>And it is so only when delta G is equal to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2470000'>Not delta G nought equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2473000'>We
  get the equation, delta G nought is equal to</span> <span m='2478000'>minus RT ln
  of K.</span> </p><p><span m='2483000'>That is where this particular expression comes
  from.</span> </p><p><span m='2490000'>So, the reaction quotient is equal to K when
  we are at</span> <span m='2494000'>thermodynamic equilibrium. Now what we are going
  to do is</span> <span m='2499000'>set up some equations here that are going to allow
  us to quickly</span> <span m='2505000'>tell when our reaction is at equilibrium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2508000'>We are going to compare Q to K. Let's do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2512000'>Here is that general expression I had that allowed me to</span> <span
  m='2517000'>calculate delta G at any arbitrary pressures of the</span> <span m='2522000'>reactants
  and the products. Here is the expression delta G</span> <span m='2528000'>nought
  at equilibrium, delta G nought equal minus RT</span> <span m='2532000'>ln of K.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2535000'>What I am going to do is substitute this delta G nought</span>
  <span m='2539000'>into here right in there. Let me do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2542000'>I am just going to plug it right in.</span> </p><p><span m='2545000'>So,
  I have minus RT ln of K plus RT ln of Q.</span> </p><p><span m='2549000'>Now I have
  the difference</span> <span m='2554000'>between two logs. The difference between
  two logs</span> <span m='2559000'>is the log of the quotient of those arguments
  of the logs.</span> </p><p><span m='2565000'>So, delta G then is RT times ln of
  Q over K.</span> </p><p><span m='2570000'>Remember what Q is?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2575000'>It is this ratio of instantaneous partial pressures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2582000'>If we have a reaction running and we somehow measure the</span> <span
  m='2588000'>partial pressures at some time, and we calculate the reaction</span>
  <span m='2595000'>quotient from that and then we find that Q is less than K,</span>
  <span m='2601000'>the equilibrium constant, what that means is that we have</span>
  <span m='2608000'>fewer products present than equilibrium says we should have</span>
  <span m='2614000'>-- -- because Q is less than K.</span> </p><p><span m='2618000'>If
  that is the case, then what is going to happen is</span> <span m='2623000'>that
  the reaction is going to proceed in the forward direction</span> <span m='2629000'>in
  order to make more products, so that Q can get to the point</span> <span m='2635000'>of
  being equal to K. You can also see that up here.</span> </p><p><span m='2641000'>When
  Q is less than K, we had the log of a number that</span> <span m='2646000'>is going
  to be less than one. The log of a number less than</span> <span m='2651000'>one
  is a negative number. When Q is equal to K,</span> <span m='2655000'>delta G is
  going to be negative, meaning,</span> <span m='2659000'>the reaction as written
  is spontaneous in the forward</span> <span m='2664000'>direction. That is what our
  equilibrium</span> <span m='2668000'>says. It wants to make more products.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2672000'>On the other hand, if we have Q greater than K,</span>
  <span m='2676000'>that says we have too many products compared to what</span> <span
  m='2680000'>equilibrium says we should have. And, of course,</span> <span m='2684000'>then
  the reaction is going to run in the reverse direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2689000'>It
  is going to try to use up those products and make more</span> <span m='2694000'>reactant.
  You can also see that by this</span> <span m='2697000'>expression. When Q is greater
  than K,</span> <span m='2702000'>we are going to have a log of a number that is
  greater than one,</span> <span m='2707000'>that is going to be positive. If delta
  G is positive in the</span> <span m='2713000'>forward direction for the reaction
  as written,</span> <span m='2717000'>then it is the reverse reaction that is going
  to be spontaneous.</span> </p><p><span m='2722000'>Another way to look at it is
  shown here.</span> </p><p><span m='2726000'>Suppose we are in a situation where
  Q is less than K.</span> </p><p><span m='2732000'>I am plotting here Q as a function
  of the time in the</span> <span m='2737000'>reaction, and I am starting out here
  at T equals zero and Q is</span> <span m='2744000'>less than K. If Q is less than
  K,</span> <span m='2747000'>it means that we have fewer products than what equilibrium</span>
  <span m='2753000'>tells us we should have. The reaction is going to</span> <span
  m='2758000'>proceed in the forward direction, so that Q will</span> <span m='2764000'>increase
  to the value of K, so that we can attain</span> <span m='2769000'>equilibrium. On
  the other hand,</span> <span m='2773000'>if we have a situation where we start a
  reaction,</span> <span m='2778000'>but Q is greater than K, in that case,</span>
  <span m='2781000'>we started the reaction by putting all the products in</span>
  <span m='2786000'>instead of the reactants. When Q is greater than K,</span> <span
  m='2792000'>it says we have more products than equilibrium says we should</span>
  <span m='2798000'>have. What is going to happen is that</span> <span m='2801000'>the
  reverse reaction is going to proceed.</span> </p><p><span m='2805000'>It is going
  to try to use up those products,</span> <span m='2809000'>so that we attain this
  ratio given by the equilibrium</span> <span m='2814000'>constant. That is how we
  are going to use</span> <span m='2818000'>Q, compare it to K to determine whether
  or not we are at</span> <span m='2824000'>chemical equilibrium. Professor Cummins
  will be here</span> <span m='2828000'>on Wednesday. I will see you later in the</span>
  <span m='2832755'>week.</span> </p>
