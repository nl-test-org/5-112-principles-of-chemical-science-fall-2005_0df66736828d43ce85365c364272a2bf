  \ information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in\
  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>On Monday, we went\
  \ through and looked at the functional forms</span> <span m='19000'>for sp two hybrid\
  \ orbitals, as found in the case</span> <span m='22000'>of the BH three molecule.</span>\
  \ <span m='25000'>Now, you should recognize that there are other hybridization</span>\
  \ <span m='29000'>schemes that go along with different geometries.</span> <span\
  \ m='33000'>So, BH three was trigonal planar.</span> <span m='35000'>And we are\
  \ going to talk some more about BH three today.</span> <span m='38000'>If you had\
  \ been considering last time instead a tetrahedral</span> <span m='42000'>carbon\
  \ atom, then the hybridization scheme we would</span> <span m='45000'>have needed\
  \ to develop would have been the sp three</span> <span m='49000'>hybridization scheme.\
  \ That would be associated with a</span> <span m='52000'>tetrahedral carbon atom.\
  \ On the other hand,</span> <span m='56000'>if we had a linearly coordinated carbon\
  \ atom or some</span> <span m='59000'>other main group atom, boron or beryllium,</span>\
  \ <span m='62000'>for example, then we would have had to</span> <span m='65000'>develop\
  \ the sp hybridization scheme.</span> <span m='68000'>You should not miss the forest\
  \ for the trees in putting into</span> <span m='72000'>context from my previous\
  \ lecture on the sp two specific</span> <span m='76000'>case for that type of geometry.\
  \ But now, rather than going</span> <span m='82000'>through more examples of valance\
  \ bond theory treatments of</span> <span m='87000'>molecules, instead, it is time\
  \ for me to introduce</span> <span m='92000'>you to the tenants of the molecular\
  \ orbital theory for</span> <span m='96000'>treatment of molecular electronic structure.</span>\
  \ <span m='100000'>I mentioned valance bond theory as having been introduced by</span>\
  \ <span m='106000'>Linus Pauling. And then, I also named Robert</span> <span m='110000'>S.\
  \ Mulliken, MIT undergraduate,</span> <span m='112000'>as the father of molecular\
  \ orbital theory.</span> <span m='118000'>And these are both two different perspectives\
  \ on</span> <span m='121000'>viewing electron structure of molecules that arises\
  \ from the</span> <span m='126000'>results of quantum mechanics. In the case of\
  \ valance bond</span> <span m='131000'>theory, we have a situation where you have\
  \ localized</span> <span m='136000'>electron pairs.</span> <span m='144000'>In the\
  \ case of molecular orbital theory,</span> <span m='146000'>electron pairs are still\
  \ going to be important,</span> <span m='148000'>but they are going to be able to\
  \ be delocalized over the</span> <span m='151000'>entire molecule in some cases.</span>\
  \ <span m='160000'>So, this is very different. This is a major difference</span>\
  \ <span m='163000'>between MO theory and valance bond theory.</span> <span m='165000'>In\
  \ the case of the BH three molecule that we</span> <span m='169000'>considered last\
  \ time, you had four positively charged</span> <span m='172000'>nuclei. And you\
  \ arrange those four plus</span> <span m='174000'>charges at the points in space\
  \ that correspond to the</span> <span m='177000'>equilibrium geometry of the molecule.</span>\
  \ <span m='181000'>And then you sprinkle in your six valance electrons,</span> <span\
  \ m='185000'>and you want to understand how those six electrons become</span> <span\
  \ m='189000'>organized in space in response to that electric field set up by</span>\
  \ <span m='195000'>those four positively charged nuclei.</span> <span m='198000'>And\
  \ we took the approach last time that we are going to</span> <span m='202000'>localize\
  \ electron pairs in between nuclei.</span> <span m='207000'>And, because structurally\
  \ the BH three molecule is</span> <span m='210000'>symmetric and the three hydrogens\
  \ are indistinguishable</span> <span m='213000'>from one another, we decided that\
  \ we were going</span> <span m='216000'>to make hybrids. And so we talk about</span>\
  \ <span m='218000'>hybridization.</span> <span m='227000'>The idea behind hybridization\
  \ was to change the atomic</span> <span m='231000'>orbitals of boron by mixing them,\
  \ so that we would have one</span> <span m='235000'>that would be able to point\
  \ at each of the three hydrogens in</span> <span m='240000'>space to form three\
  \ nicely, perfectly directed electron</span> <span m='244000'>sigma bonds between\
  \ boron and hydrogen.</span> <span m='248000'>That was the scheme that we adopted,\
  \ this hybridization</span> <span m='251000'>scheme, but in MO theory we are not\
  \ going to do that.</span> <span m='254000'>We are not going to interfere with the\
  \ intrinsic atomic</span> <span m='257000'>orbital structure of a boron atom in\
  \ order to make bonds.</span> <span m='260000'>And we are going to see that there\
  \ are some predictions that</span> <span m='264000'>come out of the MO treatment\
  \ for the molecule that differ from</span> <span m='267000'>those that came out\
  \ of the valance bond treatment for the</span> <span m='271000'>molecule. And so\
  \ here,</span> <span m='272000'>no hybrids.</span> <span m='279000'>In terms of\
  \ just the vernacular of chemical structure,</span> <span m='283000'>you will hear\
  \ sp three as being used interchangeably</span> <span m='289000'>with the notion\
  \ of a tetrahedron.</span> <span m='292000'>But in valance bond theory, it refers\
  \ to a particular</span> <span m='297000'>hybridization scheme in which we actually\
  \ mix s and p as a</span> <span m='302000'>preparative to bond formation in a molecule.</span>\
  \ <span m='308000'>And we mix the atomic orbitals on that central atom in a</span>\
  \ <span m='311000'>hybridization scheme. In MO theory,</span> <span m='314000'>we\
  \ are not going to do that. It is very important that you</span> <span m='318000'>keep\
  \ these theories and the language associated with the</span> <span m='322000'>theories\
  \ separate in your minds so you can see the difference</span> <span m='326000'>between\
  \ these theories. And then one of the</span> <span m='329000'>consequences of this\
  \ valance bond theory and the</span> <span m='333000'>hybridization scheme is that\
  \ it is not so good for excited</span> <span m='337000'>states.</span> <span m='347000'>And\
  \ what that means is that we were developing a scheme to</span> <span m='350000'>describe\
  \ the bonding in the molecule in its ground</span> <span m='353000'>electronic state.\
  \ Molecules can have excited</span> <span m='356000'>states, just like atoms can\
  \ have electronic states.</span> <span m='360000'>And over here, in molecular orbital\
  \ theory,</span> <span m='363000'>we are going to find that we do a much better\
  \ job with excited</span> <span m='368000'>states. And that is important for</span>\
  \ <span m='370000'>understanding the range of properties associated with</span>\
  \ <span m='375000'>molecular systems. And you are going to see,</span> <span m='378000'>indeed,\
  \ that the energy level scheme for the six valance</span> <span m='383000'>electrons\
  \ in the BH three molecule is different,</span> <span m='387000'>depending on whether\
  \ you use valence bond theory or molecular</span> <span m='392000'>orbital theory.\
  \ Now, for molecular orbital</span> <span m='397000'>theory, we are going to need,\
  \ again, like we do for valance</span> <span m='401000'>bonds, to have some kind\
  \ of a procedure for forming molecular</span> <span m='406000'>orbitals, conceptually.</span>\
  \ <span m='440000'>And the first step in such a procedure is that you are going</span>\
  \ <span m='444000'>to want to analyze the three-dimensional shape of the</span>\
  \ <span m='447000'>molecule. And we do this,</span> <span m='449000'>of course,\
  \ when we talk about the valance-shell electron-pair</span> <span m='453000'>repulsion\
  \ theory for predicting molecular structure.</span> <span m='458000'>We are going\
  \ to look at the structure.</span> <span m='463000'>And we want to identify, usually\
  \ by inspection,</span> <span m='470000'>sets of symmetry-related --</span> <span\
  \ m='482000'>-- atoms or orbitals. And here, I am talking about</span> <span m='486000'>atomic\
  \ orbitals. I will come back in a moment</span> <span m='491000'>and talk about\
  \ what I mean by symmetry-related.</span> <span m='495000'>This is a concept that\
  \ can be put on a very nice,</span> <span m='500000'>firm, mathematical footing.\
  \ And, in fact,</span> <span m='505000'>if you find this type of analysis interesting\
  \ and would</span> <span m='509000'>like to see more of the math that can help you\
  \ to organize</span> <span m='514000'>the results of quantum mechanics in terms\
  \ of symmetry,</span> <span m='518000'>then you will want to put the 5.04 subject\
  \ on your calendar</span> <span m='523000'>for the future. That subject is devoted,</span>\
  \ <span m='526000'>in large part, to the applications of group</span> <span m='530000'>theory\
  \ to chemistry and chemical problems.</span> <span m='533000'>And symmetry plays\
  \ a big role in that.</span> <span m='538000'>And then, two, we are going to form</span>\
  \ <span m='542000'>combinations. And let me just further</span> <span m='547000'>quantify\
  \ this by saying we are going to form linear</span> <span m='554000'>combinations\
  \ --</span> <span m='564000'>-- of symmetry-related orbitals.</span> <span m='585000'>One\
  \ of the big approximations that we usually kind of take for</span> <span m='590000'>granted\
  \ in the molecular orbital theory of electronic structure</span> <span m='597000'>is\
  \ the LCAO approximation. I am just going to mention that</span> <span m='602000'>parenthetically,\
  \ here.</span> <span m='604000'>This is that we can form molecular orbitals that\
  \ will be</span> <span m='610000'>linear combinations of atomic orbitals.</span>\
  \ <span m='613000'>This LCAO approximation arises from the fact that we can solve</span>\
  \ <span m='619000'>the Schr\u02C6dinger equation exactly for the hydrogen atom,</span>\
  \ <span m='624000'>but for big molecules and many electrons systems,</span> <span\
  \ m='628000'>we cannot. And what we like to do is to</span> <span m='633000'>take\
  \ the atomic orbital wave functions, that is,</span> <span m='636000'>atomic orbital\
  \ here in LCAO, and use those wave functions in</span> <span m='641000'>our approximation\
  \ of molecular orbitals.</span> <span m='643000'>We are saying that we can combine\
  \ these atomic orbitals on</span> <span m='648000'>the atoms that are in a molecule\
  \ to form the molecular orbitals</span> <span m='652000'>that will be able to spread\
  \ out and delocalize over the entire</span> <span m='657000'>molecule. This is inherent\
  \ in the</span> <span m='661000'>development of the theory that I am working on\
  \ here.</span> <span m='667000'>And you should see that this will pop up in a number\
  \ of</span> <span m='673000'>cases, but it is an inherent approximation that we\
  \ are</span> <span m='679000'>accepting. And then, three,</span> <span m='681000'>we\
  \ are going to combine the linear combinations from part</span> <span m='688000'>two\
  \ --</span> <span m='698000'>-- with central atom atomic orbitals.</span> <span\
  \ m='702000'>And that is what we will do. And if we have done that</span> <span\
  \ m='709000'>properly, we will have arrived at molecular orbitals for the</span>\
  \ <span m='716000'>system in question. Now, I want to take a little</span> <span\
  \ m='721000'>bit of time to go through each one of these steps in order to</span>\
  \ <span m='726000'>define the problem that we have for this alternative way of</span>\
  \ <span m='730000'>viewing the electronic structure of the BH three molecule.</span>\
  \ <span m='734000'>Now, why am I choosing the BH</span> <span m='736000'>three molecule\
  \ for this? Well, I am choosing it because</span> <span m='741000'>it is an easy\
  \ problem and one that is illustrative of the</span> <span m='744000'>steps that\
  \ go into forming molecular orbitals for a system.</span> <span m='750000'>In your\
  \ textbook, you will see that before you</span> <span m='754000'>get to something\
  \ like BH three, first diatomic</span> <span m='760000'>molecules are considered.\
  \ Those, I will show you on</span> <span m='766000'>Friday, are actually a little\
  \ trickier to understand than is</span> <span m='772000'>the case with BH three.\
  \ That is because in molecular</span> <span m='779000'>orbital theory we have the\
  \ same number of MOs as AOs.</span> <span m='791000'>If we start out with a certain\
  \ number of atomic orbitals that</span> <span m='795000'>come into play by virtue\
  \ of the atoms that are in the molecule,</span> <span m='799000'>then that number\
  \ of orbitals will be the same as the number</span> <span m='803000'>of molecular\
  \ orbitals that we will get at the end of the</span> <span m='807000'>problem. They\
  \ won't all be filled.</span> <span m='810000'>We will have some that are empty.</span>\
  \ <span m='812000'>But we are going to have the same number of molecular</span>\
  \ <span m='815000'>orbitals as atomic orbitals that go into the problem.</span>\
  \ <span m='819000'>And so what that means is that the complexity of the problem\
  \ is</span> <span m='823000'>related to the number of MOs and, hence, the number\
  \ of AOs.</span> <span m='833000'>The complexity of the problem scales with the\
  \ number of atomic</span> <span m='839000'>orbitals in the problem. We actually\
  \ call these our</span> <span m='843000'>basis functions. And one of the things\
  \ that John</span> <span m='846000'>Pople talks about, if you have gone and looked\
  \ at</span> <span m='850000'>his video that I pointed you to in the problem set,</span>\
  \ <span m='853000'>he talks about the wonderful fact that our computational</span>\
  \ <span m='857000'>power has gotten so great, and will grow so much greater</span>\
  \ <span m='861000'>in the future, that we are able to</span> <span m='863000'>computationally\
  \ handle problems of the calculations of the</span> <span m='867000'>properties\
  \ of enormous molecules that bring into a problem an</span> <span m='871000'>enormous\
  \ number, a vast number of atomic</span> <span m='874000'>orbitals. And so, a great\
  \ computational</span> <span m='878000'>power is necessary to apply molecular orbital\
  \ theory,</span> <span m='882000'>or even the more recent density functional theory,</span>\
  \ <span m='886000'>to problems of electronic structure that we need to</span> <span\
  \ m='891000'>grapple with in order to predict properties of molecular systems.</span>\
  \ <span m='896000'>And in the BH three molecule, which is,</span> <span m='900000'>as\
  \ I said, a simple problem of electronic structure and a nice</span> <span m='905000'>illustrative\
  \ one for today's purposes, we have,</span> <span m='909000'>this is a seven orbital\
  \ problem.</span> <span m='923000'>Why is this a seven orbital problem?</span> <span\
  \ m='925000'>It is a seven orbital problem because boron has four valance</span>\
  \ <span m='930000'>orbitals, an s, a px, a py, a pz.</span> <span m='934000'>And\
  \ we have three hydrogens, each with their 1s orbital.</span> <span m='938000'>We\
  \ have our valance orbitals on boron.</span> <span m='941000'>We don't count the\
  \ 1s orbital on boron because that is filled</span> <span m='946000'>and is a core\
  \ orbital, and it doesn't get involved in</span> <span m='951000'>chemical bonding.\
  \ The valance shell for boron is</span> <span m='955000'>the n equals two shell.\
  \ We have 2s, 2px,</span> <span m='959000'>2py and 2pz. And we have three hydrogens,</span>\
  \ <span m='963000'>each with their 1s orbital. If we were to tackle right now</span>\
  \ <span m='969000'>the problem of the molecular orbital energy level diagram for</span>\
  \ <span m='975000'>a diatomic molecule like O two, dioxygen,</span> <span m='980000'>we\
  \ would find immediately that this analysis of how many atomic</span> <span m='987000'>orbitals\
  \ we have available would give us the value eight.</span> <span m='994000'>And so\
  \ it is a more complicated problem.</span> <span m='997000'>It has one more atomic\
  \ orbital than this problem,</span> <span m='1001000'>even though this one has four\
  \ atoms because three of these</span> <span m='1005000'>atoms happen to be hydrogens,\
  \ which only bring in one orbital</span> <span m='1010000'>to the problem. That\
  \ is why I am choosing this.</span> <span m='1014000'>And then, in addition, I am\
  \ choosing this because the</span> <span m='1018000'>consequences of the symmetry\
  \ of the BH three molecule</span> <span m='1023000'>are that the orbital interactions\
  \ that we are going</span> <span m='1027000'>to identify occur in nice pair-wise\
  \ sets.</span> <span m='1032000'>And that makes things especially easy to see in\
  \ terms</span> <span m='1036000'>of how chemical bonds arise in the context of MO\
  \ theory for a</span> <span m='1041000'>problem like this. And so, to now go ahead\
  \ and</span> <span m='1045000'>carry out step one for this, we are going to draw\
  \ the</span> <span m='1050000'>molecule and try to identify sets of symmetry-related</span>\
  \ <span m='1054000'>atoms/orbitals. And, before you do that,</span> <span m='1059000'>I\
  \ just would like to show you an example of a highly symmetric</span> <span m='1064000'>molecule,\
  \ because this notion of symmetry is something that,</span> <span m='1069000'>at\
  \ this point in time, I really only want you to gain</span> <span m='1074000'>an\
  \ intuitive grasp of, I am not going to quantify it.</span> <span m='1080000'>But,\
  \ if you look at a molecule like the one I have placed on</span> <span m='1086000'>the\
  \ left and right-hand screens, you will see that it is a</span> <span m='1093000'>large,\
  \ round molecule. Actually, round,</span> <span m='1098000'>spherical things are\
  \ the most symmetric things that we can</span> <span m='1104000'>think of. Here,\
  \ you can imagine that this</span> <span m='1109000'>is a big ball with atoms located\
  \ at various points on the surface</span> <span m='1115000'>of the ball. This is\
  \ just a ball and stick</span> <span m='1119000'>representation of the C60 molecule,\
  \ also known as</span> <span m='1123000'>Buckminsterfullerene. It is a geodesic\
  \ dome-type of</span> <span m='1128000'>molecule. This molecule has the chemical</span>\
  \ <span m='1131000'>formula C60. There are no hydrogens in this</span> <span m='1135000'>molecule.\
  \ All the atoms are displayed.</span> <span m='1140000'>And each carbon atom sits\
  \ in a position where it is adjacent to</span> <span m='1144000'>one five-membered\
  \ ring and two six-membered rings on the</span> <span m='1147000'>surface of this\
  \ spherical molecule.</span> <span m='1150000'>And that is true of every carbon\
  \ atom on the surface of</span> <span m='1153000'>this whole molecule. As you go\
  \ on in chemistry,</span> <span m='1157000'>if you go into the analysis of molecules\
  \ using nuclear magnetic</span> <span m='1161000'>resonance spectroscopy, you will\
  \ find that it is really</span> <span m='1164000'>important to be able to identify\
  \ the symmetry of a molecule.</span> <span m='1170000'>And you will realize that\
  \ the symmetry of the molecule is</span> <span m='1174000'>manifest in the nuclear\
  \ magnetic resonance spectrum of a</span> <span m='1178000'>molecule. If you take\
  \ the carbon-13</span> <span m='1181000'>nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of\
  \ this molecule,</span> <span m='1185000'>a sample composed of this molecule, you\
  \ will see that</span> <span m='1189000'>there is only a single C13 signal in the\
  \ spectrum.</span> <span m='1193000'>And that is because all 60 carbon atoms are\
  \ in an identical</span> <span m='1197000'>environment in this molecule. Every one\
  \ of them feels exactly</span> <span m='1203000'>like everyone else. They are all\
  \ equidistant from</span> <span m='1207000'>the center of this molecule. And they\
  \ are all equidistant</span> <span m='1211000'>from their set of neighbors. And\
  \ so, in that way of looking</span> <span m='1216000'>at a molecule, you would see\
  \ that they are all</span> <span m='1220000'>equivalent. You may have encountered\
  \ this</span> <span m='1223000'>molecule before, but this molecule's discovery</span>\
  \ <span m='1226000'>-- -- was actually predicted</span> <span m='1230000'>initially\
  \ from analysis of mass spectrometry data by Professor</span> <span m='1234000'>Smalley,\
  \ a Nobel Prize winner whose efforts in this area have</span> <span m='1239000'>spawned\
  \ off chemistries involving not only these</span> <span m='1243000'>nano-sized balls\
  \ of matter, but also nanotubes made of</span> <span m='1247000'>carbon, and this\
  \ whole area that we think of nano technology.</span> <span m='1252000'>Really a\
  \ lot of it is dominated by the chemistry of new forms of</span> <span m='1257000'>carbon\
  \ that arose with the discovery of</span> <span m='1261000'>Buckminsterfullerene.\
  \ And that is just one example of</span> <span m='1266000'>a new allotrope of carbon\
  \ that was discovered in recent years.</span> <span m='1272000'>This gives you an\
  \ idea for symmetry.</span> <span m='1275000'>I could show you pictures, actually,\
  \ of enormous</span> <span m='1279000'>biomolecules. There are large viruses that</span>\
  \ <span m='1283000'>are composed of biopolymers, macromolecules that pack in a</span>\
  \ <span m='1288000'>way that is symmetrical, so that you can see these</span> <span\
  \ m='1293000'>things. If you view them in the right</span> <span m='1297000'>kind\
  \ of representation, you will be able to see the</span> <span m='1300000'>symmetry\
  \ in them. And one definition of symmetry</span> <span m='1304000'>that I would\
  \ like you to take away from this picture is just</span> <span m='1308000'>that\
  \ each of the atoms that are symmetry-related is</span> <span m='1311000'>indistinguishable.\
  \ If you turn the molecule around</span> <span m='1315000'>and look at the atoms,\
  \ those that are symmetry-related</span> <span m='1319000'>are indistinguishable\
  \ from one another.</span> <span m='1323000'>And so, when we have a trigonal planer\
  \ BH three</span> <span m='1327000'>molecule, is the boron symmetry related to any\
  \ of the other</span> <span m='1331000'>atoms? No, it is not.</span> <span m='1333000'>What\
  \ about this hydrogen? I labeled them last time A,</span> <span m='1337000'>B, and\
  \ C. This hydrogen labeled C,</span> <span m='1340000'>is it symmetry-related to\
  \ other hydrogens?</span> <span m='1343000'>Yes. And that is because of the</span>\
  \ <span m='1345000'>symmetry of this molecule with these 120 degree bond angles\
  \ on</span> <span m='1350000'>the planarity of the molecule. So, you have a set\
  \ of three</span> <span m='1356000'>hydrogens. And their 1s orbitals are in</span>\
  \ <span m='1359000'>space indistinguishable from one another.</span> <span m='1362000'>They\
  \ are related by symmetry. And so, in this problem here,</span> <span m='1367000'>we\
  \ have four orbitals here on the boron that are not</span> <span m='1371000'>symmetry-related.\
  \ And then also incidentally let</span> <span m='1375000'>me point out that the\
  \ boron atom is located at the center of</span> <span m='1380000'>gravity of this\
  \ system. If atoms are going to be</span> <span m='1384000'>symmetry-related, they\
  \ must not be located at the</span> <span m='1388000'>center of gravity of the system.\
  \ Let's go over here and expand</span> <span m='1393000'>on these ideas.</span>\
  \ <span m='1415000'>The method that I am going to develop here for forming the</span>\
  \ <span m='1419000'>linear combinations has to do with thinking ahead,</span> <span\
  \ m='1424000'>in this problem, to the fact that we are going</span> <span m='1428000'>to\
  \ want to make linear combinations that have the</span> <span m='1432000'>correct\
  \ symmetry to bond to atomic orbitals on the central</span> <span m='1437000'>boron\
  \ atom. Let me draw the ones that are</span> <span m='1440000'>going to be relevant\
  \ to this part of the problem.</span> <span m='1464000'>This one over here would\
  \ be the boron pz orbital,</span> <span m='1468000'>so it has one positive lobe\
  \ coming out of the board,</span> <span m='1473000'>negative lobe going back. Over\
  \ here we would have the</span> <span m='1477000'>boron py orbital using the coordinate\
  \ system that I had</span> <span m='1482000'>chosen last time, which is x up and\
  \ y to the</span> <span m='1486000'>left. And then here we have the</span> <span\
  \ m='1489000'>boron's px orbital. And then over here we have the</span> <span m='1493000'>boron's\
  \ 2s orbital. And so, our challenge now will</span> <span m='1499000'>be to construct\
  \ linear combinations,</span> <span m='1502000'>we are at part two, of the set of\
  \ three hydrogen 1s</span> <span m='1506000'>orbitals that can match in symmetry\
  \ the boron central</span> <span m='1510000'>atom's atomic orbitals. Last time,\
  \ remember,</span> <span m='1513000'>for hybridization, we were making these orbitals</span>\
  \ <span m='1517000'>mix with each other in order to point at the hydrogens.</span>\
  \ <span m='1521000'>Now what we are doing is kind of an inverse concept.</span>\
  \ <span m='1527000'>We are going to mix the hydrogen orbitals so that they</span>\
  \ <span m='1530000'>have the right symmetry to interact with the central atom</span>\
  \ <span m='1534000'>atomic orbitals. There is a nice parallelism</span> <span m='1537000'>here.\
  \ Here is going to be our LCs.</span> <span m='1550000'>They key feature of the\
  \ boron's 2s orbital is that it does not</span> <span m='1553000'>have any nodes.\
  \ Remember nodes are surfaces.</span> <span m='1556000'>When you pass from one side\
  \ of a node to the other,</span> <span m='1559000'>you get a change in sign of the\
  \ wave function.</span> <span m='1563000'>And we indicate that change in sign by\
  \ differential shading.</span> <span m='1568000'>The 2s orbital has no nodes whatsoever.</span>\
  \ <span m='1571000'>And a way that we can construct a linear combination that has</span>\
  \ <span m='1576000'>the same spatial, nodal properties as that boron</span> <span\
  \ m='1580000'>2s atomic orbital is as follows. We can involve contributions</span>\
  \ <span m='1585000'>from each of the three hydrogen 1s orbitals.</span> <span m='1590000'>Remember\
  \ this one is A, this one is B,</span> <span m='1593000'>and this one is C. This\
  \ is going to be a linear</span> <span m='1597000'>combination of the three hydrogen\
  \ 1s orbitals.</span> <span m='1600000'>I will write this one as follows.</span>\
  \ <span m='1603000'>This one will be written as A plus B plus C.</span> <span m='1607000'>That\
  \ indicates the 1s orbital on A, plus the 1s orbital on B,</span> <span m='1612000'>plus\
  \ the 1s orbital on C. And, as we talked about last</span> <span m='1617000'>time,\
  \ wave functions that we write should be normalized.</span> <span m='1623000'>And\
  \ they should satisfy the unit orbital contribution rule.</span> <span m='1627000'>For\
  \ normalization, here, I give a factor of one</span> <span m='1630000'>over root\
  \ three for this linear combination formed as a symmetry</span> <span m='1635000'>match\
  \ with the boron 2s orbital. You can see,</span> <span m='1638000'>I hope, what\
  \ we are doing. We are projecting the nodal</span> <span m='1642000'>properties\
  \ of the central atom atomic orbitals onto the linear</span> <span m='1647000'>combinations\
  \ that we are forming.</span> <span m='1651000'>And we are going to form a complete\
  \ set of three linear</span> <span m='1656000'>combinations in this way. Let's make\
  \ one that has</span> <span m='1660000'>symmetry properties that remind us of this\
  \ px orbital.</span> <span m='1665000'>On HA we are going to have a positive contribution\
  \ to match</span> <span m='1670000'>the positive contribution of this lobe of the\
  \ px orbital that</span> <span m='1676000'>points along the plus x axis. And then\
  \ down here we are going</span> <span m='1682000'>to have contributions from hydrogens\
  \ B and C.</span> <span m='1685000'>And they are going to be smaller, and they are\
  \ going to</span> <span m='1689000'>be opposite in-phase. They are going to be opposite</span>\
  \ <span m='1693000'>in-phase because we are building a linear combination that has\
  \ a</span> <span m='1697000'>node approximately at the center of the system here,</span>\
  \ <span m='1701000'>so as you go from positive x into the negative x region of</span>\
  \ <span m='1705000'>space, the wave function changes sign to match the change in\
  \ sign</span> <span m='1710000'>associated with the px orbital. We are projecting\
  \ the nodal</span> <span m='1716000'>properties of px onto the linear combination\
  \ of hydrogen orbitals</span> <span m='1720000'>that we are forming here. And this\
  \ one,</span> <span m='1723000'>written in normalized fashion, will be root two\
  \ over three,</span> <span m='1728000'>A minus one-half B minus one-half C.</span>\
  \ <span m='1730000'>And, although what we are</span> <span m='1735000'>working with\
  \ here are linear combinations of these</span> <span m='1738000'>symmetry-related\
  \ hydrogen 1s wave functions,</span> <span m='1742000'>you are going to find that\
  \ these coefficients on the atomic</span> <span m='1746000'>orbitals, that contribute\
  \ eventually to the molecular</span> <span m='1750000'>orbitals, are going to come\
  \ out as normalized and as unit</span> <span m='1754000'>orbital contributions.\
  \ So that if we started out this</span> <span m='1760000'>problem with a single\
  \ 1s orbital on HA, that will be entirely</span> <span m='1764000'>accounted for\
  \ among these linear combinations and the molecular</span> <span m='1769000'>orbitals\
  \ that we are going to make with them.</span> <span m='1773000'>Now, let's generate\
  \ a linear combination having the nodal</span> <span m='1777000'>properties of py.\
  \ And, in order to do that,</span> <span m='1781000'>we need to have a negative\
  \ coefficient out here in the</span> <span m='1786000'>minus y direction. We are\
  \ going to put in a</span> <span m='1789000'>contribution from HC as negative, like\
  \ that,</span> <span m='1793000'>to match that. And then over here,</span> <span\
  \ m='1796000'>we are going to make a contribution for HB that is</span> <span m='1800000'>positive.\
  \ And then, noting that there is</span> <span m='1805000'>a nodal plane along the\
  \ y,z-plane, which comes out of</span> <span m='1808000'>the board like this, so\
  \ that we are always negative</span> <span m='1812000'>along minus y and we are\
  \ positive along plus y.</span> <span m='1815000'>We match that here. And the coincidence\
  \ of that</span> <span m='1819000'>nodal plane with the location of HA dictates\
  \ no contribution from</span> <span m='1823000'>HA to this orbital, for reasons\
  \ that actually we</span> <span m='1827000'>looked at last time, --</span> <span\
  \ m='1830000'>-- namely, that we cannot bring a hydrogen 1s orbital in here</span>\
  \ <span m='1835000'>and also change sign on going half-way through that hydrogen</span>\
  \ <span m='1841000'>1s orbital, because s orbitals have to have the same sign</span>\
  \ <span m='1846000'>everywhere. It does not contribute to this</span> <span m='1850000'>linear\
  \ combination. And our normalized form for</span> <span m='1854000'>this will be\
  \ one over root two B minus C.</span> <span m='1858000'>And then, if I were to ask\
  \ the</span> <span m='1864000'>question, can I make a linear combination of the\
  \ three</span> <span m='1867000'>hydrogen 1s orbitals that has the same nodal properties\
  \ as pz,</span> <span m='1871000'>the answer would be no because they all lie in\
  \ the x,y-plane</span> <span m='1875000'>and they are just s orbitals and cannot\
  \ change sign as you go</span> <span m='1880000'>through the x,y-plane from plus\
  \ z to minus z.</span> <span m='1883000'>And so, we are done here. And what you\
  \ are going to find</span> <span m='1886000'>is that we have created these three\
  \ linear combination</span> <span m='1890000'>according to step two. And taking\
  \ into account both</span> <span m='1895000'>the symmetry properties of the molecule\
  \ to identify a set of</span> <span m='1899000'>three symmetry-related atoms and\
  \ orbitals.</span> <span m='1902000'>And then, taking into account an analysis of\
  \ the nodal</span> <span m='1907000'>properties of the central atom atomic orbitals,</span>\
  \ <span m='1910000'>so that we could project those out to help us find appropriate</span>\
  \ <span m='1915000'>linear combinations for mixing with the central atom orbitals.</span>\
  \ <span m='1930000'>And, when we do that mixing, we are going to find out that</span>\
  \ <span m='1934000'>there are three ways that we can do it.</span> <span m='1937000'>We\
  \ are about to move onto step three of this problem.</span> <span m='1941000'>We\
  \ are going to need to combine these linear combinations with</span> <span m='1946000'>the\
  \ central atom atomic orbitals according to the rules of MO</span> <span m='1951000'>theory\
  \ to generate, first, bonding molecular</span> <span m='1955000'>orbitals.</span>\
  \ <span m='1963000'>And the bonding molecular orbitals that we will get will</span>\
  \ <span m='1970000'>be an in-phase combination --</span> <span m='1981000'>-- of\
  \ our LCs, our linear combinations of</span> <span m='1984000'>atomic orbitals,\
  \ with our boron atomic orbitals.</span> <span m='1989000'>That will describe the\
  \ chemical bonding in our system.</span> <span m='1994000'>And we will see that\
  \ it contrasts in a very interesting</span> <span m='1999000'>way with the hybridization\
  \ scheme developed last time.</span> <span m='2004000'>And the key phrase to underline,\
  \ here,</span> <span m='2007000'>is in-phase. And what that in-phase means is</span>\
  \ <span m='2012000'>that when two positive lobes of two orbitals centered on two</span>\
  \ <span m='2016000'>different atoms are juxtaposed and neighbor one another and\
  \ can</span> <span m='2020000'>have good overlap of their atomic orbital wave functions,</span>\
  \ <span m='2024000'>that leads to in-phase constructive interference and</span>\
  \ <span m='2028000'>stabilization of the electrons associated with that newly</span>\
  \ <span m='2032000'>formed bonding molecular orbital.</span> <span m='2034000'>And\
  \ that stabilization is what we call the chemical bond.</span> <span m='2040000'>The\
  \ analogy to that in valence bond theory is the idea that a</span> <span m='2044000'>pair\
  \ of electrons associated with two nuclei in a sigma bond</span> <span m='2048000'>is\
  \ more stable because it experiences, simultaneously,</span> <span m='2051000'>two\
  \ positive charges. And here we are generalizing</span> <span m='2055000'>that and\
  \ allowing electrons to flow over the molecule as a</span> <span m='2059000'>whole.\
  \ But now we have a new concept,</span> <span m='2061000'>and that is antibonding.</span>\
  \ <span m='2070000'>Antibonding molecular orbitals will be out-of-phase</span> <span\
  \ m='2076000'>combinations that are repulsive and lead to high energy</span> <span\
  \ m='2082000'>interactions.</span> <span m='2090000'>And when, as in the case of\
  \ the problem we are considering here,</span> <span m='2095000'>the interactions\
  \ occur in pair-wise sets,</span> <span m='2098000'>we will find that we get very\
  \ nicely, for every bonding</span> <span m='2103000'>molecular orbital, a corresponding\
  \ anti-bonding</span> <span m='2107000'>molecular orbital.</span> <span m='2115000'>Also,\
  \ one of the interesting things is that if you start</span> <span m='2118000'>putting\
  \ electrons into anti-bonding orbitals,</span> <span m='2120000'>if your system\
  \ just happens to be so constructed as to have</span> <span m='2123000'>many electrons,\
  \ such that you fill up not only</span> <span m='2126000'>the bonding molecular\
  \ orbitals of electrons to make the</span> <span m='2129000'>chemical bonds, but\
  \ you continue on and you</span> <span m='2131000'>have enough electrons to keep\
  \ going and put them into</span> <span m='2134000'>anti-bonding orbitals, those\
  \ antibonds start to cancel</span> <span m='2137000'>the bonds. And so, you will\
  \ see a very</span> <span m='2140000'>nice progression of this as we study the MO\
  \ theory of the</span> <span m='2144000'>homonuclear diatomic molecules, starting\
  \ on Friday.</span> <span m='2148000'>And then, here is another concept that arises\
  \ from the MO</span> <span m='2152000'>analysis of a molecule, and that is that\
  \ certain</span> <span m='2155000'>orbitals can be non-bonding.</span> <span m='2164000'>And\
  \ an example of this would be a lone pair of electrons.</span> <span m='2170000'>And\
  \ it happens when an orbital or a linear combination of</span> <span m='2176000'>orbitals\
  \ finds no counterpart --</span> <span m='2187000'>-- of like nodal symmetry. These\
  \ nodal properties of</span> <span m='2191000'>orbitals are very important, and\
  \ I will show you later how</span> <span m='2196000'>the nodal properties are related\
  \ to the energies of the orbitals,</span> <span m='2202000'>as we consider them.\
  \ Having given you this preview</span> <span m='2206000'>of how orbitals are going\
  \ to be able to combine in the MO</span> <span m='2212000'>theory, let's see how\
  \ it actually takes place in the case</span> <span m='2217000'>of BH three.</span>\
  \ <span m='2235000'>Now we are drawing another example of an energy-level</span>\
  \ <span m='2238000'>diagram, where the energy is low at the bottom and rises as\
  \ it</span> <span m='2243000'>goes up. And these energy-level diagrams</span> <span\
  \ m='2246000'>that we are now developing for molecules are analogous to those</span>\
  \ <span m='2250000'>that you studied earlier in the semester for atoms.</span> <span\
  \ m='2255000'>And we are just generalizing this notion to the atoms.</span> <span\
  \ m='2261000'>And what I am drawing over here is our boron 2s orbital and here</span>\
  \ <span m='2268000'>is our boron 2px, 2py, 2pz orbital.</span> <span m='2272000'>Those\
  \ horizontal bars just represent the energy of these</span> <span m='2278000'>orbitals\
  \ in the molecule. Here I am just redrawing the</span> <span m='2284000'>boron atom.\
  \ And then, over here on the</span> <span m='2288000'>right, we are going to see\
  \ that we have our linear combinations</span> <span m='2294000'>that we developed.\
  \ These are our three H 1s linear</span> <span m='2299000'>combinations. We found\
  \ that the three</span> <span m='2302000'>hydrogens in BH three were symmetry equivalent,</span>\
  \ <span m='2308000'>so we generated linear combinations.</span> <span m='2313000'>The\
  \ pictures of them are over there.</span> <span m='2318000'>I can give them names.\
  \ Why don't I call them D,</span> <span m='2325000'>E, and F.</span> <span m='2340000'>We\
  \ have D constructed to match the nodal properties of the</span> <span m='2345000'>boron's\
  \ 2s orbital. E and F were respectively</span> <span m='2349000'>constructed to\
  \ match the nodal properties of the boron's 2s,</span> <span m='2354000'>2px, and\
  \ 2py orbitals. And I am showing you their</span> <span m='2358000'>relative energies.\
  \ And now we need to do this</span> <span m='2362000'>issue referenced here as point\
  \ three.</span> <span m='2366000'>We need to combine these things.</span> <span\
  \ m='2370000'>I have these on the one hand and these on the other.</span> <span\
  \ m='2373000'>Our seven atomic orbitals have been changed into four atomic</span>\
  \ <span m='2378000'>orbitals and three linear combinations,</span> <span m='2380000'>so\
  \ I still have seven orbitals total.</span> <span m='2383000'>And now I am going\
  \ to combine these with these according to</span> <span m='2387000'>their nodal\
  \ properties to generate seven molecular</span> <span m='2391000'>orbitals. And\
  \ let's do it this way.</span> <span m='2403000'>We are going to take linear combination\
  \ D that has been</span> <span m='2408000'>constructed to match the boron 2s orbital\
  \ in terms of nodal</span> <span m='2413000'>symmetry properties, and we are going\
  \ to make a</span> <span m='2418000'>bonding combination. I am going to draw these</span>\
  \ <span m='2422000'>pictorially in a moment. And, in this case,</span> <span m='2426000'>those\
  \ are the only two orbitals in my seven orbital system here</span> <span m='2432000'>that\
  \ have that set of nodal symmetry properties.</span> <span m='2438000'>And for every\
  \ bonding MO, I must have an antibonding MO.</span> <span m='2442000'>This is one\
  \ of our molecular orbitals.</span> <span m='2444000'>And there is going to be a\
  \ corresponding molecular orbital</span> <span m='2449000'>up here, high in energy.\
  \ And this will be an antibonding</span> <span m='2453000'>molecular orbital that\
  \ will be the out-of-phase combination of</span> <span m='2457000'>the boron 2s\
  \ with this linear combination that I labeled D.</span> <span m='2463000'>Antibonding\
  \ molecular orbitals are usually denoted with a star.</span> <span m='2469000'>We\
  \ have a bonding combination and an anti-bonding combination.</span> <span m='2475000'>Now,\
  \ we can form two more bonds that will spread out over the</span> <span m='2481000'>molecule\
  \ because, if you recall,</span> <span m='2484000'>we had our px and py pair that\
  \ served as the nodal template for</span> <span m='2491000'>our construction of\
  \ linear combinations E and F.</span> <span m='2497000'>We are going to be able\
  \ to match up those to form two more</span> <span m='2502000'>bonding molecular\
  \ orbitals. And these will be found to be</span> <span m='2508000'>higher in energy\
  \ than the first one that we formed from D.</span> <span m='2513000'>Here is a pair\
  \ of bonding molecular orbitals that derive</span> <span m='2519000'>from linear\
  \ combinations E and F combining in-phase with boron's</span> <span m='2525000'>px\
  \ and py atomic orbitals. And there will be a</span> <span m='2530000'>corresponding\
  \ antibonding combination, where we allow</span> <span m='2534000'>those orbitals\
  \ to interact in an out-of-phase manner.</span> <span m='2539000'>And you will see\
  \ what that means shortly.</span> <span m='2542000'>Let me put that up there and\
  \ add a star to indicate that this</span> <span m='2547000'>high energy pair of\
  \ molecular orbitals is an antibonding pair</span> <span m='2552000'>of orbitals.\
  \ I have six orbitals now in my</span> <span m='2556000'>molecular orbital energy-level\
  \ diagram for BH three.</span> <span m='2560000'>And that means I am not done because\
  \ I have to have seven,</span> <span m='2564000'>and I started out with seven atomic\
  \ orbitals.</span> <span m='2567000'>Look over here. 2pz was an atomic orbital on</span>\
  \ <span m='2570000'>boron that did not find any way of serving as a template for</span>\
  \ <span m='2575000'>making a linear combination involving the three hydrogens.</span>\
  \ <span m='2580000'>And so, it comes over here as nonbonding.</span> <span m='2585000'>It\
  \ has no counterpart of like nodal symmetry because of the</span> <span m='2592000'>location\
  \ of those three hydrogens in the x,y-plane,</span> <span m='2598000'>which is a\
  \ nodal plane for the boron pz orbital.</span> <span m='2605000'>And so, this one\
  \ is nonbonding. These three orbitals up here</span> <span m='2612000'>are anti-bonding.\
  \ And the ones down at the</span> <span m='2615000'>bottom, which are the lowest\
  \ in energy, corresponding to being</span> <span m='2620000'>able to most tightly\
  \ hold onto electrons in them are bonding</span> <span m='2625000'>molecular orbitals.\
  \ And so our electrons can fill</span> <span m='2629000'>into this MO energy-level\
  \ diagram in that way.</span> <span m='2633000'>We have our six electrons that come\
  \ into this problem.</span> <span m='2639000'>We have boron bringing in three valance\
  \ electrons and three</span> <span m='2643000'>hydrogens each bringing in one valance\
  \ electron.</span> <span m='2647000'>There are six electrons to put into the diagram,</span>\
  \ <span m='2650000'>filling up three of the molecular orbitals and then</span> <span\
  \ m='2654000'>leaving empty pz. Let me introduce a little bit</span> <span m='2658000'>more\
  \ MO language right now. This one here will be called</span> <span m='2662000'>the\
  \ highest occupied molecular orbital, and this one here will</span> <span m='2667000'>be\
  \ called the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.</span> <span m='2672000'>The reason\
  \ why I am drawing attention to these orbitals is</span> <span m='2677000'>that\
  \ in chemistry, the chemical properties derive</span> <span m='2681000'>oftentimes\
  \ from those orbitals that are in what is called the</span> <span m='2687000'>frontier\
  \ orbital region. And the frontier orbitals are</span> <span m='2692000'>those close\
  \ in energy to the HOMO-LUMO gap.</span> <span m='2696000'>And I will come back\
  \ to this. But those highest energetically</span> <span m='2702000'>lying electrons\
  \ are going to be the ones responsible for</span> <span m='2705000'>nucleophilic\
  \ properties of the molecule and basic properties of</span> <span m='2710000'>the\
  \ molecule and reducing properties of the molecule.</span> <span m='2713000'>Whereas,\
  \ low-lying empty orbitals are going to be the</span> <span m='2717000'>ones responsible\
  \ for acidic properties of the molecule or</span> <span m='2720000'>oxidizing properties\
  \ of the molecule.</span> <span m='2723000'>And we will come back to that in a moment.</span>\
  \ <span m='2727000'>But that is something pretty general and very useful that</span>\
  \ <span m='2731000'>comes out of studying molecular orbital energy-level diagrams.</span>\
  \ <span m='2741000'>Now that we have the diagram, let's see what the orbitals in</span>\
  \ <span m='2746000'>the diagram look like. And I will try to do this</span> <span\
  \ m='2750000'>relatively quickly. Here, let's start with the</span> <span m='2754000'>lowest\
  \ lying molecular orbital in the system.</span> <span m='2759000'>This is a representation\
  \ of an in-phase combination of the</span> <span m='2764000'>boron 2s plus D, where\
  \ D is defined up here as</span> <span m='2769000'>that linear combination. This\
  \ will be a molecular</span> <span m='2774000'>orbital having the nodal properties\
  \ of a 2s orbital</span> <span m='2779000'>centered on that central atom. That is\
  \ where our lowest-lying</span> <span m='2785000'>two electrons reside. Now, if\
  \ you look at the LUMO</span> <span m='2791000'>over there and then go up one orbital\
  \ in energy,</span> <span m='2795000'>you will be looking at this orbital, which\
  \ is the boron 2s</span> <span m='2801000'>orbital minus D.</span> <span m='2808000'>And\
  \ the thing that makes this out-of-phase linear combination</span> <span m='2814000'>so\
  \ much higher in energy than its in-phase counterpart is the</span> <span m='2821000'>appearance,\
  \ now, of a nodal surface.</span> <span m='2826000'>And this node is between the\
  \ nuclei.</span> <span m='2828000'>It goes all the way around and is between the\
  \ central atom s</span> <span m='2833000'>orbital and those peripheral hydrogens.</span>\
  \ <span m='2836000'>And I will show you a picture of it.</span> <span m='2857000'>This\
  \ is our BH three LUMO plus one molecular orbital.</span> <span m='2872000'>You\
  \ can see that we have a wave function in the center of one</span> <span m='2876000'>sign.\
  \ And then, as we go along any</span> <span m='2878000'>one of the B-H bond vectors\
  \ from boron to hydrogen,</span> <span m='2882000'>we change phase midway along\
  \ the bond from positive to</span> <span m='2886000'>negative. And that is true,</span>\
  \ <span m='2889000'>no matter which of the three B-H bonds we pick to traverse</span>\
  \ <span m='2894000'>along. That one has the nodal</span> <span m='2897000'>properties\
  \ as drawn down there for the boron 2s interacting in</span> <span m='2902000'>an\
  \ out-of-phase manner with linear combination letter D.</span> <span m='2908000'>And\
  \ so, next time, I will finish up and show you</span> <span m='2912000'>what these\
  \ other orbitals look like as calculated.</span> <span m='2916000'>I hope you have\
  \ enjoyed this. We will see more MO theory on</span> <span m='2921751'>Friday.</span>\
