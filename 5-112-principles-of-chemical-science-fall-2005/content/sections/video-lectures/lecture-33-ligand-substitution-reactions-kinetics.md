  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>-- dissolved in water,
  such that there are six water</span> <span m='18000'>molecules arranged around the
  metal in an octahedral array.</span> </p><p><span m='22000'>You will see here that
  I have colored one of the water</span> <span m='26000'>molecule's oxygens in this
  peach color because we are going to</span> <span m='30000'>talk about reactions
  today. In fact, I am going to</span> <span m='34000'>introduce you to the idea of
  a potential energy surface for a</span> <span m='38000'>reaction. I am taking water
  substitution</span> <span m='41000'>as an example and as a context for this, but
  this very general.</span> </p><p><span m='46000'>And the same ideas that we are
  going to be talking about today</span> <span m='50000'>would apply to reactions
  in organic chemistry or in</span> <span m='54000'>biochemistry. Let's imagine having
  this</span> <span m='56000'>system dissolved in liquid water.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60000'>And let's further imagine that we have some way,</span> <span m='64000'>perhaps,
  for isotopic labeling of the oxygens in the water to</span> <span m='69000'>differentiate
  from those that start out on the metal complex.</span> </p><p><span m='74000'>And
  so I am differentiating here by using a green color for</span> <span m='79000'>the
  oxygen in a liquid water solvent.</span> </p><p><span m='83000'>And in this reaction,
  it is a very simple reaction in</span> <span m='87000'>which liquid water from solution,
  --</span> <span m='92000'>-- we are going to talk about reaction mechanisms today,</span>
  <span m='96000'>somehow will come in and bind to the metal center and displace</span>
  <span m='100000'>one water molecule from the metal center.</span> </p><p><span m='103000'>And
  I will represent that here by saying that we would lose</span> <span m='108000'>that
  one water molecule that I've colored this way.</span> </p><p><span m='112000'>And
  that gives us our product, which is very similar to the</span> <span m='116000'>starting
  material in this case, --</span> <span m='120000'>-- except that one water molecule,
  the one here colored</span> <span m='124000'>green, has replaced one of the others.</span>
  </p><p><span m='135000'>And when we look at this type of reaction as a function
  of</span> <span m='139000'>which 3d transition element we have at the center of
  the</span> <span m='144000'>octahedron, we find that the time constant for this
  reaction</span> <span m='149000'>taking place varies quite dramatically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='153000'>And this is informative with respect both to the mechanism
  of</span> <span m='158000'>the reaction, as we will discuss,</span> <span m='161000'>and
  to the electronic structure attributes of the systems that</span> <span m='166000'>control
  the way a metal binds to its ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='170000'>And so, for
  example, let's make a little table of</span> <span m='174000'>the metal n plus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='184000'>And we will take the log of the rate constant for the reaction,</span>
  <span m='189000'>which I will denote with this k.</span> </p><p><span m='191000'>Small
  k is going to be our rate constant.</span> </p><p><span m='195000'>And the units
  that we would find for such a rate constant</span> <span m='199000'>would be reciprocal
  seconds to describe how fast this takes</span> <span m='204000'>place. And, if we
  start down here at</span> <span m='208000'>chromium three plus, we would find that
  the log of</span> <span m='214000'>the rate constant is approximately minus 6.</span>
  </p><p><span m='217000'>And then, if we went to vanadium two plus,</span> <span
  m='222000'>the rate constant log goes to minus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='225000'>So
  the reaction is faster than it is for chromium three.</span> </p><p><span m='230000'>And
  then, if we look at some of</span> <span m='234000'>the other d ions that are possible
  here,</span> <span m='237000'>we could have chromium two plus or copper two plus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='243000'>And, for both of those,</span> <span m='248082'>the log
  of the rate constant is</span> <span m='251000'>You can see, because I am taking
  the log of</span> <span m='254000'>these first order rate constants, the actual
  rates of</span> <span m='259000'>these processes differ here by 15 orders of magnitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m='264000'>That is an enormous difference. So it is not true that whatever</span>
  <span m='270000'>metal ion you have at the center, the rate at which water</span>
  <span m='274000'>comes on and off and it exchanges with water from</span> <span
  m='278000'>solution is about the same. It is not.</span> </p><p><span m='281000'>It
  differs over an enormous range of actual rates,</span> <span m='285000'>many orders
  of magnitude, depending on exactly which</span> <span m='289000'>metal ion you have
  here. And so I will classify these as</span> <span m='294000'>either slow or fast.
  And we will say that here,</span> <span m='297000'>we are slow. And here we are
  fast.</span> </p><p><span m='301000'>And, of course, there are cases that are</span>
  <span m='304000'>somewhat in between. But I will be giving you a</span> <span m='308000'>little
  bit of nomenclature that arises from the study of such</span> <span m='312000'>ligand
  substitution rates in a little while.</span> </p><p><span m='316000'>Here is one
  type of substitution reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='319000'>Now, I would like
  you to consider a different type of</span> <span m='323000'>substitution reaction,
  one that does not have a</span> <span m='326000'>product that is essentially identical
  to the starting</span> <span m='330000'>material. And that will be one as shown</span>
  <span m='336000'>here. Let's use the metal tungsten at</span> <span m='340000'>the
  bottom of Group 6, a 5d transition element.</span> </p><p><span m='346000'>This
  makes a very stable binary compound with carbon monoxide in</span> <span m='354000'>which
  six carbon monoxide ligands bind to the metal center</span> <span m='361000'>at
  the corners of an octahedron. And in this tungsten</span> <span m='368000'>hexacarbonyl
  system, you are going to find that,</span> <span m='373000'>as you will be seeing
  in recitation this week,</span> <span m='378000'>these CO ligands are pi-acids,
  they are very high in the</span> <span m='384000'>spectrochemical series. This leads
  to a molecule like</span> <span m='389000'>this being colorless.</span> </p><p><span
  m='398000'>It has a large delta O.</span> </p><p><span m='404000'>And because ligands
  are pi-acidic and the metal center,</span> <span m='410000'>as you will see, this
  metal center is a d six</span> <span m='414000'>pi-base, the metal itself is very</span>
  <span m='419000'>electronically complimentary to its set of six carbon monoxide</span>
  <span m='426000'>ligands. So a system like this is very</span> <span m='430000'>stable.
  And what you might like to do</span> <span m='432000'>is to tag some biomolecule
  with a tungsten pentacarbonyl</span> <span m='437000'>fragment, so that you could
  use the vibrational spectroscopy</span> <span m='441000'>associated with these CO
  oscillators to watch some</span> <span m='445000'>biological process that has that
  thing attached to it.</span> </p><p><span m='450000'>And one example of a substitution
  reaction you might</span> <span m='454000'>wish to use would be the one shown here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='458000'>This ligand that I am currently sketching is one in which
  we</span> <span m='463000'>have a phosphorus with a lone pair and three phenyl groups</span>
  <span m='468000'>attached to it. A phenyl group is a benzene</span> <span m='472000'>ring
  where one of the positions is substituted.</span> </p><p><span m='476000'>This ligand
  here, then, is triphenylphosphine,</span> <span m='480000'>and this is a good ligand
  for various types of metals.</span> </p><p><span m='497000'>And, in fact, one of
  the Nobel laureates that</span> <span m='500000'>I may have mentioned in passing
  this semester,</span> <span m='503000'>Sir Jeffrey Wilkinson, used triphenylphosphine
  as a</span> <span m='507000'>ligand in the preparation of what is now universally
  known as</span> <span m='511000'>Wilkinson's hydrogenation catalyst.</span> </p><p><span
  m='515000'>So this ligand is quite common, indeed, and well-known.</span> </p><p><span
  m='519000'>And what we might like to do is to replace one carbon monoxide</span>
  <span m='524000'>with this triphenylphosphine ligand.</span> </p><p><span m='527000'>That
  would be a simple substitution reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='531000'>We would
  like one equivalent of carbon monoxide to be evolved as</span> <span m='537000'>CO
  gas in this reaction. But we find that we can put</span> <span m='542000'>tungsten
  hexacarbonyl in the presence of triphenylphosphine,</span> <span m='547000'>and
  nothing really happens. They just sit there and look at</span> <span m='552000'>each
  other. They do not react.</span> </p><p><span m='554000'>So one of the things that
  happens when you are learning to</span> <span m='559000'>do synthetic chemistry
  is that the outcome of a reaction can be</span> <span m='565000'>either that it
  proceeded cleanly onto products.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>And one possible
  outcome is there was no reaction at all.</span> </p><p><span m='575000'>And so this
  is what we will call no thermal reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='579000'>And that
  means that just with the energy supplied by the</span> <span m='585000'>temperature
  of the room, the reaction is not proceeding</span> <span m='589000'>in the forward
  direction. And what that may mean is that</span> <span m='595000'>there is an energy
  barrier to this reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>And energy barriers are
  going to be a topic of this lecture in</span> <span m='605000'>a few moments, but
  there may be an energy</span> <span m='609000'>barrier. And we don't have sufficient</span>
  <span m='613000'>energy to surmount the barrier, so the substitution reaction is</span>
  <span m='618000'>not taking place. But we find that if we shine</span> <span m='623000'>light
  on the system, UV light, then the reaction</span> <span m='627000'>takes place.
  And we form this desired</span> <span m='632000'>product that has one of the carbon
  monoxide ligands replaced</span> <span m='637000'>with triphenylphosphine. That
  would be the initial</span> <span m='642000'>product formed in such a process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='651000'>Still octahedral, now five CO ligands instead of</span>
  <span m='654000'>six, and one of them replaced by triphenylphosphine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='659000'>And it occurs under the action of UV light.</span> </p><p><span m='663000'>If
  you put a photon into the system for some reason,</span> <span m='666000'>we can
  now surmount the energy barrier to the reaction,</span> <span m='670000'>blow one
  of the CO molecules away as CO gas.</span> </p><p><span m='674000'>We might, in
  fact, in practice,</span> <span m='676000'>possibly be bubbling an inert gas like
  N two through</span> <span m='680000'>the solution to sweep the evolved carbon monoxide
  out of</span> <span m='684000'>the system to help the reaction go to completion
  as we are</span> <span m='689000'>carrying out such a prep. But, in any event,</span>
  <span m='693000'>the key feature is that it goes under photolysis in the presence</span>
  <span m='698000'>of a UV lamp but not simply through input of normal thermal</span>
  <span m='703000'>energy. And, in thinking back to the</span> <span m='706000'>development
  of the electronic structure of systems of this</span> <span m='711000'>type, we
  can actually begin to understand this.</span> </p><p><span m='716000'>Because we
  have an energy diagram, a d orbital splitting</span> <span m='721000'>diagram for
  simplicity, where we have our t(2g) set and</span> <span m='725000'>our e(g)*. And
  tungsten is in Group 6,</span> <span m='729000'>the ligands are all neutral, so
  this is d six.</span> </p><p><span m='734000'>This is a common electron count for
  octahedral systems that are</span> <span m='739000'>quite stable. And CO is high
  in the</span> <span m='743000'>spectrochemical series, so it leads to a large value
  of</span> <span m='747000'>delta O. This splitting here between</span> <span m='753000'>t(2g)
  and e(g) is large. And that means we have an s</span> <span m='758000'>equals zero
  state, with the system not being</span> <span m='763000'>paramagnetic, all the electrons
  paired up in</span> <span m='768000'>t(2g) and this big gap. And what happens when
  we add a</span> <span m='774000'>photon to the system, we can promote the system
  into</span> <span m='779000'>an excited state. And, in order to satisfy the</span>
  <span m='785000'>spin selection rule, this excited state will have no</span> <span
  m='789000'>net spin polarization. This one is s equals zero,</span> <span m='794000'>this
  one is s equals zero to satisfy the spin selection rule</span> <span m='799000'>that
  we have talked about. But notice, now,</span> <span m='803000'>in the excited state
  --</span> <span m='814000'>-- we have an electron in e g star.</span> </p><p><span
  m='817000'>And, as I was discussing last time, when you look at the MO</span> <span
  m='822000'>theory for a problem like this, e(g)* is sigma antibonding with</span>
  <span m='827000'>respect to the ligands. I am going to illuminate that</span> <span
  m='831000'>for you very clearly in a few moments with a graphic,</span> <span m='835000'>but
  this is sigma star with respect to the ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='840000'>So
  what are we doing? We are taking an electron,</span> <span m='843000'>here, that
  is pi bonding because CO is a pi-acid ligand.</span> </p><p><span m='847000'>In
  the ground state, this electron that we are going</span> <span m='851000'>to promote
  is helping to bind the carbon monoxide ligands to</span> <span m='856000'>the metal.
  And then, when we input that</span> <span m='859000'>photon and we produce an excited
  state, that same electron now</span> <span m='864000'>has been taken away from our
  sum total of bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='869000'>And it has been added to an
  antibonding orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>And the effect of that is to
  "labialize" one of the carbon</span> <span m='879000'>monoxide ligands, allowing
  it to dissociate from</span> <span m='884000'>the metal center producing an unsaturated
  intermediate that</span> <span m='890000'>can be captured by the lone pair of triphenylphosphine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='896000'>That word I just used, labialized, we have from Henry</span>
  <span m='902000'>Taube.</span> </p><p><span m='913000'>Henry Taube, Nobel Prize
  in 1983.</span> </p><p><span m='916000'>If you want to read more about Henry Taube
  and his</span> <span m='920000'>contributions to chemistry and, in fact, the study
  of ligand</span> <span m='926000'>substitution reactions and the relationship of
  reaction rates</span> <span m='932000'>to the population of the e g star orbitals,</span>
  <span m='937000'>then I would direct you to the 1983 section of the Nobel Prize</span>
  <span m='943000'>dot org website. And you can read his biography,</span> <span m='948000'>his
  Nobel Prize lecture and his banquet address.</span> </p><p><span m='951000'>These
  are all things that Professor Schrock from our</span> <span m='955000'>department
  is doing this week in Sweden, so shortly,</span> <span m='959000'>you will be able
  to read his contributions to that website.</span> </p><p><span m='964000'>And I
  am sure you will all find that to be pretty exciting,</span> <span m='972000'>as
  I do. But Henry Taube,</span> <span m='975000'>this Nobel Prize winner, coined the
  terms "inert" and</span> <span m='983000'>"labile." These terms,</span> <span m='986000'>inert
  and labile, they refer to rates of ligand</span> <span m='993000'>substitution reactions.
  If a complex is to be thought</span> <span m='1001000'>of as inert, it isn't really
  inert.</span> </p><p><span m='1004000'>What that means is that its substitution
  reactions are slow.</span> </p><p><span m='1011000'>And, on the other hand, if a
  system is to be referred</span> <span m='1016000'>to labile, that means that its
  ligand substitution reactions</span> <span m='1023000'>are fast. And over there
  on the left,</span> <span m='1027000'>we looked at a set of four metal ions whose
  aqua-complexes</span> <span m='1033000'>could be classified as either inert or as
  labile.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>So let me relate that to the occupation
  of the eg star</span> <span m='1043000'>energy level. Here what we have,</span>
  <span m='1047000'>t(2g) and e(g)*. In the case of chromium three</span> <span m='1052000'>plus
  or vanadium two plus,</span> <span m='1057000'>since vanadium is in Group 5 and
  chromium is in Group 6,</span> <span m='1062000'>both of these metal ions have a
  d three electron</span> <span m='1068000'>configuration. And so, when we populate
  our</span> <span m='1072000'>d-orbital splitting diagram for these two systems,</span>
  <span m='1077000'>here is the result. We have an s equals</span> <span m='1081000'>three-halves
  ground state, three unpaired electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='1085000'>The system
  is paramagnetic. You could certainly calculate</span> <span m='1090000'>the spin-only
  magnetic moment for such a system.</span> </p><p><span m='1094000'>And e(g)* is
  not occupied. We have three electrons,</span> <span m='1099000'>here, in t(2g).
  t(2g) is basically nonbonding</span> <span m='1102000'>if the ligand is neither
  a pi-base nor a pi-acid.</span> </p><p><span m='1108000'>This is three nonbonding
  electrons centered in d(xz),</span> <span m='1113000'>d(yz), and d(xy), which is
  t(2g) on our metal ion</span> <span m='1119000'>chromium three plus in the hexa-aquo
  system or</span> <span m='1125000'>vanadium two plus in the hexa-aquo system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1131000'>And these are inert and slow. And then, we have two more</span>
  <span m='1137000'>cases to discuss. And, again, here is our t(2g)</span> <span m='1142000'>and
  our e(g)*. Notice that if we go from</span> <span m='1147000'>chromium three plus
  to chromium two plus,</span> <span m='1151000'>we go up 15 orders of magnitude in
  ligand</span> <span m='1156000'>substitution rate just by changing the charge by
  one unit.</span> </p><p><span m='1161000'>And what is going on here? Well, now chromium
  two</span> <span m='1165000'>is d four, and the four electrons go in</span> <span
  m='1170000'>and populate like this. So eg* now has an electron in</span> <span m='1176000'>it.
  And that makes it related to</span> <span m='1179000'>the excited state here of
  tungsten hexacarbonyl because</span> <span m='1183000'>both of those, if you were
  to write out their</span> <span m='1187000'>electronic configuration, would have
  eg*1 as the</span> <span m='1191000'>population of eg*. In the case of copper two
  plus,</span> <span m='1195000'>we have a situation similar to chromium two plus</span>
  <span m='1201000'>in that the complex is labile.</span> </p><p><span m='1206000'>It
  is undergoing substitution associated with a rate constant</span> <span m='1212000'>here
  whose log is 9. This is undergoing exchange of</span> <span m='1218000'>water molecules
  from liquid solution onto the metal very</span> <span m='1224000'>rapidly. And this
  is a d nine</span> <span m='1228000'>case. The electrons go in like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1232000'>And this is an s equals one-half system with a single</span>
  <span m='1236000'>unpaired electron. Both of these are paramagnetic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1241000'>Both of these have a population of e g star.</span> </p><p><span m='1245000'>And
  the two ions that have e(g)* that contain electrons</span> <span m='1250000'>have
  fast ligand exchange rates. When e(g)* is not occupied,</span> <span m='1255000'>the
  ligand substitution rates are very slow.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>And we
  can understand that because of the antibonding</span> <span m='1265000'>character
  of e(g)*. There is an additional nuance,</span> <span m='1271000'>which is when
  e(g)* is occupied by an odd number of electrons,</span> <span m='1277000'>we can
  get what is called a Jahn-Teller distortion.</span> </p><p><span m='1283000'>And
  that distortion is a structural response to the odd</span> <span m='1289000'>electronic
  population of e(g)*. It is a distortion of the</span> <span m='1295000'>molecule
  that makes these systems, the chromium two</span> <span m='1299000'>and copper two
  the fastest of all</span> <span m='1303000'>the 3d metal ions for exchanging water
  molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1306000'>Let's look at a structure of one of these
  systems briefly.</span> </p><p><span m='1310000'>Here is the result of a quantum
  chemical calculation optimizing</span> <span m='1314000'>the structure of chromium
  two hexaaquo two plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1317000'>This system as a spin</span>
  <span m='1321000'>polarization of four, meaning we do have the four</span> <span
  m='1324000'>unpaired electrons, three of which are in t(2g) and</span> <span m='1328000'>one
  of which is in e(g)*. This is how the molecule</span> <span m='1332000'>optimizes
  without using any symmetry constraints based on</span> <span m='1336000'>the density
  functional theory model that is typically in use</span> <span m='1340000'>these
  days for optimizing geometries of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1343000'>And
  what you can see is that this program I am using to</span> <span m='1347000'>display
  the structure is drawing four of the lines from the</span> <span m='1351000'>chromium
  ion to the oxygens. And the other two it is not</span> <span m='1357000'>drawing.
  And the reason for that,</span> <span m='1359000'>if I go ahead and use the tools
  in this program to find out just</span> <span m='1364000'>what are those chromium
  oxygen distances in this hexaaquo ion,</span> <span m='1369000'>what we find out
  is that four of them, the four where it is</span> <span m='1374000'>choosing to
  draw the lines between the metal and the</span> <span m='1378000'>oxygen, are about
  2.1 angstroms. Whereas, to the two oxygens</span> <span m='1384000'>where it is
  not drawing the metal oxygen line,</span> <span m='1388000'>the distance is about
  2.45 angstroms.</span> </p><p><span m='1391000'>This molecule, this hexaaquo ion,</span>
  <span m='1394000'>has decided to deviate from a pure octahedral geometry because</span>
  <span m='1400000'>what it has done is it has stretched two of the oxygens</span>
  <span m='1404000'>along an axis and made those two water molecules move farther</span>
  <span m='1410000'>away from the metal center. And that has to do with the</span>
  <span m='1416000'>Jahn-Teller distortion that I mentioned a moment ago,</span> <span
  m='1420000'>when e(g)* is occupied by an odd number of electrons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1425000'>Now, if you see that two waters have moved far away from the</span>
  <span m='1430000'>metal and four are in closer as a result of how e(g)* is</span>
  <span m='1435000'>populated, then which d orbital do you think has the e(g)*</span>
  <span m='1440000'>electron? d z squared*,</span> <span m='1443000'>that is right.
  And that means the two</span> <span m='1446000'>molecules that can interact with
  the two big lobes of d z squared</span> <span m='1451000'>along the axis, those
  are repelled away from</span> <span m='1454000'>the metal more than the other four
  that are in the x,y-plane</span> <span m='1459000'>because we don't have any electron
  in x squared minus y</span> <span m='1463000'>squared, that other component of e(g)*.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1468000'>This molecule achieves its most stable structure by distorting</span>
  <span m='1473000'>in response to the unequal occupation of e(g)*.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1477000'>And I will just show you what that orbital looks like by</span> <span
  m='1482000'>quitting out of there.</span> </p><p><span m='1490000'>Now this graphic,
  sadly, isn't as nice as the one</span> <span m='1493000'>I could have shown you
  using my laptop and VMD,</span> <span m='1497000'>but it will have to serve the
  purpose.</span> </p><p><span m='1500000'>And this is just a snapshot of the orbital.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1503000'>It may not be possible to increase the size of this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1515000'>Here we go. I think it should be clear,</span> <span m='1517000'>from
  your inspection of this diagram, that we actually</span> <span m='1521000'>superposed
  a couple of different representations of the system on</span> <span m='1526000'>top
  of one another. First of all,</span> <span m='1528000'>this program has drawn balls
  and sticks to connect the atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='1532000'>You have a red
  ball here, a red ball.</span> </p><p><span m='1535000'>Each place there is a red
  ball, that is an oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='1538000'>And at the center, we have
  our chromium plus two</span> <span m='1542000'>ion. So these are our water</span>
  <span m='1544000'>molecules. And what you should be able to</span> <span m='1549000'>see
  here is that this orbital, on this water molecule up here</span> <span m='1553000'>along
  positive z, has an appearance that would</span> <span m='1556000'>suggest that that
  is the highest occupied molecular orbital of</span> <span m='1561000'>the water
  molecule, interacting with the big lobe</span> <span m='1564000'>of d z squared
  in this antibonding fashion where</span> <span m='1568000'>we go from blue phase
  to red phase as we go along the sigma</span> <span m='1572000'>axis between the
  oxygen and the metal center.</span> </p><p><span m='1577000'>And then, in a better
  representation,</span> <span m='1579000'>you would be able to see that there are
  small contributions</span> <span m='1582000'>from the four water molecules that
  are interacting here with</span> <span m='1586000'>the torus of the d z squared
  orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1589000'>And then what you have down on negative
  z is equal to what you</span> <span m='1593000'>have on positive z. Namely, you
  have an oxygen lone</span> <span m='1597000'>pair here that is being repelled by
  the electron occupying d z</span> <span m='1601000'>squared, which is one of our
  e(g)</span> <span m='1603000'>components. The idea is that systems like</span> <span
  m='1606000'>this exchange water so very rapidly, 15 orders of magnitude</span> <span
  m='1610000'>more rapidly than a simple d three system,</span> <span m='1613000'>because
  two of the water molecules are repelled away from</span> <span m='1617000'>the metal
  center quite a bit. And it makes this structure</span> <span m='1621000'>close to
  the transition state for just losing a water molecule</span> <span m='1625000'>from
  the coordination sphere and dissociating it from the metal</span> <span m='1629000'>center.
  And that is what we are going</span> <span m='1631000'>to talk about next.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1656000'>Now, we are going to talk about a reaction like that in
  terms of</span> <span m='1661000'>a potential energy surface diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1686000'>We have seen how d orbital occupation affects color and</span> <span
  m='1690000'>magnetism and bonding between metals and ligands.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1693000'>And now we are seeing how actually we can interpret</span> <span m='1697000'>chemical
  reaction rates on the basis of these electronic</span> <span m='1701000'>structure
  considerations.</span> </p><p><span m='1711000'>We like to draw energy level diagrams
  that have orbitals on</span> <span m='1715000'>them or states on them, but sometimes
  what we like to</span> <span m='1719000'>do is to try to describe the total energy
  of the system,</span> <span m='1723000'>fold all these different coordinates into
  one and look at</span> <span m='1727000'>the total energy of the system as a function
  of where we are</span> <span m='1731000'>along a chemical reaction coordinate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1735000'>That means as we progress through a sequence of elementary</span>
  <span m='1740000'>steps corresponding to a chemical reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1745000'>A complete description of any reaction implies a knowledge of</span>
  <span m='1751000'>the potential energy surface for the reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1762000'>We have our reaction coordinate, and we desire some</span> <span m='1765000'>kind
  of a plot that could represent this reaction</span> <span m='1769000'>coordinate.
  And what that plot looks like</span> <span m='1772000'>depends on the particular
  reaction mechanism of the</span> <span m='1776000'>reaction that you are scrutinizing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1780000'>If you have a reaction and you want to know how it works,</span>
  <span m='1783000'>the first thing you do is make a hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1785000'>And from your hypothesis, you can build predictions about</span> <span
  m='1789000'>the reaction coordinate, and then you can test those</span> <span m='1792000'>experimentally.
  And either your hypothesis will</span> <span m='1795000'>turn out to be consistent
  with the predictions or not.</span> </p><p><span m='1799000'>And, if not, you reject
  the hypothesis and</span> <span m='1802000'>start again. It has been said,</span>
  <span m='1804000'>concerning reaction mechanisms, that the closest you can get to</span>
  <span m='1808000'>the truth is your own best guess.</span> </p><p><span m='1811000'>But
  the way that people test reaction mechanisms is through</span> <span m='1815000'>studying
  reaction rates under various conditions and comparing</span> <span m='1819000'>the
  results to those predicted by your hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span m='1823000'>And
  so here is a hypothesis for a dissociative mechanism for the</span> <span m='1828000'>type
  of ligand substitution reaction that we are talking</span> <span m='1832000'>about.
  A dissociative mechanism means</span> <span m='1837000'>that the mechanism proceeds
  by dissociation of one of the</span> <span m='1844000'>ligands from the metal center
  as the first important step of the</span> <span m='1852000'>reaction. We have down
  here some ML five</span> <span m='1856000'>X compound. And let's say we have it
  in a</span> <span m='1862000'>solvent Y, where the solvent can also act as a ligand.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1868000'>And we are interested in what rate profile will we have
  if,</span> <span m='1874000'>at the end of the reaction, down here in this well,</span>
  <span m='1879000'>this is meant to represent a potential energy well where now</span>
  <span m='1885000'>we have X replaced by Y, --</span> <span m='1895000'>-- as illustrated
  there. That is the overall result of</span> <span m='1898000'>the reaction. But
  how does it take place?</span> </p><p><span m='1901000'>Are there any intermediates
  in the reaction?</span> </p><p><span m='1904000'>And so, in a dissociative mechanism,
  what happens is that</span> <span m='1908000'>there is an intermediate. And it occurs
  here in this</span> <span m='1912000'>intermediate well. One thing that you are
  going to</span> <span m='1915000'>be interested in distinguishing between, on potential
  energy</span> <span m='1920000'>diagrams, will be potential energy minima.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1924000'>Because these potential energy minima that I have just
  colored</span> <span m='1928000'>in, those correspond to starting materials, products,</span>
  <span m='1931000'>or intermediates. And then, alternatively,</span> <span m='1934000'>you
  can have potential energy maxima on the potential energy</span> <span m='1938000'>surface.
  This is a two-dimensional</span> <span m='1940000'>diagram. And what it really represents</span>
  <span m='1942000'>is a two-dimensional slice through a three-dimensional</span>
  <span m='1946000'>surface that has hills and valleys on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1950000'>And these hills on the potential energy surface</span> <span m='1954000'>represent
  energy barriers to a chemical reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1958000'>What we
  are going to have at these points of high energy will</span> <span m='1964000'>be
  things that we call transition states.</span> </p><p><span m='1979000'>And you start
  out down here at the starting materials,</span> <span m='1983000'>the reaction will
  proceed to the right, we are assuming in</span> <span m='1987000'>this case, and
  you go up hill in energy first.</span> </p><p><span m='1991000'>You have to surmount
  this energy barrier associated with</span> <span m='1995000'>this first transition
  state, or TS1.</span> </p><p><span m='1998000'>And when you system has gone over
  that first barrier,</span> <span m='2002000'>if it is a dissociative mechanism,
  that produces an</span> <span m='2006000'>intermediate ML five. Because X has dissociated
  from</span> <span m='2012000'>the metal center and Y, of course, being the solvent,</span>
  <span m='2016000'>is still there. And then, once we get down into</span> <span m='2020000'>this
  well, this potential energy minimum, this valley associated</span> <span m='2025000'>with
  the intermediate ML five, it is a five coordinate</span> <span m='2030000'>intermediate,
  so it should have a structure</span> <span m='2033000'>of the trigonal bipyramid
  or the structure of a square pyramid.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>And, over
  there, I was talking about the</span> <span m='2042000'>distortion of that molecule
  based on its occupation of e(g)*</span> <span m='2046000'>having repelled two of
  the water molecules farther away from the</span> <span m='2050000'>metal than the
  other four. And what that does is it begins</span> <span m='2054000'>to lower the
  energy barrier here to get over to TS1.</span> </p><p><span m='2058000'>It makes
  it easier for one ligand to fall off the metal</span> <span m='2062000'>center because
  it is being repelled by that d z squared</span> <span m='2065000'>electron. And
  what we will see is that we</span> <span m='2070000'>can associate rate constants
  with each of these barriers.</span> </p><p><span m='2073000'>This is the second
  instance today that I have used the term</span> <span m='2077000'>rate constant.
  And we are going to want to</span> <span m='2080000'>distinguish the term "rate
  constant" from the term</span> <span m='2083000'>"reaction rate." And one of our
  goals today is</span> <span m='2086000'>to understand the difference between a reaction
  rate and a</span> <span m='2090000'>rate constant. Going up this first hill,</span>
  <span m='2093000'>over TS1 and down into the intermediate state,</span> <span m='2096000'>where
  you have a five coordinate species and X has</span> <span m='2100000'>become freely
  dissociated from the metal center,</span> <span m='2103000'>that is k1. And then,
  when you are down in</span> <span m='2106000'>the valley, there are two ways out
  of the valley.</span> </p><p><span m='2109000'>You can either go back in the direction
  of TS1.</span> </p><p><span m='2112000'>We call that back reaction k minus one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2116000'>We associate the rate constant k minus one with the back</span>
  <span m='2119000'>reaction that would take us back over the same transition state</span>
  <span m='2124000'>and back to the starting materials.</span> </p><p><span m='2128000'>That
  would be a nonproductive step because it is going in the</span> <span m='2132000'>wrong
  direction. And then, over here,</span> <span m='2135000'>ML five has this branching
  option.</span> </p><p><span m='2139000'>When you are at the stage of the intermediate,</span>
  <span m='2142000'>you can go either back to starting materials or you can go</span>
  <span m='2147000'>onto products. And this rate constant we will</span> <span m='2151000'>call
  k two for the reaction in which the molecule Y</span> <span m='2155000'>that is
  doing the substituting would add to ML five.</span> </p><p><span m='2162000'>That
  is associated with some barrier.</span> </p><p><span m='2164000'>And it produces
  the six coordinate ML five Y and X</span> <span m='2168000'>dissociated. And then,
  finally,</span> <span m='2172000'>in this last step we would call the rate constant
  associated</span> <span m='2177000'>with going back into the intermediate from the
  products,</span> <span m='2181000'>we would call that k minus two for that rate</span>
  <span m='2185000'>constant. This is how you begin to write</span> <span m='2188000'>out
  the math associated with a hypothetical reaction mechanism.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2195000'>And so, for those of you who are gearing up to take 18.03</span> <span
  m='2198000'>next semester, Differential Equations,</span> <span m='2201000'>you
  are going to find that this is one area in chemistry where</span> <span m='2205000'>differential
  equations become extremely valuable.</span> </p><p><span m='2208000'>Because you
  are going to generate differential equations</span> <span m='2211000'>that describe
  the kinetics of a chemical reaction system.</span> </p><p><span m='2215000'>And
  those equations will differ depending on the hypothetical</span> <span m='2219000'>mechanism.
  And you are going to want to</span> <span m='2223000'>figure out which hypothetical
  mechanism actually fits your</span> <span m='2229000'>data. Here is one limiting
  case,</span> <span m='2232000'>but let me first just --</span> <span m='2245000'>I
  am going to leave that, given the amount of time here.</span> </p><p><span m='2249000'>We
  are going to go ahead and talk about a limiting case.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>When
  I use square brackets here, I am going to be talking</span> <span m='2284000'>about
  concentration, just like we did when we were</span> <span m='2287000'>talking about
  acids and bases and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2290000'>Square brackets denote
  concentrations.</span> </p><p><span m='2294000'>If k2 times Y, and I will stick
  with the green</span> <span m='2299000'>color for Y, is much greater than k minus
  one times the</span> <span m='2306000'>concentration of X, hat corresponds to</span>
  <span m='2314000'>a limiting case. We are also going to make</span> <span m='2319000'>another
  assumption, here.</span> </p><p><span m='2322000'>We are going to say assuming complete
  reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2338000'>What does that mean? That means that k
  minus two</span> <span m='2341000'>times the concentration of ML five Y times the
  concentration</span> <span m='2346000'>of X at the end corresponds to essentially</span>
  <span m='2351000'>a negligible back reaction such that when we get to products we</span>
  <span m='2356000'>stop, this is a very deep well, and we don't go back anymore</span>
  <span m='2361000'>once we get over to the products.</span> </p><p><span m='2364000'>Under
  those conditions, we have made two</span> <span m='2367000'>simplifications. Then,
  the reaction rate.</span> </p><p><span m='2377000'>And, when we talk about reaction
  rate,</span> <span m='2380000'>we usually define it in terms of the disappearance
  of the</span> <span m='2384000'>starting materials or alternatively the appearance
  of</span> <span m='2389000'>the products, the rate of appearance of the</span> <span
  m='2392000'>products in a system like this. And, under the conditions of</span>
  <span m='2397000'>those assumptions, the reaction rate is going to</span> <span
  m='2401000'>depend on k1 times the concentration of the starting</span> <span m='2406000'>material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2414000'>Times the concentration of our entering group Y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2419000'>And that says that every time we get over the first barrier,</span>
  <span m='2425000'>we rapidly get over the second barrier without going back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2432000'>That is the assumption here that k two times the</span>
  <span m='2436000'>concentration of Y is much greater than k minus one times</span>
  <span m='2441000'>the concentration of X. This is</span> <span m='2446000'>often
  true when the concentration of Y is very</span> <span m='2450000'>great.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2458000'>i.e., Y is the solvent.</span> </p><p><span m='2466000'>In
  the case of water, you have essentially 12 molar</span> <span m='2470000'>Y. Y is
  your solvent.</span> </p><p><span m='2471000'>And, because of that, under these
  circumstances,</span> <span m='2475000'>the concentration of Y, which is very large,</span>
  <span m='2479000'>does not change effectively during the reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2483000'>It is a constant that can be folded into together with the</span> <span
  m='2488000'>constant k1. So we can describe this as k</span> <span m='2493000'>observed.
  K observed is equal to k1 times</span> <span m='2498000'>Y times ML five X. And</span>
  <span m='2503000'>these are what we call pseudo-first order conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2536000'>That is a particularly simple rate law.</span> </p><p><span m='2538000'>And
  a lot of times, experimentalists will engender</span> <span m='2542000'>pseudo-first
  order conditions by purposely using an entering</span> <span m='2547000'>group concentration
  that is very large.</span> </p><p><span m='2551000'>And, when you do that, you will
  find that,</span> <span m='2556000'>for example, the change in concentration</span>
  <span m='2560000'>with time of ML five X is, upon integration,</span> <span m='2567000'>when
  you integrate differential equations such as this,</span> <span m='2573000'>you
  can obtain expressions for the concentrations of these</span> <span m='2580000'>species
  of interest as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='2587000'>So we can obtain
  ML five X of t divided by ML five X at t equals</span> <span m='2597000'>zero is
  equal to e to the minus k observed, that contains that</span> <span m='2606000'>large
  invariant concentration of y folded into it times t.</span> </p><p><span m='2624000'>Hence,
  this single exponential decay of the starting materials</span> <span m='2628000'>predicted
  by this mechanism under these conditions for the</span> <span m='2633000'>change
  in concentration with time of your starting material.</span> </p><p><span m='2644000'>Finally,
  what you do seek is to follow, as a function of time,</span> <span m='2652000'>the
  concentration of the species involved such that,</span> <span m='2658000'>for example,
  you may be following,</span> <span m='2663000'>here, the decay of your starting
  species ML five X.</span> </p><p><span m='2669000'>As a function of time,</span>
  <span m='2673000'>you seek an expression for that.</span> </p><p><span m='2676000'>There
  are different methods to carry out the integration</span> <span m='2681000'>required
  for more complicated rate laws than did appear there</span> <span m='2686000'>for
  the pseudo first-order mechanism.</span> </p><p><span m='2689000'>But, simultaneously,
  as ML five X decays,</span> <span m='2693000'>the concentration of ML five Y would
  be increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>And under the simple case shown here,
  where the intermediate</span> <span m='2706000'>does not build up to any substantial
  concentration,</span> <span m='2712000'>this is no buildup of intermediate,</span>
  <span m='2716000'>meaning whenever the intermediate is formed it either</span> <span
  m='2722000'>goes back to starting materials or goes on to products.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2735000'>In other words, the intermediate never attains</span> <span m='2763000'>significant
  concentrations relative to starting materials</span> <span m='2798000'>and final
  products. This is the basis for the</span> <span m='2826000'>steady state approximation
  that is explained in your notes.</span> </p><p><span m='2863000'>And I will go through
  that also at the beginning of the hour on</span> <span m='2902000'>Friday. Have
  a nice day.</span> </p>
