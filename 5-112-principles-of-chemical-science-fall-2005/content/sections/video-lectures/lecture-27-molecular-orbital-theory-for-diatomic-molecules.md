  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>At the end of last hour,
  we had just gotten to the point</span> <span m='18000'>of having developed the molecular
  orbital energy level</span> <span m='22000'>diagram for the BH three molecule, this
  trigonal planar</span> <span m='27000'>entity. And I had not had time last</span>
  <span m='29000'>hour to show you what these molecular orbitals look like in</span>
  <span m='33000'>their calculated form. And so, I am going to start off</span> <span
  m='38000'>today by doing that, and then will proceed to answer</span> <span m='41000'>a
  quadrangle of questions that we can attack regarding diatomic</span> <span m='45000'>molecules
  using molecular orbital theory.</span> </p><p><span m='48000'>Remember that the
  BH three MO problem is a seven</span> <span m='51000'>orbital problem. And so, we
  will go through and</span> <span m='55000'>just look at these seven molecular orbitals
  in ascending</span> <span m='58000'>energy from the lowest energy on up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='62000'>This one is the lowest energy molecular orbital for BH three</span>
  <span m='66000'>as calculated using a modern quantum chemical package.</span> </p><p><span
  m='72000'>And what you can see is that since we are indicating the</span> <span
  m='76000'>phase of the wave function by color, there is only one phase</span> <span
  m='81000'>to be seen. This, of course,</span> <span m='84000'>is a characteristic
  property of an s orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='87000'>Remember that? And what
  we have here,</span> <span m='91000'>at the center of the molecule, is the 2s orbital
  on boron.</span> </p><p><span m='96000'>And in this molecular orbital theory, effectively
  what is</span> <span m='100000'>happening is that 2s orbital on boron is reaching
  out and</span> <span m='104000'>simultaneously overlapping with the three 1s orbitals
  on each of</span> <span m='109000'>the hydrogens. And the way that we have</span>
  <span m='112000'>orthogonalized it and normalized it amounts to a single molecular</span>
  <span m='117000'>orbital that can, if you will,</span> <span m='120000'>house a
  pair of electrons in this orbital that is</span> <span m='123000'>simultaneously
  bonding between boron and the three hydrogens.</span> </p><p><span m='130000'>You
  have one electron pair in here.</span> </p><p><span m='132000'>Two of the six electrons
  in the valance shell of this molecule</span> <span m='137000'>are in this lowest
  lying, most tightly held,</span> <span m='141000'>most electronegative molecular
  orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='144000'>Let's look now at the next one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='160000'>You should be thinking in your mind just what was the next</span> <span
  m='164000'>highest lying orbital that we had, and you will realize that</span> <span
  m='169000'>this is an orbital formed from one of the boron p orbitals and</span>
  <span m='173000'>a linear combination of two of the hydrogen wave functions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179000'>And let's see if you can recognize it based on what we</span>
  <span m='184000'>did last time. Maybe I can reorient it to help</span> <span m='188000'>in
  that regard. Here is a molecular orbital</span> <span m='192000'>that can house
  a pair of electrons, one spin-up and one</span> <span m='197000'>spin-down, and
  that is simultaneously bonding from that</span> <span m='202000'>boron to this hydrogen,
  up here.</span> </p><p><span m='207000'>And then there is a nodal surface, here,</span>
  <span m='209000'>that is coincident with the nodal surfaces of the boron 2px</span>
  <span m='213000'>orbital, using the same coordinate system that we were</span> <span
  m='216000'>using last time. And so, the wave function</span> <span m='219000'>changes
  sign as you pass through the boron.</span> </p><p><span m='222000'>And then the
  opposite phase lobe of the boron 2px orbital is</span> <span m='226000'>able to
  overlap with these two hydrogens, here.</span> </p><p><span m='229000'>If you will
  remember, when I wrote down the</span> <span m='232000'>normalization constants
  for this molecular orbital,</span> <span m='235000'>we had double the coefficient
  on the hydrogen up here as</span> <span m='238000'>compared with the two hydrogens
  down here.</span> </p><p><span m='243000'>And they were opposite in sign. And that
  leads to a really nice</span> <span m='247000'>overlap, as you can see here. This
  is BH bonding here,</span> <span m='251000'>and BH bonding, down here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253000'>And it involves that boron 2px orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='256000'>One
  way you can think about this molecular orbital theory is</span> <span m='260000'>that
  this 2px orbital on the central atom is reaching out</span> <span m='265000'>with
  its intrinsic plus-minus phase combination that is</span> <span m='269000'>intrinsic
  to a 2px orbital simultaneously reaching out and</span> <span m='273000'>bonding
  with all three hydrogens in the only way that it can,</span> <span m='278000'>being
  a 2px orbital. And so, we created that linear</span> <span m='283000'>combination
  with that idea in mind.</span> </p><p><span m='286000'>And then, if we go up one
  more in energy, strike that.</span> </p><p><span m='290000'>Not one up more in energy,
  but to the other orbital in the</span> <span m='295000'>molecule that is at the
  same energy.</span> </p><p><span m='298000'>What we will find is that we are involving,</span>
  <span m='302000'>now, the 2py orbital. And it will reach out and</span> <span m='306000'>interact
  with hydrogens in the only way it can,</span> <span m='310000'>given its intrinsic
  nodal properties as a 2py orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='314000'>Remember that
  a 2py orbital has the x,z-plane as a nodal</span> <span m='318000'>surface. And
  there is a hydrogen up here</span> <span m='321000'>on that x,z-plane, namely the
  one that lies on the</span> <span m='324000'>plus x-axis. And because it lies on
  the</span> <span m='327000'>intrinsic nodal surface of this 2py orbital, it can
  contribute</span> <span m='332000'>nothing to this molecular orbital.</span> </p><p><span
  m='336000'>All we are seeing up here at the top is an arbitrarily sized</span> <span
  m='340000'>sphere, just to show the location of that nucleus,</span> <span m='344000'>the
  hydrogen nucleus that is on the plus x-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='347000'>And
  then here, what you see is the 2py orbital</span> <span m='350000'>oriented along
  y and overlapping simultaneously with a plus 1s</span> <span m='355000'>wave function
  here and minus 1s wave function here so that you</span> <span m='359000'>see a beautiful
  bonding molecular orbital that is at the</span> <span m='363000'>same energy at
  the one we just looked at.</span> </p><p><span m='368000'>And so, as you step up
  in energy, looking at the energy</span> <span m='371000'>level diagram for BH three
  from last time,</span> <span m='374000'>that is what you see. We have now six electrons
  in</span> <span m='377000'>the molecule, two in this orbital and two</span> <span
  m='380000'>each in the two orbitals we just looked at that provide the three</span>
  <span m='384000'>BH bonds that we represent in the valance bond theory as</span>
  <span m='387000'>electron pair bonds. But this is a totally different</span> <span
  m='392000'>way of looking at the electronic structure that is very appearing</span>
  <span m='396000'>because it just takes advantage of the atomic orbital properties</span>
  <span m='401000'>that you would calculate for your central atom.</span> </p><p><span
  m='404000'>Now, let's go up one more. The very next one,</span> <span m='408000'>I
  will skip showing to you for purposes of saving time,</span> <span m='411000'>here,
  but you know that the next orbital up is simply the</span> <span m='416000'>2pz
  orbital on the boron, which is our lowest unoccupied</span> <span m='420000'>molecular
  orbital, as well as being an atomic</span> <span m='423000'>orbital in this system
  and responsible for the Lewis acid</span> <span m='427000'>characteristics of this
  species. And one up above that,</span> <span m='432000'>one higher in energy than
  the LUMO is the orbital that I did</span> <span m='436000'>show you last time, the
  out-of-phase combination of</span> <span m='440000'>the boron 2s with the three
  hydrogens all with the same</span> <span m='444000'>sign. It is sort of a round
  nodal</span> <span m='446000'>surface intersection each of the BH bonds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='450000'>And then, finally, orbitals number six and seven</span>
  <span m='454000'>are the antibonding counterparts to the ones that I just showed</span>
  <span m='460000'>you involving boron's 2px and 2py wave functions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='465000'>Here is what these look like. And this one,</span> <span m='469000'>you
  will see, involves the 2px orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='473000'>Here is our x-axis
  pointing up. And the blue lobe of 2px,</span> <span m='478000'>the positive lobe
  here, as you can see,</span> <span m='482000'>is squished out and down. These pictures
  can be a little</span> <span m='487000'>bit more complicated than what we are used
  to looking at from</span> <span m='491000'>just sketching it out on the board or
  the qualitative</span> <span m='494000'>pictures that you sometimes see in your
  textbook.</span> </p><p><span m='496000'>But what we do find here that is the important
  feature is that</span> <span m='500000'>as we go from the 1s contribution on this
  hydrogen</span> <span m='502000'>over here to the positive lobe of 2px we are going
  through a</span> <span m='506000'>nodal surface. And that is antibonding in</span>
  <span m='508000'>character. And you can see that this</span> <span m='511000'>deformation
  of this lobe of the p orbital, of course,</span> <span m='515000'>looks like a high
  energy type of phenomena.</span> </p><p><span m='518000'>And indeed it is. This
  is one of the two highest</span> <span m='521000'>energy orbitals in the energy
  level diagram for the BH three</span> <span m='525000'>molecule. And then, similarly,</span>
  <span m='527000'>here is the other lobe of the 2px orbital, the minus lobe.</span>
  </p><p><span m='531000'>And, as you try to go from it to the adjacent hydrogens,</span>
  <span m='535000'>remember, in the bonding one we were allowing this to overlap</span>
  <span m='539000'>with the same sign on the hydrogens.</span> </p><p><span m='543000'>Now
  we have the opposite sign on the hydrogens,</span> <span m='546000'>so that we have
  a beautiful antibonding node indicated here</span> <span m='550000'>and here between
  the minus phase lobe of 2px and the adjacent</span> <span m='555000'>hydrogens.
  So, this antibonding orbital</span> <span m='557000'>has lots of internuclear nodes,
  nodes that appear between</span> <span m='562000'>nuclei and indicate that we are
  not getting overlapped and</span> <span m='566000'>bonding, but rather we are getting
  a high frequency orbital</span> <span m='570000'>that is likewise high in energy.
  Finally, I will show you the</span> <span m='576000'>counterpart to this one, that
  involves 2py.</span> </p><p><span m='579000'>It is a little easier to understand
  from inspecting it.</span> </p><p><span m='591000'>And it also evinces the internuclear
  nodes that you</span> <span m='595000'>would expect for an antibonding molecular
  orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>And I am orienting it so that you will be
  able to understand</span> <span m='604000'>it with reference to our coordinate system
  as introduced</span> <span m='607000'>last time. And so, you have the boron and</span>
  <span m='610000'>the hydrogen along x, up here.</span> </p><p><span m='612000'>Here
  is our 2py. It is sort of bending away from</span> <span m='615000'>these two hydrogens
  whose wave functions have opposite sign to</span> <span m='619000'>the lobes that
  are directed into their vicinity.</span> </p><p><span m='623000'>You can see that
  we have here a nodal surface between boron and</span> <span m='627000'>this hydrogen
  wherein the bonding counterpart that we</span> <span m='630000'>looked at had the
  same sign and a nice bond.</span> </p><p><span m='635000'>And then over here, once
  again, the mirror image.</span> </p><p><span m='638000'>So, this is one of our final
  orbitals in looking at the BH</span> <span m='642000'>three energy level diagram.</span>
  </p><p><span m='644000'>It is the case that if you start to put electrons into</span>
  <span m='647000'>antibonding orbitals, they will cancel the bonding</span> <span
  m='651000'>properties of the bonding counterparts.</span> </p><p><span m='653000'>And
  we will explore that in quite a bit more detail here</span> <span m='657000'>shortly.
  Let me leave that up there for</span> <span m='662000'>now and tell you what quadrangle
  of problems it is that I hope to</span> <span m='669000'>answer for you today using
  more MO theory ideas.</span> </p><p><span m='675000'>First of these will be why
  He two is so stable?</span> </p><p><span m='687000'>And so, today's lecture is predominantly
  devoted to</span> <span m='693000'>diatomic molecules. And He two will be the</span>
  <span m='699000'>first of these. Let's make this unstable.</span> </p><p><span m='704000'>Let's
  do stable here in just a moment, but first let's say,</span> <span m='712000'>next,
  why does O two have unpaired electrons?</span> </p><p><span m='727000'>Certainly,
  if we draw the valance bond picture for O two,</span> <span m='731000'>like that,
  it does not give us any</span> <span m='734000'>indication that this diatomic molecule
  would have unpaired</span> <span m='739000'>electrons. And so, we are going to see
  how</span> <span m='742000'>MO theory can shed some light on this issue.</span>
  </p><p><span m='746000'>And then, the final two questions that I will fold into</span>
  <span m='750000'>one line here given the way I am using up space on this board is,</span>
  <span m='756000'>why is N two so stable --</span> <span m='765000'>-- and CO poison?</span>
  </p><p><span m='772000'>MO theory can shed very clear light on all of these questions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='775000'>And so, that is what we will work on for the rest of the</span>
  <span m='779000'>hour. In MO theory,</span> <span m='781000'>there are a couple
  things you should keep in mind when trying</span> <span m='785000'>to grasp all
  the subtleties of a given energy level diagram with</span> <span m='791000'>which
  you may be confronted in your textbook or on an exam or</span> <span m='795000'>just
  through reading papers in the Journal of the American</span> <span m='800000'>Chemical
  Society, wherever you may find these.</span> </p><p><span m='805000'>You should
  keep in mind that, number one, interaction is</span> <span m='811000'>strong. That
  is, when atomic orbitals</span> <span m='816000'>interact to form molecular orbitals,
  the AO interaction is</span> <span m='823000'>strong --</span> <span m='837000'>--
  when there is good spatial overlap.</span> </p><p><span m='851000'>Overlap is a
  central concept in molecular orbital theory.</span> </p><p><span m='855000'>The
  idea is that if you have atoms that are far apart from</span> <span m='859000'>each
  other in space, then their wave functions have</span> <span m='863000'>dropped off
  exponentially and are not interacting much and</span> <span m='867000'>there is
  not good overlap. But when orbitals are close in</span> <span m='872000'>space and
  if their orbitals are directed in space toward one</span> <span m='876000'>another,
  then there may be overlap that leads to good</span> <span m='880000'>bonding. And
  also I can echo this first</span> <span m='883000'>part, AO interaction is strong
  when, and say two,</span> <span m='887000'>AOs are close in energy. The interacting
  orbitals are</span> <span m='890000'>close in energy.</span> </p><p><span m='913000'>When
  I talk about where atomic orbitals are in energy,</span> <span m='917000'>I am going
  to really want you to think about your periodic</span> <span m='921000'>table and
  the properties that appear with periodicity and are</span> <span m='926000'>organized
  and collated in the periodic table.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>We are going
  to be talking about properties like</span> <span m='933000'>electronegativity as
  it relates to the energy.</span> </p><p><span m='937000'>And I will get to that
  a little bit on the next board,</span> <span m='942000'>but let's first make a small
  MO diagram here.</span> </p><p><span m='945000'>And this will be a diagram that
  we may use both for H two</span> <span m='951000'>or He two. This is the simplest
  of all MO</span> <span m='955000'>diagrams and one with which you should be quite
  familiar.</span> </p><p><span m='961000'>We have a bonding molecular orbital at
  low-end energy.</span> </p><p><span m='967000'>And notice that if this is a 1s orbital
  over here and this is a</span> <span m='974000'>1s orbital over here for H two or
  He two</span> <span m='980000'>systems, then when these come together and bond,</span>
  <span m='985000'>here are your two nuclei, --</span> <span m='990000'>-- and here
  is a probability density isosurface that I am</span> <span m='993000'>drawing around
  that shows in-phase combination of those</span> <span m='997000'>two 1s orbitals
  merging with each other, giving good overlap,</span> <span m='1002000'>and the interacting
  AOs being of the same energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1005000'>Because the H two
  and He two molecules have such</span> <span m='1009000'>symmetry we have a good
  bonding orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1012000'>And then, up here, we must find
  there to be an</span> <span m='1015000'>internuclear node in that corresponding
  antibonding</span> <span m='1019000'>orbital. And so, it will look something</span>
  <span m='1023000'>like this. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1025000'>I am going
  to associate with this high-lying orbital an</span> <span m='1030000'>asterisk to
  indicate the antibonding character,</span> <span m='1034000'>the presence of this
  internuclear node,</span> <span m='1038000'>the change of sign as we go from one
  nucleus to the other,</span> <span m='1043000'>the absence of bonding character.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1047000'>Here we have the buildup of electron density in the</span>
  <span m='1050000'>internuclear region, electrons being stabilized by</span> <span
  m='1054000'>being held simultaneously by more than one nucleus that is</span> <span
  m='1058000'>positively charged. And here, the exact inverse of</span> <span m='1062000'>that,
  constructive interference and destructive interference in</span> <span m='1067000'>the
  H two or He two systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1070000'>And then we can ask, how
  many electrons do we have</span> <span m='1074000'>to put into the diagram? If it
  is the H two case,</span> <span m='1080000'>then, to figure out the bond order,
  --</span> <span m='1094000'>-- what we do is populate the diagram according to the
  same</span> <span m='1098000'>kind of Aufbau principle that you would for generating
  the</span> <span m='1103000'>energy level diagram for an atom, and taking into account</span>
  <span m='1107000'>things like Hund's rule. If it is H two,</span> <span m='1112000'>we
  have two electrons that we can put in, which in here with</span> <span m='1117000'>opposing
  spin, like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1119000'>That is our bonding molecular orbital.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1123000'>We have two bonding electrons. Zero antibonding electrons</span>
  <span m='1128000'>divided by two equals a bond order of one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1132000'>We have an H-H single bond in the case of the H two</span> <span m='1137000'>molecule.
  But if we have He two,</span> <span m='1142000'>then in the He two system, we have
  two more electrons,</span> <span m='1147000'>and the only place they can go is up
  here in the antibonding</span> <span m='1152000'>molecular orbital. We have two
  bonding minus two</span> <span m='1156000'>antibonding over two is equal to zero
  for a bond order of zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1162000'>And so, the idea is that
  if two He atoms collide with each</span> <span m='1167000'>other, when they do so,
  their orbitals may overlap and</span> <span m='1171000'>give rise to bonding. But,
  simultaneously,</span> <span m='1176000'>you get antibonding. And the net bond order
  is zero,</span> <span m='1180000'>and so He two is not bound, but these atoms just</span>
  <span m='1184000'>bounce off each other. There is no stabilization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1187000'>And you can certainly understand that if we were in</span> <span m='1191000'>the
  middle somewhere, as we would be if we had He two</span> <span m='1195000'>plus,
  missing one electron up here,</span> <span m='1198000'>then our bond order would
  be one-half.</span> </p><p><span m='1202000'>It is going to get a lot more complicated
  than this,</span> <span m='1206000'>but this you have to know because this is a
  really nice</span> <span m='1211000'>starting point for thinking about bonding in
  all kinds of</span> <span m='1216000'>scenarios where you may need to consider it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1220000'>And so, let's look at some periodic properties.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1224000'>This will be with reference, again, to energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1230000'>And I am interested in how some of the properties of the atoms</span>
  <span m='1236000'>vary as we go across the periodic table,</span> <span m='1241000'>lithium
  to beryllium to boron to carbon to nitrogen to oxygen</span> <span m='1248000'>and
  over to fluorine. And I will stop there.</span> </p><p><span m='1252000'>We won't
  worry about any more of the noble gases today.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>As
  we go from left to right, one of the things that you know</span> <span m='1263000'>from
  your study of the periodic table is that electronegativity</span> <span m='1267000'>increases.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1281000'>This increases from left to right across the Periodic Table</span>
  <span m='1284000'>in concert with increasing Z.</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>That
  is, the increasing atomic number.</span> </p><p><span m='1296000'>That is, the increasing
  number of positively charged protons in</span> <span m='1301000'>our nucleus, as
  we go across. Each time we are adding more</span> <span m='1306000'>protons to that
  nucleus. The nucleus is becoming more</span> <span m='1310000'>and more positively
  charged as we go across.</span> </p><p><span m='1313000'>And an important consequence
  of that has to do with the fact</span> <span m='1318000'>that s orbitals don't have
  a node at the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='1323000'>Whereas, p orbitals do. Since
  these elements are in the</span> <span m='1328000'>so-called p block of our periodic
  table,</span> <span m='1332000'>well, lithium in the s block, but we will consider
  the</span> <span m='1338000'>properties all the way across. And the energy issue
  up here</span> <span m='1344000'>that I am going to be concerned with is the energy
  of the atomic</span> <span m='1349000'>2s versus 2p orbitals as we go from left
  to right across the</span> <span m='1353000'>periodic table, systematically adding
  to the</span> <span m='1357000'>number of protons in our nucleus in a way that does
  not affect 2s</span> <span m='1362000'>orbitals the same way that it affects 2p
  orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='1366000'>It turns out that by the time we get over
  to fluorine,</span> <span m='1370000'>where we have essentially our most electronegative
  element,</span> <span m='1375000'>the 2s orbital has sunk to a very low energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1380000'>And the 2p orbital has gone down in energy as well,</span>
  <span m='1385000'>but just not by nearly as much. And so, it is nearly an</span>
  <span m='1392000'>isotonic function as we go across.</span> </p><p><span m='1395000'>2p
  is decreasing in energy in response to this increased Z,</span> <span m='1402000'>but
  not as much as 2s is decreasing in energy,</span> <span m='1407000'>having to do
  with the fact that 2s electrons see much more of</span> <span m='1414000'>the nucleus
  than 2p electrons do because 2s electrons don't have</span> <span m='1421000'>a
  node there. They spend a lot more time in</span> <span m='1427000'>close to the
  nucleus than do your 2p electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='1432000'>This has a really
  important influence on that set of</span> <span m='1437000'>diatomic molecule MO
  theory problems, eight orbital</span> <span m='1442000'>problems, that we call homo
  or heteronuclear diatomic molecules</span> <span m='1449000'>of these elements.
  And that has to do with the</span> <span m='1454000'>fact that in between nitrogen
  and oxygen, a fundamental change</span> <span m='1460000'>takes place in the energy
  level diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='1464000'>And that change, that results from
  the atomic</span> <span m='1468000'>structure of the elements, ends up with the
  result that</span> <span m='1473000'>the MO diagram is much easier to draw for oxygen,</span>
  <span m='1478000'>O two, and fluorine,</span> <span m='1481000'>F two, than it is
  for the earlier</span> <span m='1485000'>ones. And it is much easier to</span> <span
  m='1488000'>understand for O two and F two than it is for N</span> <span m='1493000'>two,
  C two, B two, Be two, Li two.</span> </p><p><span m='1497000'>So, let's just see
  what that means.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>First of all, when we are going
  to draw an</span> <span m='1514000'>energy level diagram for a diatomic molecule,</span>
  <span m='1517000'>if it is a homonuclear diatomic molecule, meaning the two atoms</span>
  <span m='1523000'>that are going to be bonded together are the same,</span> <span
  m='1527000'>that means that the atomic orbitals for the contributing</span> <span
  m='1531000'>atoms are the same. Here, on the left,</span> <span m='1536000'>what
  I am drawing is, let's say, an F or an O atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1544000'>We
  have the 2s and the 2p, x-y-z.</span> </p><p><span m='1549000'>That is four of the
  eight orbitals in our problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1558000'>And then, over here,
  we have the other identical F</span> <span m='1563000'>or O atom, with its 2p x-y-z
  and 2s orbitals at exactly the same</span> <span m='1570000'>energy as for the counterpart,
  over here.</span> </p><p><span m='1575000'>So, this is another F or O atom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1578000'>And then we are going to ask, how can these atomic orbitals</span>
  <span m='1585000'>combine to give molecular orbitals in these diatomic</span> <span
  m='1591000'>molecules? This is unlike the BH three</span> <span m='1595000'>problem
  because there is no atom at the center of gravity</span> <span m='1600000'>of our
  system, but the ideas are the same.</span> </p><p><span m='1603000'>And the ideas
  are very much the same as what we have here for H</span> <span m='1607000'>two,
  where also we could make molecular orbitals despite</span> <span m='1611000'>the
  fact that there was no atom at the center of our system.</span> </p><p><span m='1616000'>We
  can pretend that there is, and we can use that pretend</span> <span m='1620000'>atom
  to identify what linear combinations we should make.</span> </p><p><span m='1625000'>A
  simpler way to do it, at this point,</span> <span m='1629000'>would be to say that
  our molecule has the two nuclei</span> <span m='1634000'>oriented along the z-axis.
  And then you have x and y</span> <span m='1640000'>perpendicular to z. And so, if
  we take this choice</span> <span m='1645000'>of coordinate system that the molecule
  is oriented along z,</span> <span m='1652000'>the two nuclei lie one on plus z,
  one on minus z.</span> </p><p><span m='1659000'>Then we can immediately classify
  our atomic orbitals as</span> <span m='1667000'>being either sigma or pi with respect
  to the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1675000'>I will say AO is sigma or pi with
  respect to z,</span> <span m='1682000'>which is the molecular axis. And remember
  what that means in</span> <span m='1690000'>terms of the nodal properties. If something
  is sigma with</span> <span m='1695000'>respect to z, that means if you view it down</span>
  <span m='1699000'>z it will look like a cylinder. It will look like a sphere,</span>
  <span m='1705000'>actually. It will be cylindrically</span> <span m='1708000'>symmetric
  about the z-axis. If it is sigma then,</span> <span m='1712000'>if you are viewing
  down z, you see that.</span> </p><p><span m='1717000'>That could be either an s
  orbital or it could be a pz</span> <span m='1723000'>orbital. They would look the
  same if you</span> <span m='1727000'>were viewing right down z. And then pi,</span>
  <span m='1732000'>viewing down z, would look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1736000'>And
  that would be a px or a py orbital perpendicular to the</span> <span m='1743000'>z-axis.
  And this would be an s orbital</span> <span m='1747000'>or a pz orbital. What I
  can say right away is</span> <span m='1751000'>that we can separate out the molecular
  orbitals that we are</span> <span m='1755000'>going to form from these atomic orbitals
  into their sigma or pi</span> <span m='1760000'>characteristics relative to the
  z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1764000'>And because we are in the O or F atom case,
  very far on the</span> <span m='1768000'>right-hand side the periodic table, we
  have a large gap.</span> </p><p><span m='1773000'>This gap is large.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1782000'>We can make the approximation that this 2s orbital here,</span> <span
  m='1787000'>which could in principle form a sigma bond with this 2pz orbital</span>
  <span m='1793000'>over here, that would be an interaction looking like that,</span>
  <span m='1799000'>-- -- that that does not occur.</span> </p><p><span m='1802000'>Because
  remember here I said you get strong interaction when</span> <span m='1807000'>the
  interacting AOs are close in energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1810000'>When you are
  talking about these very electronegative</span> <span m='1815000'>elements, the
  s manifold of orbitals is very well separated</span> <span m='1820000'>in energy
  from the p manifold. That leads to simplicity in the</span> <span m='1825000'>case
  of the diagram that we are about to draw.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>Because
  we say that this interacts with this in a sigma</span> <span m='1834000'>fashion,
  giving rise to bonding and antibonding interactions</span> <span m='1839000'>that
  look exactly like what we have drawn over there.</span> </p><p><span m='1843000'>I
  will draw the bonding orbital here.</span> </p><p><span m='1846000'>Actually, the
  antibonding orbital here and the bonding</span> <span m='1851000'>orbital here.
  And I will show the parentage</span> <span m='1854000'>of this molecular orbitals
  in this way.</span> </p><p><span m='1859000'>And you will recognize that this is
  our in-phase combination</span> <span m='1863000'>and this is our out-of-phase combination,
  analogous to the H</span> <span m='1868000'>two problem. This is like the H two</span>
  <span m='1872000'>problem built into the F two or the O two</span> <span m='1876000'>problem.
  And next what we find is that</span> <span m='1879000'>we can also make a sigma
  bond by interaction of pz with pz.</span> </p><p><span m='1884000'>This is going
  to be a nice strong directed bonding</span> <span m='1887000'>interaction that will
  look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1898000'>You see we have overlap here in
  the center, a nice strong</span> <span m='1902000'>bonding interaction in the center
  with 2pz orbitals that</span> <span m='1907000'>are directed at each other. And
  this is a sigma bond</span> <span m='1912000'>because you view that down z, it is
  going to look like a</span> <span m='1917000'>round thing. You are not going to
  see any</span> <span m='1922000'>nodal surfaces. And then it has up here a</span>
  <span m='1926000'>corresponding antibonding orbital right there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1931000'>So far I have --</span> <span m='1941000'>-- two pair-wise combinations
  that give us two sigma bonding</span> <span m='1947000'>orbitals and two sigma star
  antibonding orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='1954000'>So, that is pretty straightforward.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1957000'>And, once again, I can say that we have the H</span> <span
  m='1960000'>two problem built into this energy level diagram twice,</span> <span
  m='1966000'>with the s interactions, with the pz interactions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1970000'>The only thing I have left is to do my px and py interactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1976000'>And we can make a pair of pi bonds and a pair of pi</span>
  <span m='1980000'>anti-bonds that corresponds to those pi bonds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1986000'>This one is pi. This one is pi star.</span> </p><p><span m='1988000'>And
  what do they look like? Well, they look like</span> <span m='1992000'>side-to-side
  bonds between pairs of p orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='1996000'>This is just
  like what I showed you for the ethylene molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2001000'>The
  pi bond, in fact, has this nice overlap</span> <span m='2005000'>on one side and
  up here on the other.</span> </p><p><span m='2008000'>There is your pi bond. And
  you have one of those that</span> <span m='2013000'>lie in the x,z-plane and one
  of those that lie in the y,z-plane.</span> </p><p><span m='2018000'>You have two
  of them, and they are at equal energy</span> <span m='2023000'>here. And then up
  here,</span> <span m='2024000'>what does the pi star look like?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2027000'>Well, the same, except we turn around one of</span> <span m='2031000'>the
  p orbitals, introducing a nodal surface,</span> <span m='2034000'>like that. And
  we have two of those.</span> </p><p><span m='2039000'>And here is our nodal surface.
  Now it is an internuclear</span> <span m='2044000'>between the nuclei nodal surface,
  indicating antibonding</span> <span m='2049000'>character there. That is the easy
  case because s</span> <span m='2054000'>and p are very well separated. What you
  can see,</span> <span m='2058000'>though, is that type of interaction of a 2s on
  our left</span> <span m='2063000'>atom with a pz on the right atom, that might start
  to become</span> <span m='2069000'>important as you are over here in this part of
  the diagram,</span> <span m='2074000'>where s and p are pretty close together in
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2081000'>And that is what happens, in fact.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2083000'>And that is what happens as soon as you go to the left
  of</span> <span m='2088000'>oxygen and to nitrogen or anything lighter than nitrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2093000'>Suddenly, you cannot ignore interactions of s on one side</span>
  <span m='2097000'>with p on the other.</span> </p><p><span m='2109000'>And so, I
  am going to draw here the diagram that you would use,</span> <span m='2114000'>say,
  for N two. And, for simplicity,</span> <span m='2117000'>I am just going to draw
  the middle part.</span> </p><p><span m='2121000'>This part here in the middle is
  that which corresponds to the</span> <span m='2126000'>molecule. This one is what
  you would use</span> <span m='2129000'>for O two or F two.</span> </p><p><span m='2133000'>And
  let's just go ahead and draw that diagram for the</span> <span m='2139000'>molecule.
  This one would be this set of</span> <span m='2144000'>energy levels corresponding
  to, for example, N two.</span> </p><p><span m='2149000'>And we have increasing energy</span>
  <span m='2154000'>on the vertical axis. We are going to find that</span> <span m='2160000'>again,
  we have a sigma and a sigma star.</span> </p><p><span m='2167000'>And then, the
  difference comes right here where we find that as</span> <span m='2172000'>we go
  up in energy we next get to our pi bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='2177000'>And then,
  the next sigma orbital is slightly higher in</span> <span m='2182000'>energy than
  the pi system rather than slightly lower in energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2189000'>And
  then we will encounter up here our pi star.</span> </p><p><span m='2194000'>And
  then, finally, that highest in energy,</span> <span m='2198000'>sigma star. This
  switch,</span> <span m='2201000'>this sigma going up relative to that pi is really
  a consequence</span> <span m='2208000'>of all of the sigma orbitals being responsive
  to the value of</span> <span m='2215000'>the electronegativity of the 2s orbital
  of the atom.</span> </p><p><span m='2222000'>You can really almost consider the
  pi system independent from</span> <span m='2226000'>the sigma. These four sigma
  orbitals,</span> <span m='2229000'>sigma, sigma star, sigma, sigma star,</span>
  <span m='2232000'>I can call them one sigma, two, three, four,</span> <span m='2236000'>just
  to show you that we have, in ascending order,</span> <span m='2240000'>four orbitals
  of sigma symmetry.</span> </p><p><span m='2242000'>That whole manifold, when you
  can start mixing a</span> <span m='2246000'>little bit of very low energy s into
  it, sinks down relative to</span> <span m='2251000'>pi. In the case over here,</span>
  <span m='2254000'>we are basically pulling down the four sigma orbitals relative</span>
  <span m='2259000'>to pi. And here, because our s</span> <span m='2262000'>orbitals
  are higher in energy relative to our p orbitals,</span> <span m='2267000'>they go
  up a little bit and bumps three sigma up over pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2271000'>And
  what it means is that these orbitals are not so simple</span> <span m='2276000'>anymore.
  Any one of them is a linear</span> <span m='2279000'>combination of four atomic
  orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='2282000'>This orbital here, one sigma, will not
  look like</span> <span m='2286000'>it looks in the H two problem, anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2289000'>This one sigma will have some p mixed into it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2292000'>And so, one way we can represent that through a simple</span> <span
  m='2296000'>drawing is like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2305000'>You see the difference
  between that sigma bonding orbital and</span> <span m='2309000'>the one up there?
  We have some extra little nodes</span> <span m='2313000'>in here that are an inherent
  characteristic of the</span> <span m='2317000'>contribution of 2pz orbitals into
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2320000'>This is a linear combination of the 2s and
  the 2pz orbitals on</span> <span m='2325000'>the two atoms we have. There are four
  atomic orbitals</span> <span m='2329000'>that go in with different coefficients
  to these different</span> <span m='2334000'>parts of the sigma manifold. And then
  up here,</span> <span m='2337000'>the other bonding orbital, we can draw it this
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='2348000'>And this molecular orbital, this one here,</span>
  <span m='2351000'>three sigma, has diminished bonding</span> <span m='2354000'>character
  between the two nuclei and enhanced character on the</span> <span m='2360000'>outside,
  the part of the p orbital that is contributing to</span> <span m='2365000'>it that
  points away from the other atom.</span> </p><p><span m='2370000'>And so, while this
  has bonding character, it also has what we</span> <span m='2374000'>might think
  of as lone pair characteristics.</span> </p><p><span m='2377000'>In MO theory, some
  orbitals are not that</span> <span m='2380000'>simple. They might be at the same
  time</span> <span m='2382000'>a little bit bonding and a little bit lone pair in</span>
  <span m='2386000'>character. Let's look at a couple of</span> <span m='2389000'>orbitals
  like that, briefly.</span> </p><p><span m='2404000'>And here I have done this for
  the C two molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2408000'>I have done the calculation
  for C two,</span> <span m='2412000'>so now we are over here on the left-hand side
  of that dividing</span> <span m='2417000'>line where s and p are a big closer together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2420000'>And I am opening up this orbital, this one down here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2425000'>It is a little more complicated than the way I drew it
  on the</span> <span m='2430000'>board, but what you should be able to see is --</span>
  <span m='2435000'>Think back, now, to the first orbital I showed</span> <span m='2437000'>you
  today, which was the lowest lying orbital in the BH three</span> <span m='2441000'>molecule.
  You remember,</span> <span m='2443000'>no matter which way we turned it, we only
  saw blue,</span> <span m='2446000'>which was the positive wave function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2448000'>It looked like an s orbital, everywhere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2450000'>It had the same sign everywhere, and you could not</span> <span m='2453000'>see
  any nodal properties. Well, that would be true also</span> <span m='2456000'>for
  this one down here in the case of O two or F two</span> <span m='2460000'>because
  it is not mixing in p character.</span> </p><p><span m='2464000'>Because the atomic
  s and p orbitals are so far away in</span> <span m='2467000'>energy. But now, when
  they are closer</span> <span m='2469000'>in energy, this orbital down here, the
  s over here sees the p</span> <span m='2473000'>over here and they mix in, and vice
  versa.</span> </p><p><span m='2475000'>And, if I turn this around, what you are
  going to see are</span> <span m='2479000'>these little negative lobes here that
  I am indicating that are</span> <span m='2482000'>mixing in. But this is hugely
  bonding</span> <span m='2484000'>orbital, still, because look at how much of the</span>
  <span m='2487000'>orbital is centered in the region between the nuclei.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2492000'>This is a very strongly bonding orbital in this system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2497000'>Let's now visualize the three sigma, the third sigma symmetry</span>
  <span m='2504000'>orbital, as we ascend in energy. And it will look hopefully</span>
  <span m='2510000'>something like what I drew here. There it is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2524000'>You see this is a sigma orbital, because as we look down</span> <span
  m='2527000'>the z-axis, it looks just round. But it certainly has a lot of p</span>
  <span m='2531000'>orbital character because as we go from outside the molecule</span>
  <span m='2535000'>through the nucleus, we get a change in sign.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2538000'>And then there is overlap in here, but the amount of the</span> <span
  m='2541000'>overlap in here is small compared to the amount of this</span> <span
  m='2545000'>lobe out here that is just nonbonding in character because</span> <span
  m='2549000'>it is pointing out into space. It is like a lone pair of</span> <span
  m='2553000'>electrons at the same time as it is a bonding orbital.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2557000'>If this molecule actually had enough electrons to fill up</span> <span
  m='2561000'>through three sigma and no higher, than you would recognize</span> <span
  m='2566000'>that this orbital that we are looking at would be the highest</span>
  <span m='2570000'>occupied molecular orbital. And it would be responsible for</span>
  <span m='2575000'>the basicity and the nucleophilicity of the molecule</span> <span
  m='2578000'>-- -- because any Lewis acid that</span> <span m='2582000'>came in would
  want to come in on the z-axis to interact with this</span> <span m='2587000'>lone
  pair electron density out there.</span> </p><p><span m='2590000'>So, that is how
  our three sigma orbital now looks when we are on</span> <span m='2595000'>the left
  side of that red dotted line to the lighter elements.</span> </p><p><span m='2600000'>I
  will leave that up there for a moment while we consider a</span> <span m='2605000'>couple
  of interesting points. One of the things that you will</span> <span m='2610000'>often
  be asked to do is to write down the configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='2620000'>And
  I want to finish these two questions here of O two,</span> <span m='2625000'>why
  does it have unpaired electrons?</span> </p><p><span m='2629000'>In the case of
  O two, we are over on this diagram,</span> <span m='2634000'>we have 12 valance
  electrons. We can go two,</span> <span m='2638000'>four, six, eight, ten, and then
  11 and 12,</span> <span m='2642000'>two electrons up here in the pi star manifold.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2648000'>We are completely filled up through pi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2651000'>And then, we have a half-filled pi star with 12 electrons</span> <span
  m='2656000'>populating the O two diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='2659000'>Let's
  represent that this way. We have our one sigma with two</span> <span m='2664000'>electrons
  in. We have our second sigma,</span> <span m='2667000'>which is antibonding with
  two electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2672000'>Then we have our third sigma with
  two electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2676000'>And then, as we go up in energy,
  the next is our first pi</span> <span m='2680000'>orbital bonding. That accommodates
  four</span> <span m='2684000'>electrons. And then we have next our</span> <span
  m='2687000'>second pi type orbital. It is antibonding and has two</span> <span m='2691000'>electrons
  in it. And then all the other orbitals</span> <span m='2695000'>are empty, so I
  won't indicate them.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>This is the configuration for
  the O two molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2704000'>That means, we come back over
  here, by Hund's rule of maximum</span> <span m='2708000'>multiplicity, we have two
  spin-up electrons</span> <span m='2711000'>in the O two molecule with all these
  other orbitals</span> <span m='2716000'>down here being filled. That configuration
  that I wrote</span> <span m='2720000'>down for the O two molecule over there is
  a very shorthand way of</span> <span m='2724000'>representing the MO energy level
  diagram --</span> <span m='2729000'>-- because I started here at the lowest energy,</span>
  <span m='2732000'>and I went up in energy like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2735000'>And
  what you can see is sigma star cancels sigma,</span> <span m='2738000'>so no bonding
  there. We have here three electron</span> <span m='2742000'>pairs in bonding orbitals,
  sigma and 2pi,</span> <span m='2745000'>but we have two electrons that are unpaired
  electrons,</span> <span m='2749000'>responsible for the paramagnetism of the O two</span>
  <span m='2753000'>molecule, that cancel some of the bonding</span> <span m='2756000'>down
  here. When we want to write that down</span> <span m='2761000'>in terms of our bond
  order convention, we have six bonding</span> <span m='2764000'>electrons minus two
  antibonding electrons over two,</span> <span m='2768000'>which is going to be equal
  to a bond order of two.</span> </p><p><span m='2771000'>That is our bond order for
  O two.</span> </p><p><span m='2774000'>While the bond order is what we expect to
  find based on that</span> <span m='2778000'>valance bond representation of O two
  up there,</span> <span m='2781000'>what we find out is that the representation of
  O two up there</span> <span m='2785000'>in the valance bond terminology would not
  tell us that the</span> <span m='2789000'>molecule should actually have two electrons
  that are not</span> <span m='2792000'>paired in the molecule, --</span> <span m='2796000'>--
  that it should have paramagnetism due to the lack of</span> <span m='2799000'>pairing
  up of all the electrons, spin pairing in the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2802000'>And
  it has to do with this high symmetry of the O two molecule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2806000'>And it cannot distort from high</span> <span m='2808000'>symmetry because
  it has just two atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='2811000'>It has very few degrees of
  freedom.</span> </p><p><span m='2813000'>It cannot bend or something to get those
  electrons to pair up,</span> <span m='2816000'>and so they are unpaired. And that
  is why dioxegen has</span> <span m='2821000'>unpaired electrons. And then, if we
  go to nitrogen,</span> <span m='2824000'>the order that we write these things down
  in is a little</span> <span m='2829000'>different because the energy level diagram
  is different</span> <span m='2833000'>because now s and p are closer together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2836000'>And what we have is one sigma with two electrons,</span>
  <span m='2839000'>or two sigma star with two electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2842000'>And
  then, next, we have our one pi with its</span> <span m='2845000'>four electrons.
  And then next,</span> <span m='2849000'>we have our three sigma with its two electrons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2852000'>And that is it. We have two less electrons in</span> <span
  m='2855000'>the system than we do in O two.</span> </p><p><span m='2858000'>That
  is N two. And our bond order now is</span> <span m='2861000'>three. That is in accord
  with our</span> <span m='2863000'>Lewis structure of N two, but it is a triple bond.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2868000'>And it is a triple bond in a molecule that is completely</span>
  <span m='2872000'>non-polar. And it is one of the strongest</span> <span m='2874000'>chemical
  bonds known. That triple bond is worth about</span> <span m='2878000'>226 kilocalories
  per mole. And it makes N two a</span> <span m='2883000'>very fascinating molecule.
  And, of course,</span> <span m='2886000'>it is the major constituent of our atmosphere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2889000'>And it is very inert, due to the stability associated</span>
  <span m='2893000'>with having this diagram populated up all through the</span> <span
  m='2896000'>bonding orbitals, and then no more antibonding</span> <span m='2899000'>electrons
  present in the system. So, that is pretty interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='2903000'>And
  given the time, I think I will leave you after</span> <span m='2907000'>the following.
  I just want to show you one</span> <span m='2911000'>more picture as a prelude to
  where I will start next time.</span> </p><p><span m='2916000'>And that has to do
  with what happens when the two atoms that</span> <span m='2921000'>are bonding are
  different. Let's look at the three sigma</span> <span m='2925000'>orbital for the
  carbon monoxide molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2929000'>It would look like it
  does for N two.</span> </p><p><span m='2932000'>It is the same number of electrons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2935000'>But look here. It is very asymmetric.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2940000'>And that has to do with the fact that carbon and oxygen have</span>
  <span m='2944000'>very different electronegativity.</span> </p><p><span m='2946000'>And
  so, this highest occupied molecular orbital for carbon</span> <span m='2950000'>monoxide,
  again, an eight orbital problem,</span> <span m='2953000'>and again, a ten electron
  system, is one where we have a</span> <span m='2956000'>larger coefficient on the
  lone pair piece that is on the carbon</span> <span m='2961000'>atom of the molecule.
  And I will start off with this</span> <span m='2964000'>next time, but that is one
  of two reasons why CO is a poison.</span> </p><p><span m='2970000'>Have a nice weekend.</span>
