  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Last time we started
  talking about the internal motions of</span> <span m='20000'>molecules, the vibrations
  and the rotations.</span> </p><p><span m='24000'>And we talked about how the different
  ways in which a</span> <span m='30000'>molecule can store energy were called modes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='35000'>Or, sometimes called the degrees of freedom.</span> </p><p><span
  m='41000'>And so, in general, if we have a molecule that has</span> <span m='48000'>N
  atoms, it has 3N degrees of freedom or 3N modes.</span> </p><p><span m='55000'>And
  we said last time, that three of those 3N modes</span> <span m='62000'>are always
  translational modes. We live in a three-dimensional</span> <span m='71000'>universe,
  so there are three translational modes,</span> <span m='76000'>three directions
  in which the molecule can travel,</span> <span m='81000'>can move. And, therefore,</span>
  <span m='84000'>if we use three of these 3N modes for translation,</span> <span
  m='89000'>then we have 3 minus 3 modes that are internal modes,</span> <span m='94000'>internal
  degrees of freedom. And that is what we really want</span> <span m='102000'>to start
  looking at today. On the diagram here,</span> <span m='107000'>on the side, here
  is our N molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='111000'>There are 3N total modes. I just
  said three of them were</span> <span m='117000'>translational modes. Now, how do
  we separate those</span> <span m='122000'>remaining modes between rotation and vibration?</span>
  </p><p><span m='127000'>The way we do it this. If you have a molecule that is</span>
  <span m='132000'>linear, you always have two rotational modes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136000'>I will show you that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='139000'>Linear
  molecules always have two rotational modes.</span> </p><p><span m='144000'>Nonlinear
  molecules have three rotational modes.</span> </p><p><span m='150000'>Therefore,
  if we use, in a linear molecule,</span> <span m='154000'>three of them for translation,
  two of them for rotation,</span> <span m='160000'>the number of vibrational modes
  are what is left over.</span> </p><p><span m='166000'>For a linear molecule, we
  have 3N minus 5 vibrational</span> <span m='171000'>modes. If we have a nonlinear</span>
  <span m='176000'>molecule, since we have three rotational modes in a nonlinear</span>
  <span m='182000'>molecule, we have leftover 3N minus 6 vibrational</span> <span
  m='188000'>modes.</span> </p><p><span m='196000'>Now, let's take a look at this
  a little bit more in detail.</span> </p><p><span m='201000'>Let's start with nitrogen.
  Two atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='205000'>Six modes total. Three translational.</span>
  </p><p><span m='209000'>Two rotational modes of nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='213000'>What
  are those rotational modes?</span> </p><p><span m='215000'>Well, here is our nitrogen.
  And one of those rotational</span> <span m='219000'>modes is going to be rotation
  about an axis in the plane of</span> <span m='224000'>this board, and its rotation
  around this axis.</span> </p><p><span m='227000'>That axis goes through the center
  of mass of that molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='232000'>That is one of the rotational
  modes.</span> </p><p><span m='236000'>Another rotational mode is rotation around
  an axis,</span> <span m='240000'>here, that is perpendicular to the board.</span>
  </p><p><span m='243000'>This is another rotational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='246000'>It
  is going to turn out that these two rotational modes are</span> <span m='251000'>degenerate,
  meaning they are going to have the same frequency</span> <span m='257000'>of rotation.
  They are going to have the same</span> <span m='261000'>energy. We will talk about
  that in a</span> <span m='264000'>moment. What I want to point out,</span> <span
  m='268000'>here, is that if you look at the axis, here,</span> <span m='273000'>in
  the plane of the board that is along the bond axis,</span> <span m='278000'>this,
  hey, you know what, this is not a rotational mode</span> <span m='284000'>because
  there is cylindrical symmetry around that bond axis.</span> </p><p><span m='290000'>It
  has no meaning, rotation around that bond axis.</span> </p><p><span m='295000'>The
  molecule looks the same for all of the angles from zero to</span> <span m='301000'>360
  degrees. That is not a rotational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='306000'>Linear molecules,
  diatomics, you have two</span> <span m='310000'>rotational modes. They are going
  to turn out to</span> <span m='314000'>be degenerate, as we are going to see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='318000'>And then, our table over there says for nitrogen,</span>
  <span m='322000'>we ought to have one vibrational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='326000'>And
  we do. That one vibrational mode,</span> <span m='330000'>here, is the nitrogen-nitrogen
  stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='333000'>It is a stretch mode. We said last time
  that these</span> <span m='338000'>bonds function like a spring. The molecule can
  stretch,</span> <span m='343000'>the molecule can compress. We are going to look
  at that in</span> <span m='348000'>more detail in just a moment. Next, in our table
  over here,</span> <span m='354000'>let's look at CO two. CO two has three atoms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='359000'>Nine total modes. Three of them are translation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='365000'>CO two, even though it has three atoms</span> <span m='369000'>in
  it, is a linear molecule, so it has only two rotational</span> <span m='374000'>modes.
  Let's look and see what those</span> <span m='377000'>two rotational modes are.
  One of those rotational modes</span> <span m='382000'>is, again, rotation around
  an axis in the plane of the board,</span> <span m='388000'>here, around the center
  of mass of that molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='394000'>That is one rotational
  mode. The other rotational mode is</span> <span m='399000'>around an axis perpendicular
  to the board here.</span> </p><p><span m='404000'>That is a second rotational mode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='407000'>These two modes are going to be degenerate because they
  are</span> <span m='413000'>actually the same motion, just in a different plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='420000'>These are degenerate. And then, again,</span> <span m='423000'>just
  to emphasize, if you think that you have a</span> <span m='428000'>rotation here
  along that linear bond axis, well,</span> <span m='433000'>the answer is no, this
  is not a rotational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='438000'>So, we have two rotational
  modes for CO two.</span> </p><p><span m='443000'>And now what does our table say
  in terms of vibration?</span> </p><p><span m='450000'>Well, in terms of vibration
  for a linear molecule,</span> <span m='455000'>3N minus 5, we have used now five
  modes.</span> </p><p><span m='460000'>We have four left, 3N minus 5.</span> </p><p><span
  m='465000'>What are those modes?</span> </p><p><span m='474000'>One of these modes
  is what we call a symmetric stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='488000'>A symmetric
  stretch means that this oxygen and this oxygen are</span> <span m='494000'>simultaneously
  stretching or are simultaneously compressing.</span> </p><p><span m='500000'>My
  body is the carbon, and my arms are the oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='506000'>A
  symmetric stretch is the oxygens both moving in or both</span> <span m='511000'>moving
  out. That is one vibrational mode,</span> <span m='516000'>this symmetric stretch.
  That is one vibrational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='521000'>What is another vibrational
  mode?</span> </p><p><span m='524000'>Well, if you have a symmetric stretch, it must
  mean you have</span> <span m='529000'>an anti-symmetric stretch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='538000'>In this case, we have one oxygen moving out</span> <span m='541000'>while
  the other oxygen is moving in.</span> </p><p><span m='543000'>And this carbon is
  kind of moving in like that,</span> <span m='547000'>too. Or, this one is moving
  in,</span> <span m='549000'>this one is moving in, this one is moving out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='552000'>That is the anti-symmetric stretch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='555000'>If my body is the carbon and my arms are the oxygen,</span> <span m='558000'>this
  is the anti-symmetric stretch with the carbon moving</span> <span m='563000'>just
  a little bit to the side, too.</span> </p><p><span m='565000'>The anti-symmetric
  stretch, another mode.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>These two modes are not degenerate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='572000'>They have different frequencies.</span> </p><p><span m='574000'>They
  have different energies. We will see that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='593000'>What
  are the other modes? Well, the other modes are a</span> <span m='598000'>bending
  mode. What can happen is that this</span> <span m='602000'>oxygen and this oxygen
  can move in, and this carbon will kind of</span> <span m='607000'>move out. Or,
  of course,</span> <span m='609000'>the other way, here.</span> </p><p><span m='611000'>These
  go like that, this goes like that,</span> <span m='614000'>or that goes like that.
  This is a bending vibration.</span> </p><p><span m='625000'>Again, if my body is
  the carbon and these are the oxygens,</span> <span m='632000'>the bending vibration
  looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='637000'>That is the bending vibration. However,
  you could also imagine</span> <span m='643000'>that you have a bend in another plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='648000'>In other words, you can imagine that these two</span> <span
  m='653000'>oxygens here are coming out at you or going in at you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='660000'>And so, in other words, if I am the carbon,</span> <span m='664000'>these
  are the oxygens. We also have a bend like this.</span> </p><p><span m='670000'>These
  two bending vibrations are degenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='674000'>These are
  four different vibrations.</span> </p><p><span m='678000'>They are the four vibrational
  modes, two bending,</span> <span m='683000'>one symmetric stretch, and the other,</span>
  <span m='687000'>the anti-symmetric stretch. That is what we have in</span> <span
  m='694000'>CO two. What about another molecule?</span> </p><p><span m='698000'>How
  about water? We have three atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='701000'>Again, nine total
  modes. Three of them are translation,</span> <span m='707000'>but now water is not
  a linear molecular.</span> </p><p><span m='710000'>So, we are going to have three
  rotational modes in the case of</span> <span m='716000'>water. Let's look at what
  those three</span> <span m='720000'>rotational modes ought to look like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='732000'>Here is our water molecule. One of those rotations is,</span>
  <span m='738000'>again, a rotation around an axis here in the plane of the</span>
  <span m='744000'>board. That is one rotational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='749000'>If
  I am the oxygen and my hands are the hydrogen,</span> <span m='753000'>this is a
  rotational mode. You got that?</span> </p><p><span m='757000'>Okay. And then another
  rotational</span> <span m='760000'>mode, here. It can be a rotation around the</span>
  <span m='764000'>center of the mass, centered on the oxygen here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='768000'>Axis perpendicular to the plane of the board.</span> </p><p><span m='772000'>This
  is that rotation. And I am sorry,</span> <span m='776000'>but I cannot do cartwheels.
  That is one rotational mode.</span> </p><p><span m='782000'>And then a final rotational
  mode involves rotation,</span> <span m='787000'>now, around this axis. It is an
  axis perpendicular to</span> <span m='793000'>this one, but in the plane of the
  board.</span> </p><p><span m='796000'>And this is a rotational mode. We have three
  rotational modes.</span> </p><p><span m='803000'>This one requires me to do some
  flips, which I am also not going</span> <span m='809000'>to do. But each one of
  these modes has</span> <span m='813000'>a different frequency, has a different energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='817000'>And you can see we have three of them now because we no
  longer</span> <span m='822000'>have a linear molecule. We have three rotational
  modes.</span> </p><p><span m='826000'>Now, what about the vibrations for water?</span>
  </p><p><span m='830000'>Well, you can see from our graph up here that 3N minus 6,</span>
  <span m='834000'>in this case for water, is going to be three</span> <span m='839000'>vibrational
  modes. Let's look at that.</span> </p><p><span m='859000'>One of those vibrational
  modes is a symmetric stretch,</span> <span m='865000'>again. The hydrogen is moving
  in or</span> <span m='870000'>both moving out at the same time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='875000'>A picture of the symmetric stretch is, again,</span> <span m='879000'>I
  am the oxygen, arms are the hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='883000'>This is the
  symmetric stretch, right?</span> </p><p><span m='886000'>And then, if there is a
  symmetric stretch,</span> <span m='890000'>there is going to be an anti-symmetric
  stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='895000'>What that means is one of the hydrogens
  is moving in and the</span> <span m='900000'>other one moving out. Or, this way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='906000'>Of course, a picture for that is this kind of a motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='915000'>You get the idea. Anti-symmetric stretch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='922000'>And then, finally, we have a bending mode.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>A
  bending mode, meaning these hydrogens moving</span> <span m='935000'>this way or
  those hydrogens moving that way.</span> </p><p><span m='940000'>And, of course,
  a picture for that is this.</span> </p><p><span m='946000'>That is a bending mode
  for the hydrogens.</span> </p><p><span m='950000'>We have three vibrational modes
  for the hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='958000'>Now we are going to look at some
  of the principles behind</span> <span m='962000'>these internal degrees of freedom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='964000'>But, of course, the other reason for telling</span> <span
  m='968000'>you about this-- Did you have a question?</span> </p><p><span m='977000'>It
  can, but it is not a separate mode.</span> </p><p><span m='980000'>That is correct.
  That is right.</span> </p><p><span m='983000'>It looks like a rotation, actually.</span>
  </p><p><span m='986000'>That is absolutely correct. The other reason for talking</span>
  <span m='992000'>about this is to tell you that each one of these vibrations or</span>
  <span m='997000'>rotations occurs at a frequency at an energy that is</span> <span
  m='1001000'>characteristic of the molecule. If we had a way to actually</span> <span
  m='1005000'>measure the frequency of these vibrations or the frequencies of</span>
  <span m='1010000'>the rotations, well, then we have a great tool</span> <span m='1014000'>for
  identifying what kind of molecule we have.</span> </p><p><span m='1019000'>Analytically,
  this is a wonderful technique</span> <span m='1022000'>for identifying, ultimately,
  the molecule that</span> <span m='1026000'>you have, if you can measure those frequencies
  of vibration</span> <span m='1031000'>or rotation. And we are going to do that in</span>
  <span m='1035000'>just a moment. But what we also have to</span> <span m='1038000'>understand,
  before we go and measure these frequencies,</span> <span m='1043000'>is we have
  to understand that the energies with which a</span> <span m='1048000'>molecule vibrates
  or rotates are quantized.</span> </p><p><span m='1053000'>So, that is what we have
  to spend some time thinking about</span> <span m='1057000'>right now. Let's do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1071000'>And we are going to start with vibration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1080000'>To illustrate this, I am going to draw one of these</span> <span m='1084000'>energies
  of interaction, again, one of these curves that</span> <span m='1089000'>we have
  been talking about. And I am going to set my zero</span> <span m='1094000'>of energy
  at the dissociated atom limit.</span> </p><p><span m='1098000'>So, I am going to
  talk about H plus Cl.</span> </p><p><span m='1101000'>And, of course, right here,
  we talked about</span> <span m='1105000'>this being the equilibrium bond length,
  r sub e,</span> <span m='1109000'>for the HCl molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1119000'>That
  is the energy of interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1122000'>I am going to now
  draw in the ground vibrational state of HCl,</span> <span m='1129000'>which I am
  going to represent as a line.</span> </p><p><span m='1133000'>It is going to be
  the energy. There is the ground vibrational</span> <span m='1139000'>state of HCl.
  The ground vibrational state,</span> <span m='1144000'>that energy is characterized
  by a quantum number.</span> </p><p><span m='1149000'>The quantum number is the vibrational
  quantum number for</span> <span m='1155000'>the ground vibrational state. The vibrational
  quantum number</span> <span m='1160000'>is v equal zero. What this line represents
  is</span> <span m='1166000'>the ground vibrational energy. It also represents the
  extent</span> <span m='1172000'>to which the molecule's bond stretches and compresses.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1178000'>The bottom line, here, is that the bond</span> <span m='1182000'>stretches
  up to here. The inner section of this line</span> <span m='1187000'>with the interaction
  energy, here, represents the maximum</span> <span m='1192000'>distance of the bond,
  the maximum bond length,</span> <span m='1197000'>the most that the bond stretches.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1202000'>r is going this way. The intersection of this energy</span>
  <span m='1207000'>with this curve represents the closest that the two nuclei get.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1214000'>This represents the most that the molecule has compressed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1221000'>This is the smallest value of r.</span> </p><p><span m='1224000'>That
  is what that diagram represents.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>If you start out,
  here, with an HCl molecule at</span> <span m='1234000'>the equilibrium bond length,
  right here, what happens is</span> <span m='1240000'>that the HCl will stretch,
  and it will stretch to this</span> <span m='1245000'>position. This is an exaggeration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1248000'>This is how much it stretches. And then, it comes back
  and</span> <span m='1254000'>goes through the equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1259000'>Over here, and this is another exaggeration,</span> <span m='1262000'>this
  is how close they get to each other.</span> </p><p><span m='1266000'>This is how
  much they compress. This point is often called the</span> <span m='1271000'>inner
  turning point, inner because it is the</span> <span m='1275000'>smallest bond distance.
  This is often called the outer</span> <span m='1279000'>turning point because it
  is the larger bond distance.</span> </p><p><span m='1284000'>It is outer because
  it is at this distance,</span> <span m='1288000'>now, that the bond turns around
  and begins to compress.</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>This HCl molecule here is
  vibrating, equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span m='1299000'>Then it goes to
  the maximum extension, comes back through</span> <span m='1304000'>the equilibrium
  position, and then goes to the maximum</span> <span m='1309000'>compression, comes
  back to the equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span m='1314000'>That is what this
  line literally represents.</span> </p><p><span m='1319000'>It is also the energy,
  which I will explain a little</span> <span m='1323000'>bit more in just a moment.
  So, this molecule is vibrating</span> <span m='1328000'>from here to here to here
  and back and forth.</span> </p><p><span m='1332000'>Now, what I also want to point
  out to you is something that I</span> <span m='1338000'>have been kind of misleading
  you about for the last few weeks.</span> </p><p><span m='1343000'>That is that this
  molecule is not sitting in the bottom of</span> <span m='1348000'>this well. Remember
  that when we were</span> <span m='1353000'>drawing bond association energies, I
  was drawing it from</span> <span m='1359000'>the bottom of this well to the dissociated
  atom limit?</span> </p><p><span m='1364000'>I told you this was delta E sub d.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1369000'>Well, the bottom line is that it is not really correct.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1374000'>The reason is, is because the molecule is</span> <span
  m='1379000'>never really sitting at the bottom of this well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1385000'>It is sitting this much above. It is sitting at the v equal</span> <span
  m='1390000'>zero state. It is not sitting at the bottom</span> <span m='1395000'>of
  the well. If it were, it would not be</span> <span m='1399000'>vibrating. If it
  is not vibration,</span> <span m='1402000'>it will violate the Uncertainty Principle,
  something we didn't</span> <span m='1408000'>talk about. But the bottom line is
  that it</span> <span m='1413000'>cannot sit at the bottom of the well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1417000'>It is always vibrating by about this much energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1422000'>When you have an experimentally determined dissociation energy</span>
  <span m='1428000'>for the bond energy, the experimentally determined</span> <span
  m='1434000'>energy is actually the energy from this level.</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>From
  v equal zero up to this dissociation limit.</span> </p><p><span m='1445000'>This
  is the experimental bond energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1449000'>Because, if you
  are going to measure a bond energy in the</span> <span m='1454000'>laboratory, well,
  you can only measure it from</span> <span m='1458000'>the lowest level at which
  that molecule can possibly be at.</span> </p><p><span m='1464000'>It is not at the
  bottom of the well.</span> </p><p><span m='1469000'>The difference between where
  this level is and the bottom of</span> <span m='1474000'>the well actually has a
  name. That difference is called the</span> <span m='1479000'>zero point energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1487000'>And I will explain that in a moment, when we look at the</span>
  <span m='1492000'>energies a little more carefully.</span> </p><p><span m='1495000'>Now,
  just for completeness, and this is not something that</span> <span m='1500000'>you
  have to know, let me tell you what the</span> <span m='1504000'>nomenclature usually
  is here for these well depths.</span> </p><p><span m='1510000'>The nomenclature
  from the bottom of the well to here,</span> <span m='1514000'>which is not experimentally
  measured, is usually D sub e,</span> <span m='1518000'>dissociation sub e.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1528000'>From the v equal zero level to the dissociation limit,</span>
  <span m='1533000'>that energy here is D sub zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1537000'>You
  don't have to know these, but I just want to tell you,</span> <span m='1542000'>when
  you see that. All dissociation energies</span> <span m='1546000'>experimentally
  measured are measured from here to here</span> <span m='1551000'>because that is
  the lowest energy the molecule can have,</span> <span m='1556000'>is being in the
  v equal zero ground vibrational</span> <span m='1561000'>state. Well, now let's
  take a look at</span> <span m='1567000'>the energies a little more carefully.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1591000'>Here is our favorite diagram again, our intermolecular</span>
  <span m='1597000'>interaction potential. This is HCl,</span> <span m='1601000'>so
  here is the dissociated atom limit.</span> </p><p><span m='1605000'>This is v equal
  zero, right in there.</span> </p><p><span m='1611000'>Now, there is an excited state
  for the HCl, or for any</span> <span m='1617000'>molecule. v equal one is the first</span>
  <span m='1622000'>vibrationally excited state. v equal two is the</span> <span m='1628000'>second
  vibrationally excited state.</span> </p><p><span m='1631000'>v equal three is the
  third.</span> </p><p><span m='1635000'>v equal four is the fourth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1638000'>v equal five is the fifth.</span> </p><p><span m='1642000'>These are
  the allowed vibrational energies.</span> </p><p><span m='1648000'>In other words,
  the molecule can vibrate with</span> <span m='1652000'>this energy or this energy
  or this energy, but not some</span> <span m='1658000'>arbitrary energy, like right
  in here or like</span> <span m='1663000'>right in there. These are the allowed</span>
  <span m='1667000'>vibrational states. And we have a nice analytical</span> <span
  m='1672000'>expression to describe those energies.</span> </p><p><span m='1676000'>That
  analytical expression is right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1682000'>That energy
  is h times nu times (that vibrational quantum number</span> <span m='1687000'>plus
  one-half).</span> </p><p><span m='1690000'>So, v is that vibrational quantum number.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1693000'>This nu, here, is the fundamental frequency,</span> <span
  m='1697000'>which is the frequency with which the molecule vibrates.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1702000'>It is the frequency with which that molecule stretches,</span> <span
  m='1706000'>comes back to the equilibrium position, compresses,</span> <span m='1711000'>and
  comes back to the equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span m='1716000'>It is the
  number of cycles per second that molecule makes.</span> </p><p><span m='1721000'>So,
  nu is the number of cycles, here, that the molecule in v</span> <span m='1727000'>equal
  zero makes per second.</span> </p><p><span m='1730000'>Stretches, compresses, and
  back to the equilibrium</span> <span m='1735000'>position. Notice it is also the</span>
  <span m='1738000'>vibrational frequency of v equal one.</span> </p><p><span m='1744000'>The
  vibrational frequency does not depend on the vibrational</span> <span m='1749000'>quantum
  number. You see no dependence of the</span> <span m='1752000'>vibrational quantum
  number on the frequency.</span> </p><p><span m='1756000'>v equal two vibrates with
  the same frequency.</span> </p><p><span m='1761000'>v equal three. v equal four.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1763000'>v equal five. All of these states have the</span> <span
  m='1767000'>same nu here, have the same fundamental</span> <span m='1770000'>frequency.
  What does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='1774000'>That looks a little strange
  in the sense that if you have a</span> <span m='1779000'>molecule in v equals zero,
  the number of cycles per second</span> <span m='1783000'>that it makes is the same
  as a molecule in v equal five.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>Well, you can see
  that in v equal five, the molecule has to</span> <span m='1792000'>stretch further,
  and it has to compress further.</span> </p><p><span m='1796000'>It has to travel
  more distance. And so, if it has to travel</span> <span m='1802000'>more distance,
  but it still carries out the</span> <span m='1806000'>number of cycles per unit
  time, the same as v equal zero,</span> <span m='1811000'>well, then it must mean
  that the molecule in v equal five is</span> <span m='1817000'>moving more quickly,
  is moving faster.</span> </p><p><span m='1821000'>And that is what that means. The
  energy of this state is</span> <span m='1826000'>higher. It is moving faster.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1830000'>But it is moving with the same frequency nu.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1834000'>That is the fundamental frequency.</span> </p><p><span m='1837000'>That
  fundamental frequency, of course, is in hertz,</span> <span m='1842000'>our unit
  for all frequencies here.</span> </p><p><span m='1845000'>Now, I drew on the board
  and called this energy from the</span> <span m='1851000'>bottom of the well to v
  equal zero, the zero point energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1856000'>That is what
  it is. But numerically what that</span> <span m='1861000'>energy is, is one-half
  h nu. Stick in v equal zero,</span> <span m='1865000'>you get one-half h nu.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1868000'>This energy, here, is measured from the</span> <span m='1871000'>bottom
  of this well. It is important that you</span> <span m='1875000'>understand where
  this energy is measured from.</span> </p><p><span m='1878000'>It is measured from
  the bottom of this well.</span> </p><p><span m='1882000'>v equal one, you put that
  in here and get</span> <span m='1885000'>three-halves h nu.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1889000'>v equal two, you get five-halves h nu.</span> </p><p><span m='1893000'>v
  equal three,</span> <span m='1895000'>you get seven-halves h nu.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1900000'>The other thing to notice is that these states are equally</span> <span
  m='1905000'>spaced. The energy spacing between any</span> <span m='1909000'>two
  adjacent states is h times nu.</span> </p><p><span m='1922000'>That is incorrect.
  What I am drawing,</span> <span m='1925000'>here, is right. I am sorry about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1929000'>One-half h nu is from the bottom of the well to v</span>
  <span m='1936000'>equal zero. I think I know what happened.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1940000'>What I have shown you here is correct.</span> </p><p><span m='1944000'>What
  is in your notes is printed incorrectly.</span> </p><p><span m='1950000'>You should
  make note of that and change that.</span> </p><p><span m='1965000'>Suppose we have
  a molecule in the v equal zero state,</span> <span m='1969000'>where the energy
  is one-half h nu,</span> <span m='1974000'>that molecule can be excited to the v
  equal one state.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>That molecule in v equal zero is
  still vibrating,</span> <span m='1984000'>but we can make it vibrate even faster,
  with more energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1989000'>The same cycles per second, but
  with more energy,</span> <span m='1993000'>by promoting it to v equal one. We can
  do that if the molecule</span> <span m='1999000'>absorbs a photon. And the energy
  of that photon</span> <span m='2003000'>has to be equal to the difference in the
  energies of</span> <span m='2008000'>these two states. So, if the final energy,</span>
  <span m='2013000'>here, of the v equal one state, that is the final state,</span>
  <span m='2017000'>if that energy is three-halves h nu and the energy</span> <span
  m='2023000'>of the initial state was one-half h nu,</span> <span m='2027000'>then
  the difference in energy between the states is h nu.</span> </p><p><span m='2032000'>We
  have to have a photon that has exactly this energy</span> <span m='2036000'>different,
  delta E. That delta E,</span> <span m='2039000'>then, has to be gotten by a photon
  with a frequency equal to</span> <span m='2044000'>nu. And the frequency of that</span>
  <span m='2047000'>photon that is going to make that transition is actually also</span>
  <span m='2052000'>the fundamental frequency of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2055000'>We are lucky on this one. Nu is delta E over h.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2059000'>We have to have a photon with</span> <span m='2063000'>that frequency
  for the molecule to be promoted from v equal zero</span> <span m='2068000'>to v
  equal one. How do we know what that is?</span> </p><p><span m='2073000'>Well, we
  do an experiment. We do an infrared spectroscopy</span> <span m='2079000'>type of
  experiment. The difference in the energies</span> <span m='2084000'>between vibrational
  states is in the infrared range of the</span> <span m='2091000'>electromagnetic
  spectrum. And so we are going to use</span> <span m='2096000'>infrared radiation.
  We have some source of infrared</span> <span m='2102000'>radiation. It puts out
  all different</span> <span m='2105000'>frequencies in the infrared. And then we
  send it through a</span> <span m='2109000'>monochromator. The monochromator disperses</span>
  <span m='2113000'>that radiation in space and allows only a certain frequency</span>
  <span m='2117000'>of radiation to come right through the slits and out into</span>
  <span m='2122000'>our sample. It is like you had the</span> <span m='2124000'>diffraction
  glasses, where we disbursed the</span> <span m='2128000'>radiation in space. Well,
  a monochromator is</span> <span m='2132000'>essentially the same thing. There is
  a diffraction grading</span> <span m='2136000'>in it. It allows, out of the front</span>
  <span m='2139000'>end, only radiation of a certain frequency to come out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2142000'>And we can adjust what that radiation is or what frequency</span>
  <span m='2146000'>that radiation has. We then allow it to pass</span> <span m='2149000'>through
  our sample, say HCl.</span> </p><p><span m='2151000'>And then there is photo detector
  over here,</span> <span m='2154000'>some kind of photomultiplier. And what will
  happen is that if</span> <span m='2160000'>this molecule is going to absorb frequency
  of that radiation,</span> <span m='2165000'>well, then the number of photons reaching
  the photo</span> <span m='2168000'>detector is going to go down. If the frequency
  does not match</span> <span m='2173000'>the frequency of the vibration of HCl, well,</span>
  <span m='2176000'>the photons go right through, onto the detector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2180000'>But if it matches, then the molecule absorbs those</span> <span m='2184000'>photons
  and they never make it to the detector.</span> </p><p><span m='2187000'>So, a plot
  looks like this. This is the intensity at the</span> <span m='2193000'>detector
  versus the frequency of the radiation.</span> </p><p><span m='2196000'>The intensity
  will be high, but now at some frequency,</span> <span m='2200000'>which will turn
  out to be the vibrational frequency of the</span> <span m='2205000'>molecule, the
  intensity goes down low.</span> </p><p><span m='2207000'>And then, as you go to
  higher frequency, the intensity comes</span> <span m='2212000'>back up. Right here,
  the molecule has</span> <span m='2215000'>made the transition from v equal zero
  to v equal one because the</span> <span m='2219000'>frequency of that photon matches
  the energy difference between v</span> <span m='2224000'>equal zero and v equal
  one divided by h.</span> </p><p><span m='2229000'>It also happens to be the fundamental
  frequency of the</span> <span m='2233000'>molecule for HCl. So, that is how we know
  what</span> <span m='2238000'>those fundamental frequencies are.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2241000'>Let's now look at what those energies are.</span> </p><p><span m='2244000'>We
  have gone from v equal zero to v equal one.</span> </p><p><span m='2250000'>Delta
  E equal h nu. We just</span> <span m='2254000'>measured nu as 8.6x10^13 inverse
  seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='2259000'>Multiply it by h. That is going to give
  us delta</span> <span m='2264000'>E. The difference in energy</span> <span m='2266000'>between
  the two states is 5.7x10^-20 joules.</span> </p><p><span m='2271000'>If I turn that
  into kilojoules per mole, that is 35 kilojoules</span> <span m='2277000'>per mole.
  That is the energy difference</span> <span m='2282000'>from here to here, about
  35 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='2286000'>How strong is the HCl bond?
  Well, the HCl bond from here to</span> <span m='2292000'>here is about 420 kilojoules
  per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='2295000'>This is about a tenth, a little bit less
  than a tenth</span> <span m='2300000'>of the total bond strength for HCl.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2303000'>If we make it vibrate, we are not going to make that</span>
  <span m='2307000'>bond break. It is an order of magnitude</span> <span m='2312000'>less
  energy here than what you need to break that bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2318000'>Now,
  here is something that is a little confusing.</span> </p><p><span m='2324000'>These
  fundamental frequencies, it turns out that we actually</span> <span m='2330000'>use
  a different convention to label them, different units.</span> </p><p><span m='2336000'>We
  do not use Hertz very often to talk about the fundamental</span> <span m='2343000'>frequencies
  of molecules. We use something called a</span> <span m='2349000'>wavenumber instead
  of hertz. A wavenumber is an inverse</span> <span m='2355000'>centimeter, centimeter
  to the minus one power.</span> </p><p><span m='2359000'>The symbol for a wavenumber
  is a frequency sign with a bar on</span> <span m='2365000'>top of it. That is a
  wave number.</span> </p><p><span m='2370000'>How do we get a wavenumber? Well, we
  get a wavenumber by</span> <span m='2375000'>taking the frequency in Hertz, inverse
  seconds,</span> <span m='2379000'>and dividing it by the speed of light.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2382000'>But the speed of light, of course, has to be in</span>
  <span m='2386000'>centimeters per second. The seconds cancel,</span> <span m='2390000'>and
  what we have then left is inverse centimeters.</span> </p><p><span m='2396000'>For
  example, if the fundamental frequency of</span> <span m='2400000'>HCl was 8.6x10^13
  hertz, we divide that by the speed of</span> <span m='2406000'>light in centimeters
  per second and the wavenumbers,</span> <span m='2412000'>or the fundamental frequency
  in wavenumbers, then,</span> <span m='2417000'>is 2,886 wavenumbers for HCl. These
  are the common units that</span> <span m='2424000'>are used to talk about the fundamental
  vibrational</span> <span m='2429000'>frequencies of molecules. And these are the
  common</span> <span m='2435000'>numbers used to discuss infrared spectra of molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2440000'>This unit of a wavenumber. It is a non-SI unit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2444000'>In other words, what you will often see is an</span> <span
  m='2447000'>infrared spectrum intensity at the photodiode,</span> <span m='2451000'>now,
  versus wave number. And right at 2,886 wavenumbers,</span> <span m='2456000'>that
  is the fundamental frequency in wavenumbers.</span> </p><p><span m='2461000'>That
  is where the molecule makes the transition from v</span> <span m='2466000'>equal
  zero to v equal one. Now, the question is,</span> <span m='2471000'>what determines
  the frequency of the vibration of a molecule?</span> </p><p><span m='2478000'>Well,
  what determines the frequency of that vibration,</span> <span m='2483000'>and here,
  I have now gone back to frequency because I am</span> <span m='2489000'>writing
  it in terms of some other parameters,</span> <span m='2494000'>are two parameters.
  One is the force constant k,</span> <span m='2500000'>and the other is the mass.
  What I have here is the reduced</span> <span m='2504000'>mass. I will explain that
  to you in</span> <span m='2506000'>just a moment, but this is essentially the</span>
  <span m='2510000'>mass. The frequency is given by one</span> <span m='2512000'>over
  2pi times the square root of this k, the force constant</span> <span m='2517000'>over
  the mass.</span> </p><p><span m='2520000'>sqrt(k / m)** That force constant,</span>
  <span m='2524000'>k, is a measure of the stiffness of the spring.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2529000'>Another words, if you have a very stiff</span> <span m='2533000'>spring,
  k is very large. That is you need a lot of force</span> <span m='2539000'>to pull
  that spring apart, a lot of force to compress that</span> <span m='2545000'>spring.
  A large k means you have a very</span> <span m='2549000'>stiff spring. If you have
  a small k,</span> <span m='2554000'>that means you have a very weak spring.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2558000'>It does not take very much force to stretch that spring
  or</span> <span m='2565000'>to compress that spring. So k is a measure of the</span>
  <span m='2570000'>stiffness of the spring. It also tells us something</span> <span
  m='2576000'>about the shape of the interaction energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2582000'>Another
  words, what k actually tells us here</span> <span m='2586000'>is kind of the width
  of this well.</span> </p><p><span m='2589000'>Here is my interaction energy, potential
  well.</span> </p><p><span m='2594000'>If you have a very narrow width, this is a
  large k.</span> </p><p><span m='2599000'>If you have a very broad width, here, this
  is a small k.</span> </p><p><span m='2605000'>So, k, the force constant, tells us
  about the shape,</span> <span m='2610000'>here, of this well. Very narrow well,</span>
  <span m='2616000'>large k. Very broad well,</span> <span m='2620000'>small k. Now,
  I think that maybe you</span> <span m='2626000'>have seen this before in 8.01. Have
  you done the harmonic</span> <span m='2635000'>oscillator yet? No?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2637000'>Yes? Some yes.</span> </p><p><span m='2640000'>Some no. Mostly no, it
  sounds to me.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>This expression, here, for the frequency,</span>
  <span m='2647000'>you are going to see in 8.01 some time.</span> </p><p><span m='2650000'>It
  comes from the harmonic oscillator model.</span> </p><p><span m='2654000'>You will
  remember that you have seen this before.</span> </p><p><span m='2658000'>Those of
  you who have know what I am talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='2663000'>Those
  of you who have not, just remember you are going to</span> <span m='2668000'>see
  this very soon once again. Now, the other parameter here</span> <span m='2675000'>that
  is important is this mu here, this reduced mass.</span> </p><p><span m='2682000'>What
  the reduced mass is, is essentially the mass.</span> </p><p><span m='2689000'>Now,
  if you had already done this in 8.01,</span> <span m='2694000'>what you are going
  to look at is a mass on the end of a spring</span> <span m='2702000'>attached to
  a wall. There will be a wall,</span> <span m='2708000'>then you will see a spring,
  and then there will be some</span> <span m='2713000'>mass m. When you do this problem
  as a</span> <span m='2716000'>harmonic oscillator, you are going to write nu here</span>
  <span m='2721000'>as k over this mass right there. But, in this example,</span>
  <span m='2726000'>this mass here is the only body that is moving.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2732000'>Your wall is still. But, in the case of a molecule,</span> <span m='2736000'>both
  atoms are moving. What mass do we use?</span> </p><p><span m='2740000'>Well, the
  fact that both are moving means we have a two body</span> <span m='2746000'>problem.
  And we are going to have to</span> <span m='2749000'>change the coordinate system
  to take into account that both</span> <span m='2755000'>masses are moving. We can
  do that easily.</span> </p><p><span m='2760000'>And doing that easily involves using
  something called the</span> <span m='2764000'>reduced mass. The reduced mass takes
  a two</span> <span m='2768000'>body problem and reduces it to a single body, where
  the single</span> <span m='2773000'>body is this fictitious body with a mass given
  by the reduced</span> <span m='2778000'>mass. It is exact.</span> </p><p><span m='2779000'>I
  did not make any approximations here.</span> </p><p><span m='2782000'>But the bottom
  line is that this reduced mass is simply the</span> <span m='2787000'>mass of one
  atom, times the mass of the other,</span> <span m='2791000'>divided by the sum of
  the two masses.</span> </p><p><span m='2796000'>And sometimes a useful approximation
  is when one of the</span> <span m='2802000'>masses is much lower than the other
  mass, so when m1 here is</span> <span m='2809000'>smaller than m2. Well, you can
  see in that case,</span> <span m='2814000'>if m1 is very small compared to m2, we
  are going to treat it</span> <span m='2821000'>like a zero. And then these two m's
  are</span> <span m='2826000'>going to cancel. You can see the reduced mass is</span>
  <span m='2830000'>roughly equivalent to the mass of the smaller body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2834000'>Sometimes I will ask you to use that approximation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2838000'>Other times, I will ask you to calculate the</span> <span m='2842000'>reduced
  mass. Let's look at some frequencies</span> <span m='2845000'>for some molecules,
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2849000'>I have an array of molecules. All of them
  roughly have the</span> <span m='2853000'>same force constant. I am going to look
  at the mass</span> <span m='2858000'>dependence on the fundamental frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2861000'>I have got the frequencies written both in terms of wave</span>
  <span m='2866000'>numbers and Hertz. The first thing I want you to</span> <span
  m='2870000'>notice is the fundamental frequency for hydrogen,</span> <span m='2874000'>4,159
  wave numbers. That is the highest vibrational</span> <span m='2879000'>frequency
  that we know about. Why is it so high?</span> </p><p><span m='2884000'>Well, because
  those two hydrogens are so light,</span> <span m='2888000'>and the mass is in the
  denominator of that fundamental</span> <span m='2893000'>frequency. So if it is
  in the denominator,</span> <span m='2897000'>it is small, and the fundamental frequency</span>
  <span m='2900000'>is going to be high. Then look at these molecules,</span> <span
  m='2905000'>HCl, HBr, HI. In this case here,</span> <span m='2908000'>it is all
  a hydrogen bonded to a halogen.</span> </p><p><span m='2913000'>For the most part,
  the reduced mass of these three</span> <span m='2917000'>molecules is that of hydrogen.
  If that is of hydrogen,</span> <span m='2921000'>since that is in the denominator
  for the expression</span> <span m='2925000'>for the frequency, well, the frequencies
  are going</span> <span m='2930000'>to be high in general. And they are,</span> <span
  m='2933000'>2,886, 2,559. Not as high as molecular</span> <span m='2936000'>hydrogen,
  but still pretty high. And then we look at these three</span> <span m='2943000'>molecules,
  chlorine, bromine, iodine.</span> </p><p><span m='2946000'>Both particles very heavy.
  The reduced mass is large.</span> </p><p><span m='2952000'>Look at what happened
  to the frequency here.</span> </p><p><span m='2956000'>The frequency really has
  gone down much lower than it was for</span> <span m='2962000'>HCl, HBr or HI. So,
  that is one parameter.</span> </p><p><span m='2968000'>The other parameter, of course,
  is the force</span> <span m='2972000'>constant. Here are a set of molecules</span>
  <span m='2975000'>that have all roughly the same reduced mass,</span> <span m='2979000'>fluorine,
  oxygen, NO.</span> </p><p><span m='2981000'>And I have written down their frequencies,
  both in wave</span> <span m='2986000'>numbers and Hertz. For molecular fluorine,</span>
  <span m='2991000'>which has a single bond, that frequency here is pretty</span>
  <span m='2996000'>low, 892 wave numbers. It is pretty low.</span> </p><p><span m='3001000'>This
  is a single bond, which is easy to stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='3006000'>It is
  not very stiff. It is a loose bond,</span> <span m='3010000'>so to speak. But now,
  look at oxygen and NO.</span> </p><p><span m='3014320'>They have double bonds, which
  are stiffer.</span> </p><p><span m='3018000'>If they are stiffer, k is larger,</span>
  <span m='3021000'>the fundamental frequency is higher.</span> </p><p><span m='3024000'>Then,
  we look at CO and nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='3027000'>They have triple bonds,
  which are even stiffer.</span> </p><p><span m='3034000'>Stiffer bonds, larger k,
  higher fundamental</span> <span m='3038000'>frequency, that are those two parameters
  that dictate the</span> <span m='3043000'>frequency of vibration. We will do rotation
  on</span> <span m='3047816'>Wednesday. See you then.</span> </p>
