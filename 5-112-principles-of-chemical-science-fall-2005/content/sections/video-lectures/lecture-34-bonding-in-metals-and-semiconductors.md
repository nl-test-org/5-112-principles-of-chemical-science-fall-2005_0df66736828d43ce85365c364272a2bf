  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Welcome, everybody, on
  this snowy Friday.</span> </p><p><span m='18000'>At the end of last hour, and I
  just want to take a</span> <span m='22000'>minute or two here to finish this piece
  up,</span> <span m='26000'>we were talking about ways of writing kinetics expressions
  for</span> <span m='31000'>a particular type of assumed ligand substitution mechanism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='37000'>In particular, we were looking at dissociative</span> <span
  m='40000'>substitution. And now I would just like to</span> <span m='43000'>take
  you through what happens if you don't make the major</span> <span m='48000'>assumption
  that we made last time, which was that every time</span> <span m='52000'>our intermediate
  five coordinate complex ML five was</span> <span m='57000'>formed, it would go onto
  products.</span> </p><p><span m='61000'>That was our assumption last time, one of
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='64000'>And this steady state approximation is one that
  allows</span> <span m='68000'>us to simplify the rate expression.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71000'>If we don't make that assumption, what we say is that</span> <span m='75000'>the
  change with time of the concentration of the</span> <span m='79000'>intermediate
  is approximately zero.</span> </p><p><span m='81000'>We know that at the very beginning
  of the reaction,</span> <span m='85000'>we have this ML five X species.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90000'>X is the ligand that dissociates to give ML five,</span> <span m='93000'>so
  at time zero there is zero ML five</span> <span m='98000'>concentration. And let
  me just remind you of</span> <span m='101000'>this plot of what happens in a reaction
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='106000'>We have our initial ML five X species
  that decays</span> <span m='110000'>away, and we have our product ML five Y that
  grows in.</span> </p><p><span m='117000'>And if this reaction goes by dissociative
  ligand</span> <span m='120000'>substitution, which would certainly be</span> <span
  m='122000'>consistent with a d four high spin electron count,</span> <span m='126000'>as
  we saw last time, then there may be some</span> <span m='129000'>intermediate ML
  five that at time zero has zero</span> <span m='133000'>concentration. And it may
  never really build</span> <span m='136000'>up very much concentration. And then
  at the end,</span> <span m='140000'>it goes down to zero, too, because when the
  reaction</span> <span m='143000'>is over, all of our ML five has a Y attached and
  is</span> <span m='147000'>six-coordinate again. If the concentration of the ML</span>
  <span m='152000'>five intermediate never really builds up very much,</span> <span
  m='155000'>which is quite often the case, it may not be observable,</span> <span
  m='159000'>the amount of which is produced during the reaction,</span> <span m='162000'>then
  this approximation is pretty valid and allows us to</span> <span m='166000'>derive
  equations for the change with time of the species that we</span> <span m='170000'>can
  observe, namely the starting material that is going away and</span> <span m='175000'>the
  product that is coming in. And so this is our</span> <span m='180000'>concentration
  versus time plot for the reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='186000'>And with this
  approximation, we can then set equal to zero</span> <span m='193000'>the expression
  for the formation of the intermediate,</span> <span m='200000'>which is k1 times
  ML five X.</span> </p><p><span m='207000'>This quantity k1, if you remember back
  to the</span> <span m='210000'>diagram we were using last time, k1 is the rate constant</span>
  <span m='214000'>associated with surmounting that first energy barrier,</span> <span
  m='218000'>k1 times ML five X.</span> </p><p><span m='220000'>That produces ML five,
  so this is producing</span> <span m='224000'>it, but when you are in the middle
  of the well,</span> <span m='228000'>where the intermediate lies, there are two
  ways to destroy</span> <span m='232000'>ML five. You can go minus k minus one ML</span>
  <span m='236000'>five times X.</span> </p><p><span m='240000'>This brings you, then,
  back over to where you</span> <span m='243000'>started. And you can also lose it
  in a</span> <span m='246000'>productive sense by k two times ML five times our species
  Y,</span> <span m='251000'>which brings us onto products.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>And
  we are still making the assumption that once you get to</span> <span m='260000'>products,
  the reaction is done and you never go back.</span> </p><p><span m='265000'>That
  assumption is built into this analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='270000'>And if we
  look at this, we have set it equal to zero,</span> <span m='275000'>meaning that
  ML five is not building up.</span> </p><p><span m='279000'>And so now, what we can
  do is we can rearrange this expression</span> <span m='285000'>and solve it for
  the concentration of ML five.</span> </p><p><span m='290000'>And you will see that
  you can do that here.</span> </p><p><span m='294000'>ML five becomes equal to k1
  times ML five X --</span> <span m='310000'>That is the expression for the formation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='316000'>These two brackets should be done.</span> </p><p><span m='321000'>ML
  five X over k minus one times Y plus.</span> </p><p><span m='328000'>Sorry. That
  should be X,</span> <span m='331000'>here. Plus k2, times Y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='333000'>The expression</span> <span m='337000'>in the denominator here are those
  two quantities that take</span> <span m='342000'>us out of the well. And on the
  top,</span> <span m='344000'>we have the one quantity that takes us into the well
  from the</span> <span m='349000'>starting materials. And so now, we have an</span>
  <span m='352000'>expression for ML five that we can plug into our</span> <span m='356000'>expression
  for the rate. The rate overall expressed as</span> <span m='362000'>the appearance
  of the final product is going to be equal to</span> <span m='368000'>k2 times ML
  five, this is going over the final</span> <span m='373000'>barrier, times Y. And
  so,</span> <span m='378000'>if we take the expression here for the rate,</span>
  <span m='382000'>this is the value that we expect for the appearance of</span> <span
  m='387000'>products. We take that substitute in this</span> <span m='391000'>expression
  for the unobserved intermediate,</span> <span m='394000'>ML five, into this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='396000'>Then we have an expression for the rate entirely in terms
  of</span> <span m='400000'>things that we can either observe, namely the starting</span>
  <span m='403000'>material, the concentration we would measure by some technique,</span>
  <span m='407000'>like spectrophotometry as a function of time,</span> <span m='410000'>watching
  an absorbance band for it decay away,</span> <span m='413000'>for example. And then
  also in terms of the</span> <span m='416000'>concentration of Y which we were talking
  about as the solvent,</span> <span m='420000'>so it would have a large invariant
  and known</span> <span m='423000'>concentration. And then, of course,</span> <span
  m='425000'>since X is being produced in the reaction whenever it</span> <span m='428000'>dissociates
  from the starting material, there is a</span> <span m='432000'>relationship between
  the concentration of X at any time</span> <span m='435000'>and the concentration
  of our starting material at any time.</span> </p><p><span m='440000'>Now we get
  an expression that we need to be able to integrate</span> <span m='444000'>in order
  to actually produce, given these parameters,</span> <span m='447000'>k1, k minus
  1, and k2, to produce a predicted</span> <span m='451000'>dataset to compare with
  the experimental.</span> </p><p><span m='454000'>And what one normally does is you
  take an experimental</span> <span m='457000'>dataset, you have the equations that
  arise from your mechanistic</span> <span m='462000'>hypothesis, and you do a least
  squares fitting procedure to</span> <span m='466000'>obtain the values of the parameters,
  which are these</span> <span m='469000'>phenomenological rate constants associated
  with each step in the</span> <span m='474000'>mechanism. Extract the values of the</span>
  <span m='477000'>parameters, and see what you get, see if the mechanism that</span>
  <span m='482000'>you have assumed can give you a good fit to the data or whether</span>
  <span m='486000'>it cannot. That is the end of my</span> <span m='489000'>discussion
  of an introduction to kinetic analysis of chemical</span> <span m='493000'>reactions,
  a really important subject where differential</span> <span m='498000'>equations
  really become very important.</span> </p><p><span m='500000'>Today, I want to get
  onto the top of extended solids,</span> <span m='504000'>and so I am going to talk
  about dimensionality,</span> <span m='508000'>here.</span> </p><p><span m='518000'>And
  materials.</span> </p><p><span m='527000'>And I want you to keep in mind the framework
  with which we have</span> <span m='530000'>been discussing chemical bonding all
  throughout this semester</span> <span m='534000'>because we are going to extend
  that today to try to understand</span> <span m='538000'>some of the properties of
  systems that are not molecular,</span> <span m='542000'>but extend infinity in some
  number of dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m='546000'>We talked about the H two molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='549000'>This is a very small molecular system that we have described</span>
  <span m='555000'>and talked about quite a bit. This system has a radius,</span>
  <span m='560000'>here, of about 0.64 angstroms, or internuclear distance of</span>
  <span m='565000'>about 0.64 angstroms. And then, we can also consider</span> <span
  m='569000'>molecules that become more extended.</span> </p><p><span m='579000'>There
  is an example of a polyene.</span> </p><p><span m='585000'>And my use of a polyene,
  here, should lead you to think</span> <span m='588000'>that when we consider polymer
  chemistry, in some cases,</span> <span m='592000'>we will be talking about systems
  that are extended,</span> <span m='595000'>maybe not infinitely, but very greatly
  in one</span> <span m='598000'>direction, or maybe more than one direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='602000'>But polyenes are interesting species because if this thing</span>
  <span m='605000'>had all the double bonds, trans, as I have drawn here,</span> <span
  m='609000'>then what we have perpendicular to the board would be a set of p</span>
  <span m='614000'>orbitals, one p orbital perpendicular to the board on</span> <span
  m='617000'>each of these carbons. And all of those p orbitals can</span> <span m='621000'>overlap.
  And then, we can start talking</span> <span m='624000'>about the transport of electrons
  down a chain like this in one</span> <span m='628000'>dimension. So I put H two
  up here</span> <span m='632000'>as an example of what is approximately a zero dimensional</span>
  <span m='637000'>system. Here is a system that extends</span> <span m='640000'>somewhat
  in one dimension. And then, as an example of a</span> <span m='645000'>two dimensional
  system, let me just draw up here a</span> <span m='649000'>piece of one of the sheets
  of the graphite structure.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>Graphite is one of the
  allotropes of carbon.</span> </p><p><span m='663000'>And graphite is a really nice
  2d structure.</span> </p><p><span m='667000'>I can draw in some of the unsaturation
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='671000'>And I don't mean to suggest that this thing
  stops here.</span> </p><p><span m='675000'>These carbons on the parameter of the
  graphite system have</span> <span m='680000'>bonds, and the structure looks very
  much like what I have drawn</span> <span m='686000'>here, if you repeat outward,
  up, down, left,</span> <span m='689000'>or right. And what that leads to are</span>
  <span m='694000'>two-dimensional planar arrays of carbon atoms that,</span> <span
  m='699000'>as with the polyene structure, here this polyene that I drew</span> <span
  m='704000'>with six bonds, is about 13 angstroms long.</span> </p><p><span m='708000'>And
  then the problem that you get to with graphite is that</span> <span m='713000'>these
  graphite sheets can have dimensions of millimeters.</span> </p><p><span m='720000'>You
  have gone from something short to something very,</span> <span m='723000'>very large.
  And we are going infinitely.</span> </p><p><span m='726000'>I am going to show you
  a little bit more about this.</span> </p><p><span m='730000'>I am going to let you
  look at this website yourselves.</span> </p><p><span m='734000'>You are going to
  find that I did put into the notes for today</span> <span m='739000'>the website
  that we are going to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>And it is for you to
  go ahead and look at in three-dimensions</span> <span m='746000'>at the structure
  of the graphite.</span> </p><p><span m='750000'>And also, in particular, I want
  you to be able to look</span> <span m='754000'>at the structure of the diamond framework.</span>
  </p><p><span m='758000'>One of the things that I want you to be thinking about in</span>
  <span m='763000'>association with today's lecture are the way that atoms pack in</span>
  <span m='769000'>three dimensions when you make up a solid material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='774000'>You will see why that is important in just a moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='780000'>And so we are going to have to go from bonds to bands in order</span>
  <span m='787000'>to make this transition.</span> </p><p><span m='798000'>And that
  means we are going to have to talk about band</span> <span m='803000'>structure
  today and where bands come from.</span> </p><p><span m='807000'>This, by the way,
  the title for this panel from</span> <span m='812000'>bonds to bands is actually
  the inverse of a title that was</span> <span m='817000'>penned for a beautiful article
  written by Professor Roald</span> <span m='823000'>Hoffmann. And he was actually
  one of my</span> <span m='827000'>teachers as an undergraduate at Cornell University,</span>
  <span m='832000'>and he also won the Nobel Prize for his contributions to theory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='840000'>And I refer you to his article from bands to bonds if you
  want</span> <span m='843000'>to learn more about this topic because, although the
  concepts</span> <span m='847000'>of solid state physics are often discussed with
  very different</span> <span m='851000'>terminology than the concepts of electronic
  structure theory for</span> <span m='855000'>molecules, there are a lot of very
  important parallelisms.</span> </p><p><span m='858000'>And one of the things that
  Professor Hoffmann is very good</span> <span m='862000'>at is in bridging the gap
  between different branches of</span> <span m='865000'>science that talk about the
  same things but don't realize that</span> <span m='869000'>they are talking about
  the same things.</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>And so here we have a system with
  a single orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='877000'>We are going to look at the number
  of orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='881000'>And here is a system with one. And this
  is an energy level</span> <span m='886000'>diagram. We have used energy level</span>
  <span m='889000'>diagrams for a lot of things. Last lecture,</span> <span m='893000'>we
  used them to discuss potential energy surfaces of</span> <span m='897000'>chemical
  reactions, in addition to all these other</span> <span m='901000'>properties. Here
  is a system with one</span> <span m='905000'>orbital. And then, as you know,</span>
  <span m='907000'>when you have a system with two orbitals, you can get bonding</span>
  <span m='911000'>and antibonding. This is the hydrogen problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='915000'>This might be a hydrogen atom, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='917000'>Here
  is an H two molecular orbital diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='921000'>And then we
  can consider a system that might have three</span> <span m='925000'>orbitals populated,
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='928000'>And then, if we have a system with four
  orbitals,</span> <span m='932000'>it might be something like that, four electrons
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='938000'>We see that one of the features is that
  the energy levels are</span> <span m='944000'>starting to come closer together as
  we get more and more of them.</span> </p><p><span m='950000'>There are five. Here
  is six.</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>And then, onto seven. And you start running
  out of</span> <span m='965000'>room to draw them. And so, what people do then</span>
  <span m='970000'>with this problem, we are only up to seven and we</span> <span
  m='976000'>have almost run out of space to draw these things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='982000'>So what do we do? We draw them,</span> <span m='985000'>when we get out
  to infinity here, as a band.</span> </p><p><span m='992000'>What the idea is, is
  that we have here this band</span> <span m='995000'>diagram, as we are going to
  call them, a type of diagram in which</span> <span m='1001000'>we are representing
  field orbitals down here as some kind</span> <span m='1005000'>of continuum. Because
  there are so many of</span> <span m='1009000'>them, an infinite number of orbitals
  that are all</span> <span m='1013000'>interacting in some extended solid material,</span>
  <span m='1016000'>we are going to be talking today a little bit about silicon</span>
  <span m='1021000'>and germanium and things like gallium nitride,</span> <span m='1025000'>in
  which you have a lattice that extends periodically in</span> <span m='1030000'>three-dimensions.
  And so these molecular orbitals</span> <span m='1035000'>spread out and cover the
  whole material.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>Electrons can be anywhere at once
  within this entire extended</span> <span m='1043000'>solid by virtue of these delocalized
  orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='1046000'>And then, just like in molecules, there
  are empty</span> <span m='1050000'>orbitals. And they occur,</span> <span m='1053000'>also,
  in a continuum. I would like you to get your</span> <span m='1057000'>mind around
  going from both ends to the same place in that type</span> <span m='1063000'>of
  continuum. And the idea that these band</span> <span m='1066000'>structure diagrams
  that people use to describe the electronic</span> <span m='1072000'>structure properties
  of extended materials are really molecular</span> <span m='1077000'>orbital diagrams.
  And so let's take a typical</span> <span m='1084000'>metal, where n equals three,
  principle quantum number three.</span> </p><p><span m='1093000'>The atom has a 1s
  orbital. It has a 2s and a set of 2p</span> <span m='1101000'>orbitals. It has a
  3s orbital and a set</span> <span m='1107000'>of 3p. And so there is an atom,</span>
  <span m='1111000'>like a sodium atom, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='1114000'>And
  here is our energy axis. What happens is that each of</span> <span m='1118000'>these
  orbitals, that when you put all these</span> <span m='1122000'>atoms together into
  a piece of solid sodium metal,</span> <span m='1126000'>we talked about that earlier
  in the semester,</span> <span m='1129000'>these orbitals overlap, spread out and
  form bands.</span> </p><p><span m='1133000'>And there is a band very low in energy
  that is derived from the</span> <span m='1138000'>1s electrons in a metal like sodium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1143000'>And it is completely full. And then there is a band from</span>
  <span m='1147000'>the 2s and there is a band, accordingly,</span> <span m='1151000'>from
  the 2p. And then there will be a band</span> <span m='1154000'>from the 3s, and
  a band from the 3p that I have run out of room</span> <span m='1160000'>to draw
  there. And notice that the bands that</span> <span m='1163000'>originate from atomic
  orbitals having the same principle</span> <span m='1168000'>quantum number here,
  2s and 2p, are overlapping.</span> </p><p><span m='1174000'>In the case of a sodium
  atom, this 2s band is completely full</span> <span m='1180000'>with electrons and
  the 2p band is completely full.</span> </p><p><span m='1185000'>And this 3s band
  here, in the case of sodium,</span> <span m='1189000'>is half full. Furthermore,</span>
  <span m='1192000'>we are going to call these filled bands that are at the</span>
  <span m='1197000'>highest energy. This corresponds to our highest</span> <span m='1202000'>occupied
  molecular orbital. That will be called the valance</span> <span m='1208000'>band.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1216000'>And then up here, the lowest unoccupied band is</span>
  <span m='1222000'>called the conduction band.</span> </p><p><span m='1234000'>And
  so, in the case of sodium metal, this 3s band is half</span> <span m='1241000'>full.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1247000'>And, if we go over to magnesium, this same 3s band is</span>
  <span m='1255000'>now full. And if we go to aluminum,</span> <span m='1260000'>that
  3s band is full, and the 3p band is partly full.</span> </p><p><span m='1274000'>And
  it is a consequence of the fact that the electrons in the</span> <span m='1277000'>valance
  band are right here at the same energy as the lowest</span> <span m='1281000'>part
  of the conduction band in a metal that gives metals their</span> <span m='1285000'>luster.
  It gives them their 100%</span> <span m='1287000'>optical reflectivity, --</span>
  <span m='1290000'>-- these properties that we very much associate with metals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1294000'>And so from analyzing band structure diagrams,</span> <span
  m='1297000'>even simplified ones, like the ones you will find</span> <span m='1300000'>here
  and in your textbook today, you can really say a lot about</span> <span m='1304000'>the
  properties of different materials.</span> </p><p><span m='1318000'>When you have
  a meeting of the valance band and the conduction</span> <span m='1327000'>band,
  then your material is a conductor and is metallic.</span> </p><p><span m='1336000'>And
  then, there are other possibilities,</span> <span m='1342000'>of course. You may
  have a valance band</span> <span m='1348000'>that is separated by some energy gap
  from the conduction band.</span> </p><p><span m='1360000'>And if that is that is
  the case, then you have a</span> <span m='1365000'>semi-conductor, such as silicon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1368000'>And then, finally, you can have a large gap</span> <span
  m='1373000'>between your valance band and your conduction band.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1380000'>And, in all cases, like with an MO diagram,</span> <span m='1383000'>we
  are putting these things on an energy axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1386000'>We are
  filling up electrons from the bottom in this material</span> <span m='1390000'>from
  the standpoint of energy, and so you have a large gap,</span> <span m='1395000'>here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1402000'>And you have a material that is an insulator.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1410000'>And I think you will appreciate why that is in a moment,</span> <span
  m='1413000'>but I want to bring Boltzmann's law to bear on the issue of</span> <span
  m='1417000'>electronic structure in extended networks, like we are talking</span>
  <span m='1421000'>about today.</span> </p><p><span m='1430000'>In materials like
  the ones I have drawn over here,</span> <span m='1433000'>the ability to conduct
  electricity is related to the</span> <span m='1436000'>probability of electrons
  being in the conduction band.</span> </p><p><span m='1447000'>So we need to know
  something about electrons in the</span> <span m='1453000'>conduction band. And,
  using a Boltzmann</span> <span m='1459000'>distribution, we can write that probability</span>
  <span m='1465000'>as being related to one over (e to the (delta E over RT)) plus</span>
  <span m='1473000'>one.</span> </p><p><span m='1480000'>And, with an expression like
  this, this delta E here</span> <span m='1484000'>corresponds to our gap. And so
  it is possible,</span> <span m='1489000'>then, to go ahead and estimate the number
  of electrons that</span> <span m='1494000'>would be present in a cubic centimeter
  of your material in</span> <span m='1500000'>the condition band as a function of
  this energy gap.</span> </p><p><span m='1506000'>And so we can consider that for
  materials like carbon or silicon</span> <span m='1510000'>or elemental germanium.
  In the case of carbon,</span> <span m='1514000'>I am talking about diamond. And
  you should definitely go to</span> <span m='1518000'>that specified website and
  look at the diamond structure and try</span> <span m='1523000'>to get an appreciation
  for how the carbon atoms in diamond pack</span> <span m='1528000'>in three dimensions.
  From a hybridization</span> <span m='1532000'>standpoint, all the carbons in graphite
  are sp two.</span> </p><p><span m='1537000'>Whereas, in diamond all the carbons
  are sp three</span> <span m='1542000'>and tetrahedral. And completing this table,</span>
  <span m='1546000'>--</span> <span m='1553000'>-- we can write down delta E in kilojoules
  per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1560000'>The gap for diamond is kilojoules per
  mole,</span> <span m='1566000'>for silicon, 117 kilojoules per mole,</span> <span
  m='1570000'>and for germanium, 66 kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1576000'>And
  here is the number of electrons per centimeter cubed</span> <span m='1583000'>in
  the material in the conduction band.</span> </p><p><span m='1590000'>And, based
  on this large energy gap in the diamond structure,</span> <span m='1597000'>this
  value is on the order of 10^-27.</span> </p><p><span m='1601000'>Very small. This
  is an insulator.</span> </p><p><span m='1605000'>Diamond is an insulator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1614000'>And, on the other hand, silicon, the number of</span> <span
  m='1617000'>electrons per cubic centimeter that are in the conduction band</span>
  <span m='1621000'>are on the order of 10^9. This much smaller gap in the</span>
  <span m='1626000'>case of silicon, despite the fact that the</span> <span m='1630000'>silicon
  atoms also are tetrahedrally disposed with</span> <span m='1635000'>respect to their
  bonding, just as in the diamond case,</span> <span m='1640000'>we have a much smaller
  gap, 10^9.</span> </p><p><span m='1643000'>And that makes silicon, as you know,</span>
  <span m='1647000'>a semiconductor. And then germanium,</span> <span m='1652000'>10^13,
  so even more. It is getting closer and closer</span> <span m='1657000'>to being
  metallic as the gap shrinks as we compare these</span> <span m='1663000'>materials.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1671000'>And, having said that, we need to talk about the</span>
  <span m='1676000'>different types of materials that we can have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1681000'>I want you to understand the difference between intrinsic and</span>
  <span m='1688000'>extrinsic semiconductors.</span> </p><p><span m='1705000'>If a
  semiconductor material is an intrinsic semiconductor,</span> <span m='1708000'>that
  means that it is a semiconductor in its pure state.</span> </p><p><span m='1730000'>And
  why would we make that reference?</span> </p><p><span m='1731000'>I mean normally,
  we are always talking about</span> <span m='1733000'>pure things. But, actually,</span>
  <span m='1735000'>you will see in a moment that people do purposely make impure</span>
  <span m='1737000'>semiconductors for very good reasons.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>And
  we will discuss semiconductor when pure.</span> </p><p><span m='1744000'>And what
  that means is you have a system like this with some</span> <span m='1751000'>kind
  of a small band gap, as we have suggested.</span> </p><p><span m='1756000'>Here
  is our energy axis. And what can happen is that,</span> <span m='1762000'>either
  thermally or upon absorption of light energy,</span> <span m='1768000'>we can have
  promotion of an electron from the valance band</span> <span m='1774000'>into the
  conduction band. And so I will draw that new</span> <span m='1782000'>situation
  over here. In other words,</span> <span m='1786000'>we may have thermal population
  of our conduction band.</span> </p><p><span m='1792000'>And we generate, accordingly,</span>
  <span m='1795000'>a hole. In this intrinsic</span> <span m='1798000'>semiconductor,
  for every electron that jumps</span> <span m='1803000'>up into the conduction band
  and can then provide conductivity by</span> <span m='1809000'>electron transport
  --</span> <span m='1828000'>Down here, in the valance band, the missing electron
  generates</span> <span m='1832000'>a hole. And that hole can move around</span>
  <span m='1834000'>freely in the valance band. How does it do that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1837000'>Well, it is a little bit like the mechanism that we studied</span> <span
  m='1841000'>earlier for translocation of protons in acidic water.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1845000'>If an electron that is nearby the hole jumps into the hole,</span> <span
  m='1849000'>it creates another hole. The hole thereby moves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1852000'>And so here, we can have hole transport in</span> <span m='1855000'>our
  valance band. You can have conductivity</span> <span m='1860000'>occurring freely
  both in the valance band and in the</span> <span m='1865000'>conduction band for
  an intrinsic semiconductor of this type,</span> <span m='1871000'>where the number
  of holes is equal to the number of</span> <span m='1875000'>electrons. And you might
  begin to suspect</span> <span m='1879000'>that for an extrinsic semiconductor,</span>
  <span m='1883000'>the number of holes does not equal the number of electrons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1912000'>How does that work? In these extrinsic</span> <span m='1914000'>semiconductors
  wherein you have differing numbers of holes and</span> <span m='1919000'>electrons,
  you are purposely adding a small percentage of</span> <span m='1923000'>impurities
  to your material. Let me draw two pictures to</span> <span m='1930000'>represent
  this. Here, I would like to draw just</span> <span m='1937000'>a simple tetrahedron.
  We are looking at a very small</span> <span m='1944000'>part of the silicon structure.
  Let me put the silicons in here</span> <span m='1952000'>in color. Each silicon
  is coordinated to</span> <span m='1955000'>four other silicons in elemental silicon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1959000'>It is tetrahedral silicon all through this three-dimensional</span>
  <span m='1964000'>material in which these bands have been created,</span> <span
  m='1968000'>and in which we have valance and conduction bands.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1972000'>But what if we have synthesized our silicon with a little bit of</span>
  <span m='1977000'>boron impurity? If we do that,</span> <span m='1981000'>then boron
  goes into a position in the crystal lattice that is</span> <span m='1985000'>normally
  occupied by silicon, so boron finds itself</span> <span m='1989000'>surrounded by
  four silicons, each of which wishes to donate</span> <span m='1994000'>an electron
  to the boron to form an electron pair bond.</span> </p><p><span m='1998000'>But
  boron only has three of the needed four electrons to make</span> <span m='2003000'>those
  four two-electron bonds and to generate the octet.</span> </p><p><span m='2009000'>And
  so what happens is it wants to get an electron.</span> </p><p><span m='2013000'>And
  where can it get an electron from?</span> </p><p><span m='2017000'>It can get an
  electron from the valance band,</span> <span m='2021000'>from the HOMO of the system,
  from what would be able to</span> <span m='2026000'>donate an electron in the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2029000'>The way this then works is as follows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2034000'>You should think about the structure of elemental silicon</span> <span
  m='2038000'>with a small number of boron atoms dispersed throughout that</span>
  <span m='2043000'>structure as creating localized negative charges that cannot</span>
  <span m='2048000'>move because they are localized on these borons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2052000'>And that generates for you a band structure diagram like</span> <span
  m='2056000'>this. You have bands,</span> <span m='2058000'>but then you have slipped
  in there a little orbital from the</span> <span m='2063000'>boron, a little electronic
  state here, an intermediate between</span> <span m='2068000'>the valance band and
  the conduction band.</span> </p><p><span m='2073000'>So you have to choose your
  impurity correctly,</span> <span m='2076000'>so that it has the right energy with
  respect to the valance band</span> <span m='2081000'>and the conduction band in
  order for the process that you want to</span> <span m='2086000'>occur. Here is our
  boron-derived</span> <span m='2088000'>state, here, and it needs that extra electron
  because it is</span> <span m='2093000'>electron deficient when you put it in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2096000'>And so an electron jumps onto the boron, we will represent</span>
  <span m='2101000'>that this way, in the material like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2104000'>And this electron is fixed in position --</span> <span m='2115000'>--
  because it is associated with a negative charge that has</span> <span m='2120000'>formed
  on the boron. And a corresponding hole is</span> <span m='2125000'>formed down in
  the conduction band, and this hole transport</span> <span m='2130000'>can give rise
  to conductivity.</span> </p><p><span m='2142000'>And so notice that in this type
  of semiconductor,</span> <span m='2146000'>and this, by the way, is a p-type semiconductor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2150000'>P for positive. You are putting in a hole on</span> <span
  m='2154000'>that boron, so this is a p-type of semiconductor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2160000'>This thing is stuck on the boron, and it generates a hole</span> <span
  m='2163000'>that is free to move in the valance band and give rise to</span> <span
  m='2167000'>conductivity. And so in this extrinsic-type</span> <span m='2170000'>of
  semiconductor, you are not necessarily getting</span> <span m='2173000'>any conductivity
  up here in the normal conduction band but down</span> <span m='2177000'>in the valance
  band due to the creation of the hole.</span> </p><p><span m='2181000'>And then the
  parallel situation to that would be where you have</span> <span m='2185000'>something
  that you dope into the structure that has one more</span> <span m='2189000'>electron
  than what is normally in the structure.</span> </p><p><span m='2194000'>Normally,
  you are putting in silicon atoms each of which has</span> <span m='2198000'>four
  valance electrons. You put in a phosphorus atom,</span> <span m='2201000'>which
  isn't nearly the same size as silicon,</span> <span m='2204000'>but has five valance
  electrons. So you have this phosphorus in</span> <span m='2208000'>here, and it
  is tetrahedrally coordinated to four silicons.</span> </p><p><span m='2212000'>And
  there is only a few percentage of phosphorous atoms</span> <span m='2216000'>doped
  into this silicon semiconductor.</span> </p><p><span m='2220000'>And the phosphorus,
  what happens is it goes in</span> <span m='2223000'>there. It has an extra electron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2225000'>It wants to give it up so that it can have just an octet
  and</span> <span m='2230000'>form these four bonds to the four silicons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2233000'>And when it gives up that electron, the electron goes out</span>
  <span m='2237000'>and that forms a positive charge that is localized and fixed on</span>
  <span m='2242000'>the phosphorous center in the structure.</span> </p><p><span m='2245000'>And
  so, we can represent that as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='2250000'>Where we have
  a phosphorus state that we had chosen</span> <span m='2254000'>appropriately in
  energy to go ahead and give up that electron,</span> <span m='2259000'>it gives
  up the electron to the lowest unoccupied orbitals in</span> <span m='2265000'>the
  system, which is the bottom part of your conduction band.</span> </p><p><span m='2270000'>This
  electron jumps up off the phosphorus and into the</span> <span m='2274000'>conduction
  band, and that leaves behind a hole.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>So you have
  a hole or a positive charge,</span> <span m='2283000'>there, fixed in position.
  And now you can have electron</span> <span m='2288000'>transport as your mechanism
  of conductivity,</span> <span m='2292000'>up in the conduction band. It is really,</span>
  <span m='2295000'>I think, quite fascinating to think about the way in which the</span>
  <span m='2301000'>concept of the octet rule and our understanding of bonding in</span>
  <span m='2306000'>tetrahedral centers can actually lead us to understand the</span>
  <span m='2311000'>mechanism of conductivity in solid materials that are either</span>
  <span m='2316000'>n-doped or p-doped. Here, it is quite clear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2322000'>And then, finally, I just want to take you through</span> <span m='2327000'>the
  way in which you can put the positive and negative doped</span> <span m='2334000'>materials
  together to create a device like a light-emitting</span> <span m='2340000'>diode.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2354000'>LED materials, these are obviously great</span> <span m='2356000'>things
  because you can generate light with a lot more efficiency</span> <span m='2361000'>in
  terms of energy than you can with incandescent bulbs.</span> </p><p><span m='2364000'>You
  can get them in all different colors.</span> </p><p><span m='2367000'>These are
  finding application in so many different ways.</span> </p><p><span m='2372000'>One
  of the challenges that chemists have taken on is the</span> <span m='2375000'>discovery
  of light-emitting diode materials that are made of</span> <span m='2380000'>organic
  molecules, actually, conducting organic</span> <span m='2383000'>molecules that
  have properties correct for giving you very</span> <span m='2387000'>narrow emissions
  in the part of the spectrum that you want to</span> <span m='2392000'>have coming
  out of your light-emitting diode material.</span> </p><p><span m='2395000'>So chemistry
  is really very strongly involved in making</span> <span m='2399000'>next-generation
  LED materials. But I just want to tell you a</span> <span m='2405000'>little bit
  about how these things work.</span> </p><p><span m='2409000'>The idea is that you
  have these two types of semiconductors,</span> <span m='2414000'>and you juxtapose
  them at an interface.</span> </p><p><span m='2418000'>Let me make the interface
  with blue.</span> </p><p><span m='2421000'>You have a solid chunk of material, here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2425000'>This will be our N-type semiconductor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2430000'>And over here, they have a continuous,</span> <span m='2432000'>possibly
  two dimensional interface here in this</span> <span m='2435000'>three-dimensional
  chunk of material.</span> </p><p><span m='2438000'>And you have a P-type doped part
  of the system over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2442000'>And, in fact, normally
  this would be the same</span> <span m='2445000'>basic semiconductor material on
  both sides of the interface.</span> </p><p><span m='2449000'>And it would be just
  the doping that changes on the left versus</span> <span m='2454000'>the right. This
  material might be</span> <span m='2456000'>something like gallium nitride. Now,
  notice that this is a 3/5</span> <span m='2462000'>type of material. And this is
  gallium in Group 13</span> <span m='2466000'>and nitrogen in Group 15 of the Periodic
  Table.</span> </p><p><span m='2470000'>You add three and five together and you get
  eight,</span> <span m='2475000'>just the same number of valance electrons you would
  if you had</span> <span m='2480000'>silicon and silicon. But these materials have
  the</span> <span m='2484000'>property that they are a direct band gap material.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2490000'>And, as direct band gap materials, when the process that</span>
  <span m='2494000'>we are going to talk about here takes place at the interface,</span>
  <span m='2499000'>then out of this interface comes the light.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2503000'>And if your semiconductor material is an indirect band gap</span> <span
  m='2507000'>material like silicone is, then that is not the case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2512000'>And that has to do with the solid state physics of</span> <span m='2516000'>electronically,
  where is the conduction band</span> <span m='2519000'>located relative to that valance
  band?</span> </p><p><span m='2524000'>Has it shifted horizontally in solid physics-speak
  relative to</span> <span m='2528000'>the valance band? That's what makes a</span>
  <span m='2530000'>semiconductor an indirect band gap material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2533000'>If the conduction band is vertically situated above the</span> <span
  m='2537000'>valance band, then you get a direct band</span> <span m='2539000'>material.
  And so solid state chemists are</span> <span m='2542000'>interested in designing
  new materials that have a direct</span> <span m='2546000'>band gap and that can
  release light when this process takes</span> <span m='2550000'>place at the interface.
  And on both sides,</span> <span m='2554000'>I just want to sketch the band structure
  for the materials.</span> </p><p><span m='2559000'>And I mean the gap, actually,
  to be the same on</span> <span m='2563000'>both sides here. And the difference is
  what we</span> <span m='2567000'>have doped it with. In the case of the negative</span>
  <span m='2571000'>material, we have an electron up here in the conduction band that</span>
  <span m='2576000'>came in with, for example,</span> <span m='2578000'>our phosphorus
  atom and left behind a hole there that is</span> <span m='2583000'>fixed in space.
  And down here we have our</span> <span m='2588000'>valance band all full. Over here
  similar,</span> <span m='2591000'>except our material starts out with a hole down
  there because</span> <span m='2596000'>the electron has jumped up onto the doped
  atom and become fixed</span> <span m='2601000'>in space as a negative charge. And
  that left behind a hole in</span> <span m='2606000'>the valance band down there
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='2610000'>What you have is your N-doped material
  here on the left,</span> <span m='2615000'>your P-doped material on the right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2618000'>And, of course, what do you do then?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2622000'>You attach leads so that you can connect it to a potential</span> <span
  m='2627000'>difference. And, when you do that,</span> <span m='2631000'>you want
  your anode to be over here, so that the electrons can</span> <span m='2637000'>flow
  that way up to the N part of the device.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>And then
  electrons can flow this way, which means,</span> <span m='2647000'>of course, that
  holes go that way.</span> </p><p><span m='2651000'>And here is your cathode. And
  so you can think of putting</span> <span m='2656000'>on your potential difference
  in a system like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2661000'>And that has the effect of
  ripping electrons out over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2668000'>And, if you rip
  an electron out, let's say you take that</span> <span m='2671000'>negative charge
  back off of that boron atom, you pull an electron</span> <span m='2675000'>out to
  go ahead and reduce something down here in solution,</span> <span m='2679000'>if
  you are using a battery for this sort of process,</span> <span m='2682000'>well,
  then another electron can jump up here to take its place.</span> </p><p><span m='2686000'>But
  you are building up a potential, here.</span> </p><p><span m='2689000'>And so, what
  happens? The highest lying electron in</span> <span m='2692000'>the system over
  here in the N-type semiconductor is sitting</span> <span m='2696000'>there right
  at the junction right next to where electrons</span> <span m='2700000'>are needed.
  It jumps across.</span> </p><p><span m='2703000'>Electrons flow downhill, here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2705000'>And you can look at it like this, electrons flow down there,</span>
  <span m='2709000'>across the interface. And when you hook this LED up</span> <span
  m='2713000'>to your potential difference supply, the electron flow is</span> <span
  m='2717000'>unidirectional. As the electrons jump across</span> <span m='2721000'>the
  interface, they are going from the</span> <span m='2723000'>conduction band of the
  N-type semiconductor,</span> <span m='2727000'>they are going down in here, holes
  are being created,</span> <span m='2731000'>maybe electrons are being pulled right
  off of that boron,</span> <span m='2735000'>and they are moving right across here
  in a process that</span> <span m='2739000'>leads to the emission of light right
  at the interface.</span> </p><p><span m='2745000'>It is like a waterfall of electrons
  taking place all along</span> <span m='2749000'>this 2D interface. Electrons are
  just moving</span> <span m='2752000'>across this interface and dropping down in
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2756000'>As they drop down in energy, a photon that
  is the energy of</span> <span m='2761000'>this energy difference between the gap
  of this material,</span> <span m='2765000'>those photons are released for each electron
  that transits this</span> <span m='2770000'>barrier. And that is the principle of
  an</span> <span m='2774000'>LED. And I hope you are enjoying</span> <span m='2776000'>seeing
  this connection between molecular orbital theory for</span> <span m='2781000'>molecules
  being taken all the way to solid state physics.</span> </p><p><span m='2785000'>Have
  a nice weekend and we will see you on Monday.</span> </p>
