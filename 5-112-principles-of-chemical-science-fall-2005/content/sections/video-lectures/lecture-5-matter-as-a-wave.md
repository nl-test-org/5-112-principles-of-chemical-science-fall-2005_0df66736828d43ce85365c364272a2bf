  \ information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in\
  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>All right. Last time,\
  \ what we had done is</span> <span m='20000'>that we had looked at the first evidence\
  \ for the particle-like</span> <span m='29000'>nature of radiation. And that evidence\
  \ was a</span> <span m='35000'>photoelectric effect. The evidence was that what\
  \ you</span> <span m='39000'>had to have was a photon or a particle of energy,</span>\
  \ <span m='43000'>a quantum of energy, a packet of energy,</span> <span m='47000'>in\
  \ order to get an electron out.</span> <span m='50000'>And that energy had to be\
  \ at least the energy of the work</span> <span m='55000'>function of the metal.\
  \ And so for every packet you put</span> <span m='61000'>in there, you got one electron\
  \ out.</span> <span m='64000'>That is an example of the particle-like nature of</span>\
  \ <span m='69000'>radiation. But Einstein went on to show an</span> <span m='73000'>even\
  \ more convincing property of the particle likeness of</span> <span m='79000'>radiation\
  \ or a photon. And that is that what he did</span> <span m='84000'>was showed that\
  \ a photon has momentum.</span> <span m='90000'>It has momentum, even though a photon\
  \ does not</span> <span m='94000'>have mass, although a photon does not have rest\
  \ mass,</span> <span m='100000'>for those of you in the know in this area.</span>\
  \ <span m='104000'>And having momentum is very much a particle-like property,</span>\
  \ <span m='110000'>right? Because you know how to write</span> <span m='114000'>down\
  \ momentum. Momentum is mass times</span> <span m='117000'>velocity. You've got\
  \ a mass in here.</span> <span m='122000'>That is a particle-like property.</span>\
  \ <span m='125000'>And, yes, I am starting out with the lecture notes from</span>\
  \ <span m='131000'>number four, which I didn't finish last time.</span> <span m='135000'>That\
  \ is a particle-like property.</span> <span m='138000'>But what Einstein showed\
  \ was, from the relativistic equations</span> <span m='144000'>of motion, what drops\
  \ out from the relativistic equations of</span> <span m='150000'>motion is the fact\
  \ that a photon, at a frequency nu,</span> <span m='155000'>has a momentum h nu\
  \ over c.</span> <span m='161000'>And because we know the relationship between nu\
  \ and c,</span> <span m='167000'>nu times lambda equals c,</span> <span m='172000'>I\
  \ can write the momentum of a photon as h over lambda.</span> <span m='180000'>If\
  \ you have some radiation, this is the photon momentum</span> <span m='185000'>here.</span>\
  \ <span m='191000'>If you have some radiation, at a wavelength lambda,</span> <span\
  \ m='196000'>that radiation or those photons have this momentum p given by h</span>\
  \ <span m='202000'>over that wavelength. Now, that was a prediction from</span>\
  \ <span m='208000'>the relativistic equations of motion.</span> <span m='213000'>And\
  \ it took another eight, ten years or so before there</span> <span m='217000'>actually\
  \ was an experiment that demonstrated the momentum of a</span> <span m='222000'>photon.\
  \ And that experiment was called</span> <span m='225000'>the Compton experiment.\
  \ What went on in that experiment</span> <span m='229000'>is that an X-ray beam\
  \ came into some material or some molecule,</span> <span m='234000'>some atoms,\
  \ and they could actually see the transfer in the</span> <span m='239000'>momentum\
  \ from the photon to the atom.</span> <span m='243000'>Kind of like in this website\
  \ from the University of Colorado,</span> <span m='247000'>here. This is just a\
  \ cartoon of what</span> <span m='250000'>is happening, but I got this photon done\
  \ and</span> <span m='254000'>I got this atom coming at me. And I cannot move this\
  \ fast</span> <span m='258000'>enough. I am going to get clobbered.</span> <span\
  \ m='261000'>You have a different computer than I have.</span> <span m='264000'>Oh,\
  \ I have to push down. Okay.</span> <span m='268000'>Well, if I get aimed here,\
  \ these photons are coming at</span> <span m='273000'>this atom, coming at me. And,\
  \ boy, if I do it fast</span> <span m='279000'>enough, I can turn it around. Hey,\
  \ I did it.</span> <span m='283000'>But now, of course, if I go and lower the power.</span>\
  \ <span m='288000'>Come on. Come on.</span> <span m='290000'>Aah! I got killed.</span>\
  \ <span m='292000'>[LAUGHTER] Christine, I don't like your computer.</span> <span\
  \ m='297000'>Oh, wait. I have got to get it.</span> <span m='301000'>Get it. Get\
  \ it.</span> <span m='303000'>Get it. Please.</span> <span m='304000'>Please. Please.</span>\
  \ <span m='305000'>Aah. All right.</span> <span m='306000'>Well, you guys are going\
  \ to be a lot better at this than I am.</span> <span m='312000'>You can go and play\
  \ with this. Christine is going to try now.</span> <span m='317000'>Oh, look at\
  \ that. She is going to get it.</span> <span m='320000'>She is going to get it.\
  \ She is going to get it.</span> <span m='324000'>Yeah! [APPLAUSE] Three cheers\
  \ for</span> <span m='327000'>Christine. Oh, now it something else.</span> <span\
  \ m='334000'>This is going to keep going here.</span> <span m='339000'>You need\
  \ more power there. [LAUGHTER] Hey,</span> <span m='346000'>not that guy.</span>\
  \ <span m='359000'>Fantastic. All right.</span> <span m='361000'>And it is actually\
  \ just this effect that was used by Steve</span> <span m='367000'>Chu at Stanford\
  \ and Bill Phillips at NIST and Cohen and</span> <span m='373000'>Tanugi who provided\
  \ some of the theory behind it.</span> <span m='378000'>It is just that effect that\
  \ they used to literally trap an</span> <span m='384000'>atom in space. How do you\
  \ do that?</span> <span m='389000'>Well, you take an unsuspecting atom, and you\
  \ bring in a high</span> <span m='393000'>power laser beam coming out in this direction.</span>\
  \ <span m='397000'>And those photons transfer momentum, and they push that</span>\
  \ <span m='401000'>atom this way. But you are smarter than that,</span> <span m='404000'>so\
  \ you bring in a laser beam this way.</span> <span m='407000'>And so you have momentum\
  \ transfer this way and this way.</span> <span m='412000'>You just trapped the atom\
  \ in this dimension.</span> <span m='415000'>And then you bring in a laser beam\
  \ this way.</span> <span m='420000'>Bring in a laser beam that way. You have trapped\
  \ the atom now</span> <span m='424000'>in this dimension. What is that?</span> <span\
  \ m='427000'>Your dog. That is not part of my lecture.</span> <span m='430000'>[LAUGHTER]\
  \ And then you bring in the laser beam this way.</span> <span m='435000'>And so\
  \ now you have constrained in the three dimensions.</span> <span m='440000'>And\
  \ so the atom is trapped in space by this photon pressure,</span> <span m='444000'>by\
  \ this momentum transfer. And this is called laser</span> <span m='449000'>trapping.\
  \ And these three gentlemen,</span> <span m='453000'>whose names I gave you just\
  \ a moment ago, are laser atom</span> <span m='458000'>trapping and received a Nobel\
  \ Prize in 1997 for this</span> <span m='463000'>demonstration. But the other reason\
  \ why this</span> <span m='467000'>laser atom trapping was really so important is\
  \ because it is</span> <span m='472000'>actually the first step in another experiment.</span>\
  \ <span m='478000'>It is the first step in producing a Bose-Einstein</span> <span\
  \ m='482000'>condensate. What this laser trapping does</span> <span m='486000'>is\
  \ literally to slow the atom down or to cool the atom,</span> <span m='491000'>because\
  \ temperature and the velocity of the atom,</span> <span m='495000'>the speed of\
  \ the atom are related.</span> <span m='498000'>The slower the speed, the lower\
  \ the temperature.</span> <span m='502000'>And to produce a Bose-Einstein condensate,\
  \ you have to have</span> <span m='508000'>bosons, which you lower in temperature.</span>\
  \ <span m='513000'>And ultimately, they condense.</span> <span m='515000'>And the\
  \ temperatures have to be on the order of micro-Kelvin.</span> <span m='519000'>And\
  \ so this is the first step in producing that Bose-Einstein</span> <span m='524000'>condensate.\
  \ This will bring you down to</span> <span m='526000'>temperatures of, say, a Kelvin\
  \ or so.</span> <span m='529000'>And then there are lots of other techniques,</span>\
  \ <span m='532000'>a couple of other steps that bring you down to the</span> <span\
  \ m='536000'>microKelvin range. And then, finally,</span> <span m='539000'>you can\
  \ get the bosons to condense.</span> <span m='543000'>And one of my colleagues in\
  \ the Physics Department,</span> <span m='547000'>Wolfgang Ketterle, also received\
  \ the Nobel Prize</span> <span m='550000'>for the formation of the Bose-Einstein\
  \ condensate.</span> <span m='554000'>I actually think he is teaching a recitation\
  \ section in 8.01.</span> <span m='559000'>Maybe some of you have him. You do?</span>\
  \ <span m='562000'>No, you don't have him. Okay.</span> <span m='564000'>But you\
  \ will be able to meet him and talk to him.</span> <span m='570000'>Question? I'm\
  \ sorry.</span> <span m='572000'>Fantastic. Has he told you about this yet?</span>\
  \ <span m='576000'>Oh, he went to a conference. Okay.</span> <span m='580000'>Well,\
  \ you can imagine he is in demand.</span> <span m='584000'>But you will see him,\
  \ right?</span> <span m='588000'>I hope. Very important effect here.</span> <span\
  \ m='592000'>We have radiation that is exhibiting both wave-like</span> <span m='597000'>properties\
  \ and particle-like properties.</span> <span m='604000'>And, just in general, experiments\
  \ where the radiation</span> <span m='607000'>produces a change in the state of\
  \ the matter such as the</span> <span m='611000'>photoelectron effect. In photoelectron\
  \ effect,</span> <span m='614000'>the matter changes in the sense that an electron\
  \ is pulled off</span> <span m='619000'>of it. In those experiments,</span> <span\
  \ m='621000'>the radiation usually exhibits the particle-like behavior.</span> <span\
  \ m='626000'>In experiments where there is a change in the spatial</span> <span\
  \ m='630000'>distribution of the radiation, or where the radiation</span> <span\
  \ m='635000'>interaction results in a change in the spatial distribution of</span>\
  \ <span m='640000'>the radiation, that is when the radiation</span> <span m='643000'>exhibits\
  \ its wave-like behavior. And so it really is not</span> <span m='648000'>appropriate\
  \ to ask, is light or radiation a</span> <span m='652000'>particle or a wave? The\
  \ appropriate question to ask</span> <span m='656000'>is, how does light behave?\
  \ Does it behave like a particle</span> <span m='662000'>or does it behave like\
  \ a wave under particular experimental</span> <span m='667000'>circumstances? And\
  \ having both behaviors,</span> <span m='670000'>this wave-particle duality of radiation\
  \ is not a</span> <span m='674000'>contradiction. It just is the fundamental</span>\
  \ <span m='677000'>nature of radiation, of light.</span> <span m='680000'>You may\
  \ think it is a contradiction because in your</span> <span m='684000'>everyday experience,\
  \ you either see a wave or you</span> <span m='688000'>see a particle. But that\
  \ is your everyday</span> <span m='692000'>experience. And there are parts of nature</span>\
  \ <span m='695000'>that you cannot see every single day.</span> <span m='698000'>And\
  \ those deeper parts of nature have different rules.</span> <span m='702000'>And\
  \ you have to be accepting of those different rules.</span> <span m='706000'>And\
  \ so it is not a contradiction in terms.</span> <span m='709000'>It just seems strange\
  \ to you just because that isn't your</span> <span m='714000'>everyday experience.\
  \ It is the fundamental nature of</span> <span m='718000'>radiation. Well, not only\
  \ is that the</span> <span m='722000'>fundamental nature of radiation, but the wave-particle\
  \ duality</span> <span m='728000'>of matter is also the fundamental nature of matter.</span>\
  \ <span m='732000'>And that is what we are going to talk about right now.</span>\
  \ <span m='737000'>We are going to move to matter, particles.</span> <span m='754000'>The\
  \ particle-like nature of matter is within your everyday</span> <span m='759000'>experience,\
  \ but it is the wave-like nature of matter that</span> <span m='765000'>is not within\
  \ your everyday experience.</span> <span m='768000'>And so let's take a look at\
  \ that.</span> <span m='771000'>Suppose we did this experiment. That is, we had\
  \ a nickel</span> <span m='777000'>crystal. And these two atoms here are</span>\
  \ <span m='781000'>just two of the atoms on the surface of a nickel crystal.</span>\
  \ <span m='785000'>And we know the spacings between these two atoms in the</span>\
  \ <span m='789000'>crystal because we know the crystal structure of the nickel.</span>\
  \ <span m='793000'>That spacing is about 2x10^-10 meters.</span> <span m='796000'>Naively,\
  \ if you brought in a beam of electrons,</span> <span m='799000'>particles, and\
  \ we know they have mass.</span> <span m='802000'>J.J. Thompson taught us they were</span>\
  \ <span m='805000'>particles, they had mass. But, naively,</span> <span m='808000'>if\
  \ you brought them in, you might expect these</span> <span m='812000'>electrons\
  \ to scatter isotropically.</span> <span m='814000'>That is that they would scatter\
  \ equally in all directions so</span> <span m='819000'>that when they ultimately\
  \ hit this screen here,</span> <span m='822000'>this curved phosphor screen, and\
  \ I changed the geometry here</span> <span m='827000'>to a curved screen just so\
  \ that it will be a little bit easier</span> <span m='832000'>to analyze the geometry\
  \ of this problem, which we are going to</span> <span m='836000'>do in a moment,\
  \ you might expect this screen to</span> <span m='840000'>be lit up uniformly at\
  \ all angles.</span> <span m='844000'>Well, this is exactly the experiment that\
  \ Davidson and</span> <span m='849000'>Germer did in 1927, along with this gentleman,</span>\
  \ <span m='853000'>G. Thompson, George Thompson,</span> <span m='855000'>son of\
  \ J.J. Thompson.</span> <span m='857000'>And J.J. Thompson actually did an</span>\
  \ <span m='860000'>experiment a little different than Davidson and Germer.</span>\
  \ <span m='865000'>I am going to show you the Davidson and Germer experiment</span>\
  \ <span m='871000'>here. But here is the same diagram</span> <span m='875000'>that\
  \ I had before, except that I made the nickel</span> <span m='878000'>atoms a little\
  \ bit smaller just so that this diagram would be a</span> <span m='883000'>little\
  \ bit easier to understand. I cleaned up the diagram,</span> <span m='888000'>but\
  \ kept the spacing between the two nickel atoms the same.</span> <span m='892000'>And\
  \ so Davidson, Germer and Thompson came in,</span> <span m='896000'>scattered these\
  \ electrons and looked how they scattered back.</span> <span m='902000'>And, lo\
  \ and behold, what they saw is that these</span> <span m='906000'>electrons seemed\
  \ to scatter back at a preferential angle.</span> <span m='911000'>The angular distribution\
  \ was not isotropic.</span> <span m='915000'>Instead, it looked like the electrons\
  \ scattered back at a</span> <span m='920000'>pretty well-defined angle here, 50.7\
  \ degrees.</span> <span m='924000'>And not only did they scatter back at that angle,</span>\
  \ <span m='928000'>they also scattered right back at themselves.</span> <span m='934000'>Backscattered\
  \ this way, so this scattering angle is</span> <span m='937000'>zero degrees. And\
  \ under some particular</span> <span m='940000'>conditions, the electrons also scattered\
  \ at a larger angle,</span> <span m='945000'>here. But the bottom line is that the</span>\
  \ <span m='948000'>scattering pattern was not isotropic.</span> <span m='951000'>There\
  \ was a bright spot, lots of electrons scattered at</span> <span m='955000'>this\
  \ angle, a dark spot, no electrons scattered at this</span> <span m='959000'>angle.\
  \ A bright spot,</span> <span m='962000'>dark spot, bright spot. This looks like\
  \ interference</span> <span m='967000'>phenomena, just like the two slit experiment.</span>\
  \ <span m='972000'>Bright spot, dark spot, bright spot,</span> <span m='975000'>constructive,\
  \ destructive,</span> <span m='978000'>constructive interference, back and forth.</span>\
  \ <span m='982000'>That was their observation. How do we understand that?</span>\
  \ <span m='987000'>Well, it is looking like these electrons are behaving like</span>\
  \ <span m='993000'>waves. Suppose these electrons are</span> <span m='998000'>coming\
  \ in, so we have this constant stream of electrons</span> <span m='1003000'>impinging\
  \ on our nickel crystal. Well, what is happening here is</span> <span m='1008000'>that\
  \ when these electrons are reflecting back from the</span> <span m='1013000'>individual\
  \ nickel atoms, these individual nickel atoms</span> <span m='1017000'>are kind\
  \ of functioning like those little slits we saw in the</span> <span m='1023000'>two\
  \ slit experiment. That is, they are scattering</span> <span m='1028000'>back as\
  \ a wave. These electrons seem to be</span> <span m='1031000'>scattering as a wave,\
  \ so isotropically in all</span> <span m='1035000'>directions. This semicircle around\
  \ each one</span> <span m='1039000'>of the atoms, and I only show you two atoms</span>\
  \ <span m='1042000'>here, each semicircle is the maximum of the wave front.</span>\
  \ <span m='1047000'>It is the crest of the wave front.</span> <span m='1051000'>And\
  \ then, as time goes by, of course, these waves</span> <span m='1055000'>propagate\
  \ out. And then another wave front,</span> <span m='1059000'>another wave maximum\
  \ appears and a distance between these two</span> <span m='1065000'>maxima is, of\
  \ course, the wavelength.</span> <span m='1069000'>And as time goes on, they scatter\
  \ further.</span> <span m='1073000'>And as time goes on, they still scatter.</span>\
  \ <span m='1078000'>And they keep the propagating out until they reach the screen.</span>\
  \ <span m='1082000'>And, lo and behold, on the screen you see a bright</span> <span\
  \ m='1086000'>spot, dark spot, bright spot,</span> <span m='1088000'>dark spot.\
  \ Interference pattern.</span> <span m='1090000'>Let's analyze this. Here is the\
  \ diagram again.</span> <span m='1094000'>I just moved it over and cleaned it up\
  \ again.</span> <span m='1097000'>I want you to look at this spot right in there.</span>\
  \ <span m='1101000'>That is where we have the maximum of a wave scattered from</span>\
  \ <span m='1105000'>atom one at the same point in space as the maximum of waves</span>\
  \ <span m='1109000'>scattered from atom two. Constructive interference.</span> <span\
  \ m='1114000'>Here is another point of constructive interference.</span> <span m='1118000'>Here\
  \ is another point of constructive interference.</span> <span m='1122000'>Everywhere\
  \ along this line, we have constructive</span> <span m='1125000'>interference, which\
  \ results in a large</span> <span m='1128000'>intensity right at this scattering\
  \ angle here,</span> <span m='1131000'>a bright spot. And we already know the</span>\
  \ <span m='1134000'>condition for constructive interference.</span> <span m='1138000'>That\
  \ is, in order to get this constructive interference,</span> <span m='1141000'>the\
  \ difference in the distance traveled by the two waves that</span> <span m='1145000'>are\
  \ interfering has to be an integral multiple of the</span> <span m='1149000'>wavelength\
  \ lambda. Now, I use the term d instead</span> <span m='1152000'>of r, but it is\
  \ the same thing for the condition for</span> <span m='1156000'>constructive interference,\
  \ here.</span> <span m='1158000'>And if you went and analyzed what the difference\
  \ in the</span> <span m='1162000'>distance was for this constructive interference\
  \ along</span> <span m='1165000'>this line, you would find it was n equals 1.</span>\
  \ <span m='1170000'>The difference in the distance traveled is one lambda.</span>\
  \ <span m='1173000'>And, if you looked at the points of constructive</span> <span\
  \ m='1176000'>interference along this line that led to this bright spot,</span>\
  \ <span m='1180000'>the difference in the distance traveled will be two lambda.</span>\
  \ <span m='1184000'>This is our second-order interference feature,</span> <span\
  \ m='1187000'>our second-order diffraction spot.</span> <span m='1189000'>And, if\
  \ you look at it along the center here,</span> <span m='1192000'>normal to the crystal,\
  \ that would be the zero-order</span> <span m='1195000'>spot. d2 minus d1 is equal\
  \ to zero</span> <span m='1197000'>lambda.</span> <span m='1201000'>All right. That\
  \ is what looks like is</span> <span m='1204000'>happening. Now, what we are going\
  \ to do is</span> <span m='1208000'>we are going to actually analyze this geometry\
  \ a bit more.</span> <span m='1213000'>We didn't do so in the two slit experiment.</span>\
  \ <span m='1217000'>We could have. We didn't.</span> <span m='1219000'>We are going\
  \ to do it here. And what we are going to be</span> <span m='1224000'>after is if\
  \ these electrons are acting like waves,</span> <span m='1229000'>then they have\
  \ a wavelength. And we want to know what the</span> <span m='1235000'>wavelength\
  \ is. Davidson and Germer wanted to</span> <span m='1238000'>know what the wavelength\
  \ was. And we are going to use this</span> <span m='1242000'>scattering angle here,\
  \ theta.</span> <span m='1244000'>This angle from the normal to where the electrons\
  \ are</span> <span m='1247000'>scattering, that angle theta, we are going to use\
  \ that</span> <span m='1251000'>information, theta equals 50.7 degrees, to back\
  \ out the</span> <span m='1255000'>wavelength. And we know what the condition</span>\
  \ <span m='1258000'>is for constructive interference.</span> <span m='1262000'>We\
  \ just talked about it. Here it is, d2 minus d1.</span> <span m='1267000'>That is\
  \ the wavelength we are</span> <span m='1270000'>after in this analysis. Now, what\
  \ is d2 here?</span> <span m='1274000'>Well, the length of this line, d2, is the\
  \ distance that the</span> <span m='1279000'>wave that scatters from electron two\
  \ travels from electron two to</span> <span m='1286000'>the screen. d1 is the distance\
  \ that the</span> <span m='1289000'>wave that scatters from atom one travels to\
  \ the screen.</span> <span m='1296000'>That is what d2 and d1 are, here.</span>\
  \ <span m='1299000'>Now, I am going to draw a perpendicular from atom one to</span>\
  \ <span m='1304000'>this line d2. There is my right angle.</span> <span m='1307000'>Now,\
  \ you can see, then, that this leg of the</span> <span m='1311000'>triangle is d2\
  \ minus d1, the difference in the</span> <span m='1317000'>distance traveled. That\
  \ is this quantity here.</span> <span m='1322000'>That is going to be important.\
  \ Now, you have got to convince</span> <span m='1326000'>yourself that this angle\
  \ right here in the triangle is the same</span> <span m='1331000'>as this scattering\
  \ angle. You can convince yourself of</span> <span m='1335000'>that pretty easily.\
  \ Now we have a well-defined</span> <span m='1338000'>triangle. We know one length\
  \ of it,</span> <span m='1341000'>we have measured the angle theta, and d2 minus\
  \ d1</span> <span m='1345000'>is something that we would like to know.</span> <span\
  \ m='1350000'>Let's do a little geometry. The sine of theta,</span> <span m='1353000'>the\
  \ sign of this angle is equal to the opposite length,</span> <span m='1357000'>which\
  \ is d2 minus d1, divided by A,</span> <span m='1360000'>this distance between the\
  \ two atoms in the nickel crystal.</span> <span m='1364000'>We have two equations.</span>\
  \ <span m='1368000'>This is the equation that in theory should obtain for</span>\
  \ <span m='1372000'>constructive interference. This is the equation that we</span>\
  \ <span m='1377000'>set up given the particular physical geometry of our</span>\
  \ <span m='1381000'>problem. These two (d2 minus d1)'s</span> <span m='1385000'>better\
  \ be equal to each other. We have n lambda is A sine</span> <span m='1391000'>theta.</span>\
  \ <span m='1394000'>Let's solve for lambda. We can do that.</span> <span m='1398000'>That\
  \ is A sine theta over n. We already know what theta is,</span> <span m='1403000'>we\
  \ know what A is, so what is n?</span> <span m='1408000'>Well, n is going to be\
  \ one because this is the bright spot</span> <span m='1413000'>that is closest to\
  \ the zero-order spot,</span> <span m='1416000'>which is always present at the normal\
  \ angle there if you are</span> <span m='1422000'>coming in at normal orientation.\
  \ So n is equal 1 so I can plug</span> <span m='1427000'>things in. And, when I\
  \ do that,</span> <span m='1430000'>I find that the wavelength that I predict is\
  \ 1.66x10^-10 meters.</span> <span m='1436000'>We've got this wavelength. Now, before\
  \ I go on,</span> <span m='1441000'>I just want to point out that this geometry\
  \ of the problem</span> <span m='1447000'>that I set up here is identical to the\
  \ geometry in a technique</span> <span m='1453000'>known as X-ray diffraction. X-ray\
  \ diffraction does not use</span> <span m='1458000'>electrons coming in, but uses\
  \ X-rays,</span> <span m='1461000'>photons. And it is a technique that is</span>\
  \ <span m='1465000'>going to be important to you if you do any kind of science</span>\
  \ <span m='1470000'>involving materials or biological systems.</span> <span m='1476000'>And\
  \ it is important because X-ray diffraction allows you to</span> <span m='1480000'>determine\
  \ the structure, in particular of proteins,</span> <span m='1484000'>crystal proteins.\
  \ You crystallize the protein,</span> <span m='1488000'>and you use this X-ray diffraction\
  \ to get out the</span> <span m='1492000'>structure. And the reason why you want\
  \ the</span> <span m='1495000'>structure of the proteins is because the structure\
  \ gives you</span> <span m='1500000'>a hint as to what the function of the proteins\
  \ are.</span> <span m='1506000'>And so in the use of X-ray diffraction, we don't\
  \ go and</span> <span m='1511000'>calculate what lambda is. We already know what\
  \ lambda is</span> <span m='1516000'>in X-ray diffraction. We know the wavelength\
  \ of the</span> <span m='1521000'>incident photons, the X-rays.</span> <span m='1525000'>What\
  \ we don't know in the technique of X-ray diffraction</span> <span m='1530000'>is\
  \ the distance between the atoms in an unknown structure.</span> <span m='1536000'>And\
  \ so in X-ray diffraction, we know the wavelength,</span> <span m='1541000'>and\
  \ we can figure out what order it is and we measure the</span> <span m='1546000'>scattering\
  \ angle. And we use that to determine</span> <span m='1551000'>the distance between\
  \ the atoms. And, in that way,</span> <span m='1555000'>we back out the structure\
  \ of the sample.</span> <span m='1567000'>Yes. We are just going to get there.</span>\
  \ <span m='1570000'>We are going to do that. All right.</span> <span m='1573000'>Same\
  \ geometry here. Now, this experiment of</span> <span m='1577000'>Davidson and Germer\
  \ was really an important one because just</span> <span m='1583000'>three years\
  \ before this, there was a prediction for what</span> <span m='1588000'>the wavelength\
  \ of particles ought to be.</span> <span m='1593000'>And that prediction was made\
  \ by this gentleman,</span> <span m='1598000'>Louis de Broglie. In his Ph.D.</span>\
  \ <span m='1602000'>thesis, no less, what Mr.</span> <span m='1605000'>de Broglie\
  \ did was that he looked at the relativistic</span> <span m='1611000'>equations\
  \ of motion that Einstein wrote down and used to</span> <span m='1618000'>propose\
  \ that a photon or radiation with a wavelength</span> <span m='1624000'>lambda had\
  \ momentum p. Well, he took those same</span> <span m='1631000'>equations and said,\
  \ well, these relativistic</span> <span m='1636000'>equations of motion apply to\
  \ matter just as well as they</span> <span m='1642000'>apply to radiation. Therefore,\
  \ if you have</span> <span m='1647000'>radiation with a wavelength lambda, you then\
  \ have this</span> <span m='1655000'>momentum p for the radiation. This is what\
  \ Einstein said.</span> <span m='1662000'>But he turned it around and said, if you\
  \ have matter with a</span> <span m='1670000'>momentum p, well, that matter ought\
  \ to have a</span> <span m='1676000'>wavelength lambda. He turned around Einstein's</span>\
  \ <span m='1683000'>equations of motion and proposed that the wavelength of a</span>\
  \ <span m='1689000'>particle be given by h over p where, of course,</span> <span\
  \ m='1695000'>p here is the mass times the velocity.</span> <span m='1699000'>Fantastic.</span>\
  \ <span m='1704000'>What a great Ph.D. thesis.</span> <span m='1707000'>I'm impressed.\
  \ Now, let's see how well,</span> <span m='1712000'>as you can imagine, that predicts\
  \ the wavelength</span> <span m='1718000'>that Davidson and Germer actually measured.</span>\
  \ <span m='1723000'>We know we have 54 electrons coming into this nickel crystal.</span>\
  \ <span m='1730000'>That is their kinetic energy, one-half m v squared.</span> <span\
  \ m='1737000'>Kinetic energy can also be</span> <span m='1742000'>written in terms\
  \ of the momentum.</span> <span m='1745000'>The momentum is p square over 2m.</span>\
  \ <span m='1748000'>You can convince yourself of this.</span> <span m='1753000'>This\
  \ is a good thing to know for doing these problems,</span> <span m='1758000'>that\
  \ the kinetic energy is p squared over 2 times the mass of</span> <span m='1763000'>the\
  \ electron. And so if you solve that,</span> <span m='1767000'>what you get for\
  \ the momentum of the electrons is 4.0x10^-24</span> <span m='1772000'>kilograms\
  \ meters per second. And now I can take this</span> <span m='1780000'>momentum and\
  \ plug it into the expression for de Broglie's</span> <span m='1787000'>wavelength,\
  \ 6.6x10^-34 joule seconds, over the momentum,</span> <span m='1795000'>4x10^-24.\
  \ What do I get?</span> <span m='1798000'>1.7x10^-10 meters. Absolutely the same\
  \ as the</span> <span m='1805000'>experiment. De Broglie made a prediction.</span>\
  \ <span m='1810000'>A few years after that, experiments demonstrated that</span>\
  \ <span m='1817000'>de Broglie was absolutely correct in his prediction.</span>\
  \ <span m='1824000'>What do we have here? We have matter,</span> <span m='1829000'>particles,\
  \ exhibiting wave-like behavior.</span> <span m='1833000'>And, those particles can\
  \ be measured to have a wavelength</span> <span m='1838000'>that actually agrees\
  \ with a prediction, some theory,</span> <span m='1843000'>the de Broglie wavelength.\
  \ And we also have another</span> <span m='1848000'>phenomena here, which I really\
  \ enjoy,</span> <span m='1851000'>and that is Davidson and Germer and George Thompson.</span>\
  \ <span m='1856000'>They demonstrated that electrons behave like waves.</span> <span\
  \ m='1863000'>And what did J.J. Thompson do,</span> <span m='1866000'>father of\
  \ George Thompson, well, he demonstrated that an</span> <span m='1871000'>electron\
  \ was a particle. Here, we have both the father</span> <span m='1877000'>and the\
  \ son talking about seemingly opposite behavior,</span> <span m='1883000'>but they\
  \ are both right. How often does that happen?</span> <span m='1888000'>That, I think,\
  \ is really amazing.</span> <span m='1893000'>But if matter is wave-like and if\
  \ electrons can be represented</span> <span m='1900000'>by a wavelength, then what\
  \ about your</span> <span m='1905000'>wavelengths and my wavelengths? We should\
  \ have a wavelength.</span> <span m='1913000'>And we do. And just briefly,</span>\
  \ <span m='1916000'>here, let's talk about what the wavelength is of a baseball</span>\
  \ <span m='1924000'>pitched by Curt Shilling at 90 mph.</span> <span m='1930000'>What\
  \ is that wavelength? Well, a baseball is five</span> <span m='1935000'>ounces.\
  \ 90 mph.</span> <span m='1937000'>You can calculate the momentum. It is in your\
  \ notes there.</span> <span m='1943000'>We will calculate, here, the wavelength.</span>\
  \ <span m='1949000'>And what you are going to find is that it is 1.2x10^-34 meters.</span>\
  \ <span m='1955000'>That is pretty small. What is the diameter of a</span> <span\
  \ m='1959000'>nucleus? 10^-14, right.</span> <span m='1962000'>That is a good number\
  \ to know. Here, we have a wavelength that</span> <span m='1968000'>is 10^-34 meters.\
  \ Is that wavelength of a</span> <span m='1972000'>macroscopic size object going\
  \ to have any consequence in our</span> <span m='1978000'>world? No, absolutely\
  \ not.</span> <span m='1981000'>Why? Because in order to see any</span> <span m='1984000'>effects\
  \ from this small wavelength, we are going to have</span> <span m='1990000'>to have\
  \ slits or atoms that are going to be on the order of this</span> <span m='1996000'>close\
  \ together. But there is no way that we are</span> <span m='2000000'>going to have\
  \ two nickel atoms that are this close together or</span> <span m='2006000'>two\
  \ slits in a two slit experiment this close together.</span> <span m='2013000'>And\
  \ so for macroscopic objects, the wavelike properties have no</span> <span m='2020000'>consequence\
  \ in this world. And that is simply because the</span> <span m='2027000'>mass is\
  \ too large. It makes the wavelength too</span> <span m='2033000'>small to have\
  \ any effects in our everyday lives.</span> <span m='2039000'>And it is actually\
  \ -- Yes?</span> <span m='2044000'>Okay.</span> <span m='2055000'>Well, they are\
  \ actually coming in as waves.</span> <span m='2059000'>They are behaving as waves.\
  \ Remember my beach picture?</span> <span m='2065000'>I drew them coming in like\
  \ a circle.</span> <span m='2070000'>But remember my picture of this barrier here\
  \ on the beach,</span> <span m='2076000'>and I am laying here on the sand, and then\
  \ the waves are</span> <span m='2082000'>coming in? Here is blue.</span> <span m='2084000'>These\
  \ electrons, as they are coming in,</span> <span m='2088000'>really need to be thought\
  \ of as these kind of plane waves.</span> <span m='2094000'>I drew them as kind\
  \ of just particles.</span> <span m='2100000'>But you have to really think of them\
  \ as plane waves and that</span> <span m='2105000'>they are reflecting off of these\
  \ two atoms in the way that I just</span> <span m='2111000'>explained. Another question?</span>\
  \ <span m='2125000'>The thing is that you cannot get that velocity slow enough to</span>\
  \ <span m='2129000'>make the wavelength large enough to be of consequence.</span>\
  \ <span m='2133000'>If you could then you would, right?</span> <span m='2136000'>You\
  \ would see the wave-like behavior.</span> <span m='2138000'>But you cannot, practically\
  \ speaking,</span> <span m='2141000'>get it to that extent.</span> <span m='2178000'>No.\
  \ In this particular case,</span> <span m='2180000'>anything that is so massive,\
  \ any smaller effects,</span> <span m='2184000'>like what you are talking about,\
  \ exactly the point of</span> <span m='2188000'>observation is not going to have\
  \ an effect on anything that is so</span> <span m='2193000'>massive. Pardon?</span>\
  \ <span m='2195000'>Yes, your point of observation will have an effect on your</span>\
  \ <span m='2201000'>interpretation of the experiment, if you are talking</span>\
  \ <span m='2206000'>about something that has a much larger wavelength.</span> <span\
  \ m='2211000'>Absolutely. In high energy physics</span> <span m='2215000'>experiments,\
  \ for example. Good question.</span> <span m='2225000'>It is just this observation,\
  \ here, of the wave-like behavior</span> <span m='2234000'>of electrons, of particles,</span>\
  \ <span m='2239000'>that led to the interpretation, then, or led to the realization</span>\
  \ <span m='2249000'>that maybe, you have to treat electrons as waves.</span> <span\
  \ m='2259000'>Or maybe you have to treat the behavior of electrons as</span> <span\
  \ m='2268000'>wave-like behavior. And that is what this gentleman</span> <span m='2276000'>Schr\u02C6\
  dinger did. He said, well,</span> <span m='2281000'>you know what? This gave him\
  \ an idea.</span> <span m='2285000'>Maybe what is wrong is that an electron in an\
  \ atom,</span> <span m='2290000'>I cannot treat that electron as a particle.</span>\
  \ <span m='2294000'>Instead, what I have to do is treat is as a wave.</span> <span\
  \ m='2299000'>I have to treat its wave-like properties.</span> <span m='2303000'>And\
  \ it was that impetus that led him to write down a wave</span> <span m='2308000'>equation\
  \ of motion. An equation of motion for</span> <span m='2314000'>waves. He realized,</span>\
  \ <span m='2316000'>or he was guessing at the moment, well,</span> <span m='2320000'>maybe\
  \ in the case when a microscopic particle has a</span> <span m='2326000'>wavelength\
  \ that is on the order of the size of its environment,</span> <span m='2333000'>in\
  \ that case, maybe the wavelength has an</span> <span m='2337000'>effect, makes\
  \ a difference. For example,</span> <span m='2342000'>in the case of the electrons,\
  \ we had a wavelength calculated,</span> <span m='2347000'>there, of 1.7x10^-10\
  \ meters. That is a wavelength that is on</span> <span m='2352000'>the order of\
  \ the size of the environment of the electron,</span> <span m='2356000'>which is\
  \ on the order of the size of an atom.</span> <span m='2360000'>Maybe in that case\
  \ I have to pay attention to the wavelength.</span> <span m='2364000'>The reason\
  \ you and I don't have to pay any attention to our</span> <span m='2369000'>wavelength\
  \ is because our wavelength is 10^-30 meters or</span> <span m='2373000'>so. And\
  \ that is much,</span> <span m='2376000'>much larger than the size of the environment.</span>\
  \ <span m='2380000'>In this case, we don't have to pay any</span> <span m='2384000'>attention\
  \ to our wavelength. But, for an electron in an</span> <span m='2389000'>atom, we\
  \ have a problem, here.</span> <span m='2391000'>What did Schr\u02C6dinger do? Schr\u02C6\
  dinger said,</span> <span m='2395000'>I have to write down a wave equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='2400000'>An equation of motion for matter waves.</span> <span m='2405000'>And\
  \ what is that equation of motion?</span> <span m='2410000'>Well, that equation\
  \ of motion is H hat operating on Psi,</span> <span m='2419000'>and it gives us\
  \ back an energy, E, times a Psi.</span> <span m='2425000'>What is this? Well, Psi,\
  \ here,</span> <span m='2430000'>is a wave. I am somehow going to let my</span>\
  \ <span m='2434000'>electron in an atom be represented by Psi.</span> <span m='2437000'>This\
  \ is going to be a wave form.</span> <span m='2440000'>This is going to be a wave\
  \ function.</span> <span m='2443000'>I am going to let my electron be represented\
  \ by the wave</span> <span m='2449000'>function. Exactly how it is going to be</span>\
  \ <span m='2452000'>represented by the wave function is something that I am not\
  \ going</span> <span m='2458000'>to tell you quite yet. But it is going to represent</span>\
  \ <span m='2466000'>the electron. This energy,</span> <span m='2470000'>here, that\
  \ energy is going to turn out to be the binding</span> <span m='2478000'>energy\
  \ of the electron in the atom.</span> <span m='2483000'>This thing, here, is called\
  \ the Hamiltonian</span> <span m='2490000'>Operator. That Hamiltonian Operator is</span>\
  \ <span m='2495000'>specific to a particular problem, and we will look at the</span>\
  \ <span m='2501000'>Hamiltonian Operator for a hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='2505000'>But\
  \ this operator is operating on Psi, and it gives you back a</span> <span m='2510000'>Psi,\
  \ the same function, multiplied by a constant.</span> <span m='2515000'>That constant\
  \ is the binding energy.</span> <span m='2520000'>Now, you think, well, let me just\
  \ cancel this</span> <span m='2524000'>and this. But you cannot do that because</span>\
  \ <span m='2528000'>this is an operator. This has some derivatives in</span> <span\
  \ m='2533000'>it. Its operating on Psi gives you</span> <span m='2537000'>back the\
  \ same function times the constant.</span> <span m='2541000'>Now, how did Schr\u02C6\
  dinger actually derive this equation,</span> <span m='2547000'>so to speak? Well,\
  \ what he did was to just</span> <span m='2554000'>guess at a wave function. We\
  \ are going to use a</span> <span m='2560000'>one-dimensional wave function. He\
  \ is going to say,</span> <span m='2567000'>let me represent my electron by Psi\
  \ of x equal to 2 a times</span> <span m='2575000'>cosine 2 pi x over lambda.</span>\
  \ <span m='2582000'>That is going to be my wave</span> <span m='2589000'>function.\
  \ Why not?</span> <span m='2591000'>And then he said, well, what I really need here</span>\
  \ <span m='2599000'>is an equation of motion. I need to know how Psi changes</span>\
  \ <span m='2607000'>with x. If you wanted an equation of</span> <span m='2612000'>motion,\
  \ if you wanted to know how Psi changes with x,</span> <span m='2617000'>what would\
  \ you do to Psi? Take the derivative.</span> <span m='2621000'>Let's take a derivative\
  \ of Psi of x, with respect to x.</span> <span m='2626000'>That is going to be equal\
  \ to minus 2 a</span> <span m='2631000'>times 2 pi over lambda times sine of 2pi\
  \ x over lambda.</span> <span m='2643000'>That is an equation of motion. Now, this\
  \ is actually kind of</span> <span m='2647000'>an equation of position. But it is\
  \ telling us how Psi</span> <span m='2650000'>changes with x.</span> <span m='2660000'>But\
  \ now, since that gave us some information about how Psi</span> <span m='2668000'>changes\
  \ with x, how would we get the rate of</span> <span m='2674000'>change of Psi with\
  \ x? Second derivative.</span> <span m='2679000'>Let's take the second derivative\
  \ of that.</span> <span m='2683000'>Second derivative of Psi of x with respect to\
  \ x,</span> <span m='2687000'>that is minus 2a times 4 pi squared over lambda squared</span>\
  \ <span m='2692000'>times cosine 2pi x over lambda.</span> <span m='2702000'>That's\
  \ pretty good, but now, what do you see in</span> <span m='2707000'>this equation?\
  \ Psi.</span> <span m='2709000'>You see what I started with. It is recursive,</span>\
  \ <span m='2714000'>right. You see the Psi of x here.</span> <span m='2719000'>Let\
  \ me write that equation in</span> <span m='2723000'>terms of the original function.\
  \ Second derivative of Psi of x</span> <span m='2731000'>with respect to x, minus\
  \ 2pi over lambda squared</span> <span m='2736000'>times Psi of x.</span> <span\
  \ m='2741000'>lambda)^2 Psi(x)** That is pretty good.</span> <span m='2745000'>You\
  \ know where I am trying to go?</span> <span m='2749000'>I am trying to derive,\
  \ so to speak,</span> <span m='2753000'>Schr\u02C6dinger's equation. See, it is\
  \ not very hard.</span> <span m='2760000'>Yes. Now, this equation right here,</span>\
  \ <span m='2763000'>this equation is just a classical wave equation.</span> <span\
  \ m='2768000'>The only thing I have done so far is take derivatives.</span> <span\
  \ m='2774000'>I have done nothing else. I just took derivatives.</span> <span m='2779000'>It\
  \ could represent any kind of wave.</span> <span m='2783000'>There is nothing quantum\
  \ mechanical about it.</span> <span m='2789000'>But here comes the big leap that\
  \ Schr\u02C6dinger made.</span> <span m='2796000'>He substituted in here for lambda\
  \ the momentum of the</span> <span m='2803000'>particle. In other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='2807000'>if this is a wave equation and that wave has some wavelength,</span>\
  \ <span m='2815000'>here, lambda. He said, well,</span> <span m='2820000'>if this\
  \ is a wave equation for a matter wave,</span> <span m='2824000'>well, then I better\
  \ get the momentum of that particle in</span> <span m='2830000'>this wave. And he\
  \ knew how to do that</span> <span m='2834000'>because de Broglie told him how to\
  \ do that.</span> <span m='2838000'>De Broglie said, lambda is equal to h over p.</span>\
  \ <span m='2842000'>That is pretty good.</span> <span m='2846000'>What can I do\
  \ here? Well, what I can do is I can</span> <span m='2852000'>rearrange this and\
  \ write this in terms of the momentum of the</span> <span m='2858000'>particle.\
  \ Second derivative of Psi of x</span> <span m='2862000'>with respect to x is going\
  \ to be minus p squared over h bar</span> <span m='2868000'>squared times Psi of\
  \ x.</span> <span m='2873000'>Now, let me explain what h bar here is</span> <span\
  \ m='2878000'>h bar is a shorthand way of</span> <span m='2882000'>writing h over\
  \ 2pi. If you</span> <span m='2887000'>don't know it already, you should know it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2891000'>You are going to need it. That is h over 2pi,</span> <span m='2895000'>so\
  \ this is h bar squared. Now, what do I have?</span> <span m='2899000'>Now I have\
  \ a matter wave. I have an equation of motion.</span> <span m='2904000'>I have something\
  \ that tells me how Psi moves with respect to X.</span> <span m='2912000'>The rate\
  \ of change of Psi with X.</span> <span m='2915000'>And I had the momentum of the\
  \ particle buried in here.</span> <span m='2920000'>From this form, I am going to\
  \ get to that.</span> <span m='2924115'>And I guess I am going to get to that next\
  \ Wednesday.</span> </p>"
