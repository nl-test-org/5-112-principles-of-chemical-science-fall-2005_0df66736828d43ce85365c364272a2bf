  information about our license and MIT Open</span> <span m='10000'>Courseware in
  general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>A very simply
  little demonstration.</span> </p><p><span m='17000'>And I would like you to take
  a look at the two materials that</span> <span m='21000'>are in the two vials I have
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='24000'>One of these that I am taping is a beige-colored
  solid,</span> <span m='28000'>and it is iron dichloride, ferrous chloride.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31000'>And then over here, I have an organic molecule that</span>
  <span m='35000'>is colorless, just white.</span> </p><p><span m='36000'>And what
  I am going to do is first make a solution of the</span> <span m='40000'>ferrous
  chloride in water.</span> </p><p><span m='49000'>I am just using a very small amount.</span>
  </p><p><span m='51000'>And what you will see is that the FeCl two dissolves</span>
  <span m='55000'>up pretty nicely in water, and it gives a solution that</span> <span
  m='59000'>has very little color to it. You might be able to see that</span> <span
  m='64000'>it looks maybe pale yellow. Can you see that?</span> </p><p><span m='68000'>Okay.
  To that solution of ferrous</span> <span m='71000'>chloride in water, I am now going
  to add this</span> <span m='75000'>organic molecule. I will draw the molecule for</span>
  <span m='79000'>you before we finish today. And I am just going to add a</span>
  <span m='84000'>small amount of this colorless organic molecule --</span> <span
  m='95000'>-- to get a very nice intense red color in the aqueous</span> <span m='100000'>solution.
  And the person I am going to be</span> <span m='104000'>talking about today is the
  one who really figured out what is</span> <span m='110000'>going on in a reaction
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='113000'>And this was a great mystery for a long
  period of time,</span> <span m='118000'>until Alfred Werner came along.</span> </p><p><span
  m='137000'>I would encourage you while you are at home, perhaps,</span> <span m='141000'>or
  visiting friends over this coming weekend,</span> <span m='144000'>to go onto the
  Internet and go to the Nobel Prize website,</span> <span m='149000'>where you can
  read a very nice short bibliography of Alfred</span> <span m='153000'>Werner, because
  he won the Nobel Prize in 1913.</span> </p><p><span m='164000'>And he won this prize
  based on a theory that he developed</span> <span m='169000'>stemming from observations
  he made regarding reactions of</span> <span m='175000'>metal salts with various
  substances.</span> </p><p><span m='179000'>And I am going to point out initially,
  here,</span> <span m='183000'>that he studied the reaction of cobalt three chloride.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190000'>I just used iron dichloride. This is cobalt trichloride</span>
  <span m='196000'>reacting with six equivalents of ammonia.</span> </p><p><span m='203000'>And
  he observed that if to aqueous solution of cobalt</span> <span m='210000'>trichloride
  was added six equivalence of NH three,</span> <span m='217000'>ammonia, followed
  by silver nitrate, that that resulted in</span> <span m='225000'>no AgCl precipitate.
  And that is rather astounding.</span> </p><p><span m='232000'>Sorry. We will get
  to "no,"</span> <span m='235000'>but this one is "all." How does he do this experiment?</span>
  </p><p><span m='241000'>He just puts these things in solution, adds silver nitrate,</span>
  <span m='245000'>and either there is or is not a precipitative silver chloride,</span>
  <span m='249000'>which is very insoluble. And that precipitate can be</span> <span
  m='252000'>collected by filtration, dried, and then weighed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256000'>And then, in comparison with the mass of the added</span> <span m='259000'>substances,
  you would know how much of the chloride that was</span> <span m='262000'>put into
  the reaction actually came out as insoluble silver</span> <span m='266000'>chloride
  precipitate. And he did a series of</span> <span m='271000'>experiments. And so,
  if he uses cobalt</span> <span m='276000'>trichloride and less ammonia, namely five
  equivalents of</span> <span m='283000'>ammonia, then he finds that that leads instead
  to two-thirds of</span> <span m='291000'>the possible AgCl precipitate. And continuing
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='304000'>If he uses now only four equivalence of ammonia,</span>
  <span m='310000'>then the addition of silver nitrate provides one-third of</span>
  <span m='317000'>the possible of the total precipitated chloride.</span> </p><p><span
  m='323000'>And then, finally, if he drops down the number of</span> <span m='329000'>equivalents
  of ammonia to three, then we get none,</span> <span m='335000'>zero of the AgCl
  precipitating. And a further observation,</span> <span m='343000'>to add to these
  four observations,</span> <span m='346000'>was that in no case, here, did the solution
  give a</span> <span m='350000'>reaction with hydrogen chloride. What is the significance
  of</span> <span m='355000'>that? Hydrogen chloride,</span> <span m='357000'>of course,
  is a strong Bronsted acid.</span> </p><p><span m='362000'>And, if you have a base
  in solution, it should react with</span> <span m='366000'>that Bronsted acid. And
  what are we adding here?</span> </p><p><span m='369000'>We are adding ammonia. And
  ammonia is a base,</span> <span m='372000'>isn't it? But when you do the experiment</span>
  <span m='375000'>like this and then test for any reactivity with hydrogen</span>
  <span m='379000'>chloride, there is no reactivity with hydrogen chloride.</span>
  </p><p><span m='383000'>So what is going on? And, secondly,</span> <span m='387000'>normally,
  this reaction with silver nitrate is used to</span> <span m='392000'>quantitatively
  precipitate chloride from solution.</span> </p><p><span m='397000'>So it is a quantitative
  analytical test for chloride in</span> <span m='402000'>solution. And the less ammonia
  we add,</span> <span m='405000'>the less silver chloride we are getting as a precipitate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='411000'>How are these facts related? Well, Alfred Werner put it
  all</span> <span m='416000'>together, and he correctly formulated these complexes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='427000'>Let me write this as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='448000'>In
  that first instance, when we have added six</span> <span m='452000'>ammonias, Werner
  decided that the reason that ammonia is not</span> <span m='457000'>in solution
  in a form that is reactive with hydrogen chloride</span> <span m='463000'>is because
  the ammonia is coordinated to the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='468000'>And so he
  wrote the formula this way.</span> </p><p><span m='471000'>Cobalt NH three six times.
  And this species</span> <span m='477000'>is a trication. And to balance those three</span>
  <span m='481000'>positive charges, we find that there must be</span> <span m='485000'>three
  chloride ions outside of what we are going to call the</span> <span m='489000'>inner
  coordination sphere of the cobalt complex.</span> </p><p><span m='493000'>Now, there
  were lots of different preparations that had</span> <span m='497000'>been reported
  in the literature back at this time of materials</span> <span m='502000'>that seem
  to be composed of metal ions and mixtures of</span> <span m='506000'>chloride or
  ammonia or other types of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='511000'>And this kind
  of a formulation of them was completely unique.</span> </p><p><span m='516000'>And
  I really think that in the history of chemistry,</span> <span m='520000'>you can
  compare Alfred Werner's leap, his development of the</span> <span m='525000'>coordination
  theory as very much analogous to Kekule's</span> <span m='529000'>description of
  planar benzene with all equivalent C-C bond</span> <span m='534000'>distances. This
  is really a tremendous</span> <span m='537000'>leap in our thinking about molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='542000'>And then, in the case where he is adding five equivalents
  of</span> <span m='547000'>ammonia, those five equivalents all go onto the cobalt,</span>
  <span m='552000'>and so does one chloride ion. So he writes it that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='557000'>And that chloride ion is balancing one of the three</span>
  <span m='562000'>positive charges on the cobalt plus three ion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='566000'>So this overall, now, has a two plus charge,</span> <span m='570000'>and
  there are two chlorides external to balance the charge</span> <span m='575000'>on
  that. And then in case three,</span> <span m='580000'>we have added four NH three
  per cobalt to solution.</span> </p><p><span m='586000'>Four of them go on the metal
  and two chlorides remain and</span> <span m='592000'>interact with the metal in
  a way that we will discuss shortly.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>And that system
  now has two of the plus three charges on cobalt</span> <span m='605000'>three balanced
  by chlorides that are in the inner coordination</span> <span m='611000'>sphere.
  And only a single chloride,</span> <span m='614000'>now, is needed externally to
  balance that charge to give</span> <span m='619000'>overall a neutral system. And
  then, finally,</span> <span m='623000'>when only three equivalents of ammonia are
  added to solution,</span> <span m='629000'>those three equivalents per cobalt bind
  to the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='635000'>And all three of the original chlorides
  can be included in the</span> <span m='639000'>primary coordination sphere, balancing
  the three positive</span> <span m='644000'>charges on the cobalt three ion and giving
  overall a neutral</span> <span m='648000'>coordination complex. This is coordination
  theory.</span> </p><p><span m='662000'>And the dominance of organic chemistry at
  that point in time</span> <span m='666000'>was very great. Most of the people who
  were</span> <span m='669000'>thinking about these unusual substances were thinking
  that</span> <span m='673000'>they might have structures analogous to those that
  organic</span> <span m='677000'>molecules have. And typical hydrocarbon</span> <span
  m='680000'>molecules like n-pentane or n-hexane have sequential joined</span> <span
  m='684000'>CH two groups, repeating CH two groups</span> <span m='688000'>in a line.
  And so the type of formula that</span> <span m='692000'>you were seeing people write
  for these molecules at that point in</span> <span m='696000'>time was, for example,
  a cobalt.</span> </p><p><span m='698000'>And then NH three, NH three, NH three,</span>
  <span m='700000'>NH three, somehow all stuck</span> <span m='703000'>together in
  a way that does not seem very intuitive to us today</span> <span m='707000'>because
  we know so much more now, partly due to the</span> <span m='710000'>accomplishments
  of Alfred Werner.</span> </p><p><span m='714000'>This systematic set of observations,</span>
  <span m='716000'>the use of silver chloride's insolubility as a means of</span>
  <span m='720000'>precipitating it out so that you could distinguish between</span>
  <span m='724000'>external chloride from chloride that is actually in the</span>
  <span m='728000'>coordination complex. And let me define coordination</span> <span
  m='732000'>complex.</span> </p><p><span m='745000'>The coordination complex is a
  metal ion.</span> </p><p><span m='758000'>Plus its ligands.</span> </p><p><span
  m='767000'>So there is another word that you need to learn in this</span> <span
  m='771000'>context. Here, I would like to define</span> <span m='775000'>the term
  ligand as an atom, or a molecule,</span> <span m='778000'>or an ion, that can bind
  directly to a metal like cobalt</span> <span m='783000'>in its primary coordination
  sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='786000'>And that means that they are directly connected
  to the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='793000'>And the amazing thing here and what
  was so different from</span> <span m='798000'>organic chemistry at this time was
  the idea that a single metal</span> <span m='803000'>ion can have a fairly large
  number of ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='807000'>In this particular case, Werner
  analyzed his experiments</span> <span m='812000'>with the assumption of coordination
  number being equal</span> <span m='817000'>to six.</span> </p><p><span m='828000'>So
  here, it is six. But coordination number is a</span> <span m='831000'>variable that
  depends on the metal itself and depends on the</span> <span m='835000'>specific
  choice of the ligands. Some molecules are known in</span> <span m='840000'>which
  there are very low coordination numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='844000'>A coordination
  number can be as small as two or one in some very</span> <span m='849000'>special
  instances for insoluble molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='853000'>And for very large
  metal ions, sometimes the coordination</span> <span m='858388'>number can be as
  great as about</span> <span m='861000'>So 12 atoms or ions or molecules directly
  connected to</span> <span m='866000'>a central metal atom. And ligands don't have
  to be as</span> <span m='871000'>simple as chloride or ammonia. Ligands can have
  some pretty</span> <span m='877000'>interesting architectures. And you can even
  dream up new</span> <span m='881000'>ligands with which to decorate a metal ion
  and with which to</span> <span m='887000'>imbue it with special properties for purposes
  like catalysis.</span> </p><p><span m='892000'>We will be talking soon about metaloenzymes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='896000'>These are proteins as ligands to metal complexes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='902000'>And very many important enzymes are metaloenzymes that have</span>
  <span m='907000'>these elements from the 3D part of the periodic table bonded.</span>
  </p><p><span m='913000'>Here is what we call the d-block, --</span> <span m='922000'>--
  or transition elements.</span> </p><p><span m='932000'>And, in the case of the 3D
  series, you will know that we</span> <span m='937000'>have metals like titanium,
  vanadium, chromium,</span> <span m='941000'>manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='944000'>These are called transition elements because oftentimes
  in</span> <span m='950000'>ions stemming from these elements, as you go from left
  to</span> <span m='955000'>right across the periodic table, you are adding more
  electrons</span> <span m='961000'>to an incompletely filled d-shell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='966000'>And at the end today, we are going to talk a little</span> <span m='969000'>bit
  about the bonding properties of transition elements.</span> </p><p><span m='973000'>And
  that will hearken back to what I said with my discussion</span> <span m='977000'>of
  carbon monoxide and why it is a poison.</span> </p><p><span m='980000'>And it is
  the interaction, actually, with certain</span> <span m='984000'>d-orbitals on the
  iron in hemoglobin that makes CO a toxic</span> <span m='988000'>substance. And
  so how does this work?</span> </p><p><span m='992000'>How do ligands coordinate
  two metals?</span> </p><p><span m='997000'>Well, one simple way is if you have a
  ligand like ammonia that</span> <span m='1003000'>is a base, it can also be a nucleophile,
  and the metal can</span> <span m='1010000'>be the corresponding electrophile.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1014000'>I can draw that to represent a lone pair of electrons on
  the</span> <span m='1020000'>nitrogen. Now that we have studied</span> <span m='1024000'>molecular
  orbital theory, you will know that I can also</span> <span m='1027000'>call this
  the highest occupied molecular orbital of the NH</span> <span m='1031000'>three
  molecule. And it is the one responsible</span> <span m='1034000'>for the basicity
  of the ammonia molecule and the one responsible</span> <span m='1038000'>for its
  ability to serve as a ligand in coordination</span> <span m='1041000'>complexes,
  like these. And you might also suspect that</span> <span m='1045000'>we might have
  some contributions to this highest occupied</span> <span m='1048000'>molecular orbital
  from hydrogen 1s linear combinations.</span> </p><p><span m='1053000'>I will just
  draw that in to make it a little bit more</span> <span m='1057000'>accurate. And
  so, you can think of this</span> <span m='1061000'>as a big fat lone pair that will
  coordinate to Lewis acids.</span> </p><p><span m='1066000'>And the metal ion is
  a Lewis acid.</span> </p><p><span m='1082000'>But it is a very interesting Lewis
  acid because,</span> <span m='1086000'>unlike the BH three molecule that has a single
  empty</span> <span m='1091000'>orbital, this metal seems to be able to act as a
  Lewis acid six</span> <span m='1096000'>times and coordinate six bases to it in
  forming this</span> <span m='1101000'>coordination complex. And if we go ahead and</span>
  <span m='1106000'>crystallize molecules of this sort and use X-ray diffraction</span>
  <span m='1112000'>studies to determine the bond angles and bond distances in</span>
  <span m='1118000'>systems like this, what we would find is that</span> <span m='1123000'>these
  nitrogens are located at the vertices of a nice,</span> <span m='1129000'>regular
  octahedron. So, in the case of our first</span> <span m='1134000'>one, we can draw
  it out this way.</span> </p><p><span m='1139000'>This first one is what would result
  if, to that aqueous</span> <span m='1143000'>solution of cobalt trichloride, we
  were to add six equivalents</span> <span m='1148000'>of ammonia. This is Werner's
  first system.</span> </p><p><span m='1151000'>It is a molecule oriented like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1154000'>That lone pair that comes from the highest occupied molecular</span>
  <span m='1159000'>orbital of ammonia is directed right at the metal from each of</span>
  <span m='1164000'>the six ammonia ligands. And this system does have a</span> <span
  m='1169000'>three plus charge that is balanced by three chloride ions</span> <span
  m='1174000'>in solution. This locating of six nitrogens</span> <span m='1178000'>in
  an array in space that approximates a regular</span> <span m='1182000'>octahedron
  is what makes the octahedron such a central aspect</span> <span m='1188000'>of the
  theory of transition element chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='1192000'>And, if
  you are going to design molecules that do include these</span> <span m='1198000'>transition
  metal ions, --</span> <span m='1202000'>-- whether you are going to do it for their
  color,</span> <span m='1205000'>like the red color there of the iron complex that
  we made a few</span> <span m='1209000'>moments ago, or whether you are going to
  do it to take advantage</span> <span m='1213000'>of the properties associated with
  unpaired electrons like</span> <span m='1217000'>magnetism, for example, you would
  begin any such</span> <span m='1220000'>approach with the octahedron as your starting
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='1238000'>Let's go ahead and consider some of the other
  examples</span> <span m='1241000'>provided to us by Alfred Werner.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1249000'>If instead of six, we are adding only five NH</span> <span m='1253000'>three
  molecules for every cobalt,</span> <span m='1256000'>then what happens --</span>
  <span m='1264000'>-- is indeed we do get an octahedron, but one of the</span> <span
  m='1267000'>chlorides is not ionized. It is bound directly to the</span> <span m='1271000'>metal,
  and it is serving as a ligand.</span> </p><p><span m='1274000'>And this species,
  therefore, has a two plus</span> <span m='1277000'>charge. The cobalt ion is still</span>
  <span m='1279000'>considered here to be in the plus three oxidation state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1283000'>And this system is balanced by two chloride ions that are</span>
  <span m='1288000'>floating around externally in solution and that are not in the</span>
  <span m='1292000'>primary coordination sphere. These atoms here that are part</span>
  <span m='1299000'>of ammonia molecules that are bonded directly to the metal are</span>
  <span m='1305000'>in the inner coordination sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='1309000'>That
  is, the inner or primary coordination sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='1328000'>What
  do you think happens if you take a metal salt and</span> <span m='1332000'>dissolve
  it in water? I did that a moment ago with</span> <span m='1336000'>ferrous chloride.
  I dissolved it in water.</span> </p><p><span m='1340000'>Water is a very polar solvent.
  It promotes the formation of</span> <span m='1345000'>ions in solution because of
  its great polarity.</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>It is good at solvating ions,
  water is, as a medium.</span> </p><p><span m='1355000'>If I take FeCl two and add
  it to water,</span> <span m='1359000'>as I did a moment ago, and it ionizes,</span>
  <span m='1363000'>what is happening to the iron?</span> </p><p><span m='1374000'>The
  iron is going to take up water molecules into its inner</span> <span m='1378000'>coordination
  sphere. When you dissolve FeCl two</span> <span m='1382000'>in solution, which might
  often be written</span> <span m='1386000'>quite simply as FeCl two aqueous,</span>
  <span m='1390000'>what you really have in solution is the system in which</span>
  <span m='1394000'>six water molecules are bonded to that iron.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1406000'>And, because I used FeCl two, this system had a two</span> <span m='1410000'>plus
  charged balanced by two of the chloride ions that</span> <span m='1413000'>dissociate
  from the iron and ionize and go out into solution</span> <span m='1418000'>to be
  solvated separately from the cation by water.</span> </p><p><span m='1422000'>That
  initial weakly-colored solution contained iron in this</span> <span m='1426000'>form,
  hexaaquairon two.</span> </p><p><span m='1429000'>And I will tell you a little bit
  about what made the color</span> <span m='1434000'>change in a moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1444000'>But first I would like to discuss an issue that arises in</span> <span
  m='1450000'>the Werner system. And this is the problem of</span> <span m='1455000'>isomerism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1464000'>Werner found that you could make different cobalt complexes</span>
  <span m='1467000'>that would have the same chemical formula,</span> <span m='1470000'>but,
  for example, one would be red and one would</span> <span m='1473000'>be green, or
  one would be yellow, for example,</span> <span m='1476000'>even though they have
  the same chemical formula.</span> </p><p><span m='1479000'>And that was because,
  as he correctly reasoned,</span> <span m='1482000'>they were forming isomers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1489000'>And this comes into play, for example,</span> <span m='1493000'>when
  you add only four equivalents of ammonia to</span> <span m='1498000'>solution. And
  here is why.</span> </p><p><span m='1501000'>If I put the first chloride up on top,
  as I have done here,</span> <span m='1506000'>there are two choices of where to
  put the second one that are</span> <span m='1511000'>not the same. I can either
  put a chloride</span> <span m='1515000'>here, such that we have a bond angle of
  90 degrees between the</span> <span m='1520000'>two chlorides. And I will draw in
  our</span> <span m='1523000'>remaining ammonia molecules that are coordinating to
  the cobalt.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>This is an isomer that we would call
  "cis." Cis denotes a</span> <span m='1535000'>proximal arrangement of the two chlorides
  with a 90 degree bond</span> <span m='1541000'>angle between them. And then the
  alternative here</span> <span m='1545000'>would be to put the other chloride 180
  degrees away from</span> <span m='1551000'>the first one. And that gives us what
  we call</span> <span m='1555000'>the trans iosomer.</span> </p><p><span m='1563000'>And
  note that both of these would have a single plus charge.</span> </p><p><span m='1568000'>Trans
  means across. So the two chloride ligands are</span> <span m='1573000'>located in
  a mutually trans disposition here.</span> </p><p><span m='1577000'>Isomerism is
  very important. I will discuss a couple other</span> <span m='1583000'>types of
  isomerism that you can get and that Werner contributed</span> <span m='1589000'>to
  our understanding of very greatly.</span> </p><p><span m='1599000'>And let me do
  that by completing consideration of</span> <span m='1603000'>this. You might ask
  yourself in the</span> <span m='1606000'>case where we added only three ammonias
  to the solution is</span> <span m='1611000'>there a possibility for the formation
  of isomers?</span> </p><p><span m='1615000'>And the answer again would be yes, we
  can have two</span> <span m='1619000'>possibilities. And this is for a neutral</span>
  <span m='1624000'>system that contains three ammonias and three chloride</span>
  <span m='1628000'>ligands. And let's say I put the first</span> <span m='1631000'>one
  here, the second one here, the third one here.</span> </p><p><span m='1636000'>That
  is one of our possible isomers of this neutral</span> <span m='1640000'>coordination
  complex. And then the other possibility,</span> <span m='1644000'>the only other
  possibility is with one there,</span> <span m='1648000'>one there, -- -- and then
  the third one here.</span> </p><p><span m='1653000'>And so you can try to draw different
  structures.</span> </p><p><span m='1656000'>And you will see that these are the
  only two possible structures</span> <span m='1660000'>that you can draw for a combination
  of three ammonia</span> <span m='1664000'>ligands and three chloride ligands surround
  a central</span> <span m='1667000'>cobalt three plus ion in an octahedral</span>
  <span m='1670000'>array.</span> </p><p><span m='1679000'>And these have names, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1681000'>This one is the so-called fac isomer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1685000'>And that fac is an abbreviation of the word facial,</span> <span m='1690000'>because
  if you remember that the octahedron is composed of a</span> <span m='1697000'>set
  of eight equilateral triangles, then the polyhedron</span> <span m='1702000'>that
  we call the octahedron has both vertices and faces.</span> </p><p><span m='1710000'>And
  these chlorides, in this particular case,</span> <span m='1713000'>can be seen to
  define one of the eight faces of the</span> <span m='1717000'>octahedron. And so
  that is the facial</span> <span m='1720000'>isomer. And then, the other type of</span>
  <span m='1723000'>isomer for this type of structure is called mer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1727000'>And that is an abbreviation of the word meridional,</span> <span m='1731000'>which
  would be like the meridians of longitude that you</span> <span m='1736000'>see on
  the globe. They start at the top and run</span> <span m='1741000'>down through the
  equator and all the way down to the South Pole.</span> </p><p><span m='1746000'>That
  is your meridional isomer. These isomers,</span> <span m='1750000'>here, are called
  geometric isomers.</span> </p><p><span m='1753000'>There are different types of
  isomerism.</span> </p><p><span m='1767000'>Because the complexes that differ only
  with regard to the</span> <span m='1773000'>spatial arrangement of the ligands,
  but not with respect to</span> <span m='1780000'>the formula of the system, these
  would be types of isomers</span> <span m='1787000'>known as geometric. We have the
  possibility of CIS,</span> <span m='1793000'>TRANS, FAC, MER geometric isomers for
  molecules that have</span> <span m='1800000'>the same formula. And then, there is
  a further</span> <span m='1806000'>type of isomerism. And here, again,</span> <span
  m='1810000'>the contributions of Alfred Werner were exceedingly important, because
  it was thought that this next type of</span> <span m='1811000'>isomerism was restricted
  to organic molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1812000'>And this is stereoisomerism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1830000'>Stereoisomerism is a little more subtle than geometric</span>
  <span m='1834000'>isomerism. And it is a little more subtle</span> <span m='1837000'>because
  two molecules that are stereoisomers of each other are</span> <span m='1842000'>related
  in the same way that your left hand and your right</span> <span m='1846000'>hand
  are related. They are non-superimposable</span> <span m='1850000'>mirror images.
  If you can find a way to</span> <span m='1853000'>separate molecules that are chiral,
  then you can have a</span> <span m='1857000'>sample that can do interesting things,
  like rotate the plane of</span> <span m='1862000'>polarized light. This happens
  when you have</span> <span m='1867000'>chiral molecules. And if a molecule is chiral,</span>
  <span m='1871000'>that is to say it is non-superimposable on its mirror</span> <span
  m='1876000'>image.</span> </p><p><span m='1894000'>And in order to see whether a
  molecule is or is not</span> <span m='1896000'>superimposable on its mirror image,
  you really need to get</span> <span m='1900000'>good at visualizing things in three-dimensions
  and at rotating</span> <span m='1903000'>molecules around in your mind. You can
  also do it on the</span> <span m='1906000'>computer. And doing it on the computer</span>
  <span m='1909000'>will help you prepare for doing it on the exam,</span> <span m='1911000'>where
  you have to do it in your mind.</span> </p><p><span m='1913000'>But if you like
  architecture, and you like visualizing things</span> <span m='1917000'>in three-dimensions,
  you should know that that is a</span> <span m='1920000'>lot of what we do in chemistry.
  You should think about these</span> <span m='1924000'>molecules, these 3D structures,
  in ways that allow you to test</span> <span m='1929000'>for a property like stereoisomerism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1931000'>And I mentioned that it was thought that stereoisomerism
  was</span> <span m='1936000'>a property associated with organic molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1939000'>And organic molecules were compounds of carbon that were</span>
  <span m='1943000'>thought to be associated very fundamentally with life and</span>
  <span m='1947000'>living things. And so the fact that Werner in</span> <span m='1951000'>one
  of his most amazing accomplishments was ultimately</span> <span m='1955000'>able
  to synthesize a coordination complex that</span> <span m='1959000'>contained no
  carbon at all but exhibited stereoisomerism just</span> <span m='1964000'>shattered
  that theory and really helped to bring science onto a</span> <span m='1969000'>much
  more firm footing. And that parallelism between</span> <span m='1973000'>organic
  and inorganic chemistry, I think, has stemmed from this</span> <span m='1978000'>aspect
  of its history. And so let's look at an example</span> <span m='1982000'>of a molecule
  that is chiral --</span> <span m='1990000'>-- that could be made from cobalt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1992000'>And if you imagine carrying out a reaction like we were
  talking</span> <span m='1996000'>about up above but not even giving it enough ammonia
  to</span> <span m='1999000'>displace all the water molecules then you could have
  an</span> <span m='2003000'>intermediate like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2020000'>And
  in this type of species what I've got are two water</span> <span m='2024000'>molecules,
  two ammonia molecules, two chlorides.</span> </p><p><span m='2027000'>And so if
  this is cobalt three, we would have a single positive</span> <span m='2032000'>charge
  on that ion. And what I can represent here</span> <span m='2036000'>by a dashed
  line would be a mirror plane.</span> </p><p><span m='2045000'>That is our mirror.
  And we are going to reflect</span> <span m='2048000'>this molecule through that
  mirror plane to see what its</span> <span m='2052000'>mirror image would look like.
  And then, if you can rotate it</span> <span m='2056000'>around in your mind, we
  can determine whether it is</span> <span m='2059000'>or is not superimposable on
  that mirror image.</span> </p><p><span m='2062000'>I am generating the mirror image
  by reflecting this water</span> <span m='2066000'>to this position. This ammonia
  back here reflects</span> <span m='2071000'>over to here. The top ammonia reflects
  still</span> <span m='2075000'>into the top position. This water behind the board</span>
  <span m='2079000'>reflects behind the board. And over here,</span> <span m='2082000'>this
  chloride coming out in front of the board reflects over</span> <span m='2087000'>to
  here. And we have one more chloride,</span> <span m='2090000'>down on the bottom.
  That molecule is now our mirror</span> <span m='2094000'>image. And let's go ahead
  and rotate</span> <span m='2097000'>it, like this. Because it is a little hard,</span>
  <span m='2102000'>I am going to highlight the position of the two ammonia</span>
  <span m='2106000'>ligands. And to see if this mirror image</span> <span m='2109000'>is
  superimposable on the structure we started with,</span> <span m='2113000'>I am going
  to rotate this around so that we can put the</span> <span m='2117000'>two ammonia
  ligands coincident with the two shown here</span> <span m='2121000'>underlined in
  green on the left. We are going to do a rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='2126000'>And
  I need to rotate this. I am going to rotate here,</span> <span m='2131000'>around
  the cobalt-chlorine bond access.</span> </p><p><span m='2134000'>And I am actually
  going to go in the negative direction to</span> <span m='2139000'>generate the following
  structure.</span> </p><p><span m='2142000'>This puts this ammonia up top, and it
  will put this one down</span> <span m='2148000'>below. We have NH three and NH three</span>
  <span m='2151000'>here. Let me underline them.</span> </p><p><span m='2154000'>So
  those are in positions, coincident.</span> </p><p><span m='2159000'>And this rotation
  also will carry that chloride from the</span> <span m='2164000'>bottom up here,
  into what I may call an</span> <span m='2167000'>equatorial position. And it puts
  a water molecule</span> <span m='2172000'>down. And that rotation about this</span>
  <span m='2175000'>cobalt chlorine bond left the cobalt and chlorine on that bond</span>
  <span m='2181000'>axis unrotated. And then in the back,</span> <span m='2184000'>we
  have this OH two molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2189000'>And what you can see
  is, if you now bring this over,</span> <span m='2192000'>what we have, in fact,
  is a situation where</span> <span m='2195000'>we are not currently superimposable
  with that choice.</span> </p><p><span m='2199000'>I generated the mirror image.
  I have rotated it by 90 degrees</span> <span m='2203000'>around the cobalt-chlorine
  bond axis to bring these two ammonias</span> <span m='2207000'>coincident with these
  two. So you can see that,</span> <span m='2211000'>whereas we have a water molecule
  on the bottom here,</span> <span m='2214000'>we have a chloride over here. So that
  is not superimposable.</span> </p><p><span m='2220000'>But we can do one more rotation
  to check the other possibility,</span> <span m='2226000'>and that rotation will
  be a rotation by 180 degrees around</span> <span m='2232000'>an axis, here, that
  bisects the</span> <span m='2235000'>nitrogen-cobalt-nitrogen bond angle of 90 degrees.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2240000'>We will rotate 180 degrees around that axis,</span> <span
  m='2245000'>and that will bring our ammonias, again,</span> <span m='2249000'>into
  a position so as to be coincident.</span> </p><p><span m='2258000'>And rotating
  around that axis brings a water around front here</span> <span m='2263000'>and puts
  a chloride in back, rotating around there,</span> <span m='2268000'>and it swaps
  this chloride with that water molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2273000'>So we now
  have chloride down and OH two over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>And so
  if we take this, we identify our ammonia</span> <span m='2283000'>positions by green
  underlining, they're coincident,</span> <span m='2287000'>here. And now where we
  have a</span> <span m='2289000'>chloride coming out, we have a water coming out,</span>
  <span m='2293000'>so our mirror image is not superimposable on the structure</span>
  <span m='2297000'>that we generated it from through the process of</span> <span
  m='2301000'>reflection through that mirror plane.</span> </p><p><span m='2304000'>And
  so, what we can say is that this molecule and this one</span> <span m='2308000'>constitute
  a pair of stereoisomers.</span> </p><p><span m='2313000'>And because this condition
  was satisfied that the mirror image</span> <span m='2316000'>was not superimposable
  on the structure we generated it from,</span> <span m='2320000'>the molecule is
  chiral. And you will see that I have</span> <span m='2324000'>chosen a molecule
  that contains no carbon, and yet it is chiral</span> <span m='2327000'>and it has
  stereoisomers. And that was thought impossible</span> <span m='2331000'>prior to
  the time of Werner.</span> </p><p><span m='2340000'>Let me show you another example
  of a molecule that is chiral.</span> </p><p><span m='2344000'>And I am going to
  use this example, also,</span> <span m='2347000'>to illustrate another important
  feature that ligands can have.</span> </p><p><span m='2358000'>And that is that
  they can have more than one atom that can bond</span> <span m='2363000'>to the metal
  at the same time.</span> </p><p><span m='2369000'>I am drawing a cobalt ion three
  plus complex that</span> <span m='2373000'>has six nitrogens directly bonded to
  the cobalt.</span> </p><p><span m='2377000'>But now, look what I am going to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2380000'>I am going to put some organic material in here and link
  these</span> <span m='2385000'>nitrogens by a CH two CH two unit,</span> <span m='2389000'>a
  CH2-CH2 chain here. So it is CH2-CH2.</span> </p><p><span m='2392000'>These carbons
  that I am representing as vertices here</span> <span m='2397000'>each have two additional
  hydrogens that I am not showing.</span> </p><p><span m='2403000'>And that is typical
  organic shorthand.</span> </p><p><span m='2406000'>And I am going to suggest that
  this molecule would be generated</span> <span m='2412000'>by adding three of these
  ligands to the metal center.</span> </p><p><span m='2416000'>And for each nitrogen,
  if you consider it as being</span> <span m='2421000'>derived from ammonia, one of
  the hydrogens of the</span> <span m='2425000'>ammonia is replaced with a nitrogen-carbon
  bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2431000'>And we have used this organic moiety here
  to tether two</span> <span m='2437000'>nitrogens together. This is a very popular
  and</span> <span m='2442000'>ancient ligand in coordination chemistry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2447000'>And, by drawing in simplistic form the two lone pairs on the</span>
  <span m='2454000'>two nitrogens, you can see that this set of</span> <span m='2459000'>four
  atoms is able to organize itself so as to simultaneously</span> <span m='2467000'>point
  two lone pairs at the same metal center.</span> </p><p><span m='2474000'>That is
  permitted by this bridge.</span> </p><p><span m='2477000'>This particular ligand
  is called ethylenediamine.</span> </p><p><span m='2487000'>And it is called en for
  short, ethylenediamine.</span> </p><p><span m='2492000'>And it is an example of
  a bidentate ligand.</span> </p><p><span m='2504000'>And that means that it has two
  teeth with which to bite down on</span> <span m='2513000'>the metal center. It is
  a double Lewis base.</span> </p><p><span m='2520000'>And when it binds to the metal
  center, we call that the process</span> <span m='2525000'>of chelation. When a bidentate
  or a</span> <span m='2528000'>multidentate, which would be maybe a</span> <span
  m='2531000'>tridentate or a tetradentate ligand, binds to a metal through</span>
  <span m='2536000'>multiple points, we call that a ligand chelate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2540000'>And we call the process one of chelation that forms these ring</span>
  <span m='2545000'>structures with the metal as part of the ring produced</span>
  <span m='2550000'>through multipoint binding of the ligand to the metal center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2557000'>And you are going to see that it is possible to have all
  kinds</span> <span m='2561000'>of different architectures for ligands in proteins
  or in</span> <span m='2565000'>synthetic systems. And the reason that I carried</span>
  <span m='2568000'>out over here earlier is one in which I added three equivalents</span>
  <span m='2573000'>of a bidentate ligand to this solution of iron two plus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2577000'>And, when that occurred,</span> <span m='2581000'>this
  bidentate ligand displaced the water molecules from the</span> <span m='2587000'>inner
  coordination sphere of the metal.</span> </p><p><span m='2591000'>And the bidentate
  ligand that I used was this one.</span> </p><p><span m='2596000'>This is a very
  common chelating ligand, a planar aromatic</span> <span m='2602000'>ligand. And
  you can see that,</span> <span m='2605000'>like ethylenediamine, its architecture
  promotes the</span> <span m='2611000'>pointing of a pair of electrons toward the
  same point in space.</span> </p><p><span m='2619000'>So that this ligand can bind
  itself to a metal center through</span> <span m='2623000'>two nitrogen lone pairs
  simultaneously.</span> </p><p><span m='2626000'>And it is the interaction of the
  d-electrons on the iron</span> <span m='2631000'>center with the unsaturated pi
  system of this organic ligand</span> <span m='2635000'>that produces the red color
  in ways that we are going to</span> <span m='2640000'>explore in more detail in
  one of our next lectures.</span> </p><p><span m='2645000'>But, before we do that,
  we are going to need to</span> <span m='2648000'>understand something about d-orbitals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2650000'>And, as you have learned, when you are forming molecular</span>
  <span m='2654000'>orbitals in systems that consist of either s or p orbitals,</span>
  <span m='2658000'>you needed to know something about the nodal properties of</span>
  <span m='2662000'>those atomic orbitals in order to build proper molecular</span>
  <span m='2666000'>orbitals. And that will certainly be the</span> <span m='2670000'>case
  for these more interesting elements that have d orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='2675000'>Not
  just s and p valance orbitals, but also a set of</span> <span m='2680000'>d-orbitals.
  And I call those the 3d</span> <span m='2683000'>elements because their principle
  quantum number for those</span> <span m='2688000'>elements is three. And what we
  need to now know is</span> <span m='2692000'>what do these orbitals have, as far
  as nodal properties,</span> <span m='2697000'>depending on the other quantum numbers?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2702000'>And I will draw a set of coordinate axes,</span> <span
  m='2706000'>here, on which to map these orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='2723000'>It
  should be pretty straightforward for you to keep</span> <span m='2726000'>straight
  the nodal properties of the d orbitals of which there is</span> <span m='2730000'>a
  set of five. We had one s orbital for a</span> <span m='2734000'>given valance shell,
  and we had a set of three p</span> <span m='2739000'>orbitals, and there is a set
  of five d orbitals for the d-block</span> <span m='2745000'>elements. And they can
  have different</span> <span m='2749000'>values for the quantum number m. One is
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2753000'>One is plus one. One is plus two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2756000'>And m can be minus one, and m can equal minus two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2763000'>And this quantum number determines the angular nodal</span> <span m='2768000'>properties
  of the d orbital in question.</span> </p><p><span m='2773000'>Here, let's draw a
  fairly simple one.</span> </p><p><span m='2777000'>Let's say that we have x, y,
  and z.</span> </p><p><span m='2781000'>Then what we might have is a d orbital that
  looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2794000'>d orbitals often have four lobes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2797000'>In fact, you will see that we represent four of the d orbitals</span>
  <span m='2805000'>this way and not the fifth. And let me use this pink to</span>
  <span m='2811000'>represent the negative phase. And so this orbital here is</span>
  <span m='2818000'>(d)xz. And that means that it has</span> <span m='2822000'>nodes.
  You have two planes that are</span> <span m='2825000'>nodes for a (d)xz orbital.
  And one of these is the</span> <span m='2830000'>x,y-plane. And then the other one
  is the</span> <span m='2833000'>y,z-plane. Those are planes when you go</span> <span
  m='2837000'>from one side through one of those planes to the other side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2842000'>The wave function changes sign. And, just like each p orbital</span>
  <span m='2848000'>has a single nodal plane, each d orbital has two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2854000'>And this is (d)xz. And we can also have one that</span> <span m='2858000'>we
  call d x squared minus y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='2862000'>And that one lies
  right along the coordinate axes like this,</span> <span m='2867000'>with the four
  lobes being skewered by the x-axis and the</span> <span m='2872000'>y-axis. And
  we have negative phase</span> <span m='2875000'>located along y for the d x squared
  minus y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='2880000'>And you can see that the nodal</span>
  <span m='2884000'>surfaces here both contain z. The nodes contain the z-axis</span>
  <span m='2890000'>and bisect the x and y coordinate axes.</span> </p><p><span m='2893000'>There
  is one plane up here that contains the z-axis and one over</span> <span m='2899000'>there
  located at 90 degrees to the first one.</span> </p><p><span m='2903000'>Those are
  the nodal planes for d x squared minus y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='2909000'>In
  addition to that (d)xz</span> <span m='2914000'>orbital, I have a (d)yz orbital,
  which is located with its lobes</span> <span m='2920000'>lying between the y and
  z coordinate axes.</span> </p><p><span m='2924000'>And it will have phasing as indicated
  here in pink.</span> </p><p><span m='2929000'>That is (d)yz. And it looks exactly
  like</span> <span m='2933000'>(d)xz. And it is just rotated by 90</span> <span m='2936000'>degrees
  around the z-axis relative to (d)xz.</span> </p><p><span m='2942000'>And then, finally,
  we have one that looks just</span> <span m='2946000'>like d x squared minus y squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2951000'>And this one is (d)xy. And, like d x squared minus y</span>
  <span m='2955000'>squared, the (d)xy orbital lies in the x,y-plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2960000'>And its lobes point between the axes, as shown here with that</span>
  <span m='2966000'>phasing. And then, finally --</span> <span m='2970000'>And we
  will return to this point next week.</span> </p><p><span m='2973000'>Our m equals
  zero orbital is our d z squared **d(z^2)**.</span> </p><p><span m='2978000'>And
  d z squared lies along and is skewered by the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='2984000'>It
  looks like a p orbital, except the sign is the same on</span> <span m='2989000'>top
  and on bottom. And then it has this beautiful</span> <span m='2993000'>torus here
  that is in the x,y-plane like that,</span> <span m='2997000'>so that its nodal surfaces
  are actually conical rather than</span> <span m='3003070'>planes. That is our set
  of five d</span> <span m='3007000'>orbitals with which we are going to do a lot
  more to understand</span> <span m='3012000'>the chemistry and coordination complexes.</span>
