  \ information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in\
  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>All right. I am going\
  \ to start with</span> <span m='17000'>Friday's lecture notes because there was\
  \ a significant amount</span> <span m='23000'>on them that I had not finished up\
  \ yet.</span> <span m='26000'>We had finally gotten to the point where we were talking</span>\
  \ <span m='31000'>about what does a wave function mean, what is the physical</span>\
  \ <span m='36000'>significance of it and how does it actually represent the</span>\
  \ <span m='40000'>presence of an electron? And what we saw was that the</span> <span\
  \ m='47000'>physically significant representation of the wave</span> <span m='52000'>function,\
  \ if you have some wave function Psi labeled by three</span> <span m='60000'>quantum\
  \ numbers, n, l and m.</span> <span m='64000'>And, of course, it is a function of\
  \ r,</span> <span m='68000'>theta and phi. The physically significant</span> <span\
  \ m='72000'>quantity was this wave function squared.</span> <span m='76000'>That\
  \ wave function squared, that was interpreted as a</span> <span m='82000'>probability\
  \ density. The wave function squared has</span> <span m='88000'>units. It has units\
  \ of inverse volume.</span> <span m='92000'>It is a density. It is a probability\
  \ per unit</span> <span m='97000'>volume. Now, as an aside,</span> <span m='99000'>because\
  \ someone asked me, I should tell you that the more</span> <span m='104000'>comprehensive\
  \ definition of the probability density is Psi,</span> <span m='110000'>not squared,\
  \ but Psi times Psi star,</span> <span m='114000'>where Psi star is the complex\
  \ conjugate.</span> <span m='120000'>Because it turns out that some wave functions\
  \ are imaginary</span> <span m='125000'>functions. And so, if you took an</span>\
  \ <span m='128000'>imaginary function and squared it, then you would still get an</span>\
  \ <span m='134000'>imaginary function after it. And then it is hard to</span> <span\
  \ m='139000'>interpret an imaginary function as a probability density.</span> <span\
  \ m='145000'>And so the more comprehensive definition is Psi times Psi</span> <span\
  \ m='150000'>star, where Psi star is the complex conjugate of Psi.</span> <span\
  \ m='157000'>And, when you multiply Psi by Psi star, if Psi is a complex</span>\
  \ <span m='162000'>function, well, then you get a real function.</span> <span m='165000'>This\
  \ is the more comprehensive definition of the probability</span> <span m='170000'>density,\
  \ Psi times Psi star. We won't use that.</span> <span m='174000'>I just wanted to\
  \ let you know about it.</span> <span m='179000'>So, probability density. Not only\
  \ do we want to know</span> <span m='183000'>something about the probability density.</span>\
  \ <span m='186000'>We also want to know something about the probability of finding</span>\
  \ <span m='192000'>the electron some distance away from the nucleus.</span> <span\
  \ m='196000'>And, to do that, what we were talking about was</span> <span m='200000'>this\
  \ quantity, this radial distribution,</span> <span m='203000'>the radial probability\
  \ distribution.</span> <span m='206000'>And what that is, is the probability of\
  \ finding</span> <span m='210000'>an electron in a spherical shell of radius r and\
  \ distance or</span> <span m='215000'>thickness dr. For example,</span> <span m='218000'>if\
  \ this gray portion here represented the probability</span> <span m='223000'>density\
  \ of the 1s wave function in our dot density diagram.</span> <span m='227000'>Remember,\
  \ we squared the wave function, got the probability</span> <span m='232000'>density\
  \ and then represented it with a dot density diagram,</span> <span m='237000'>where\
  \ the density of the dots was proportional to the value of</span> <span m='242000'>the\
  \ wave function squared. And, in the case of the 1s wave</span> <span m='248000'>function,\
  \ we saw that the probability density was largest</span> <span m='255000'>right\
  \ at r equals 0, and that is exponentially</span> <span m='260000'>decayed in all\
  \ directions uniformly.</span> <span m='264000'>That is what that gray part represents.</span>\
  \ <span m='270000'>But now, this blue, here, is my spherical shell.</span> <span\
  \ m='275000'>It has a radius r, and it has a thickness,</span> <span m='280000'>here,\
  \ dr. And the radial probability</span> <span m='284000'>distribution is asking,\
  \ what is the probability of</span> <span m='289000'>finding the electron in this\
  \ spherical shell?</span> <span m='294000'>And that spherical shell has a thickness\
  \ dr.</span> <span m='301000'>Another way to ask that is the probability of finding\
  \ the</span> <span m='305000'>electron between r and r was dr. That is what we wanted\
  \ to know,</span> <span m='310000'>and that is what the radial probability distribution\
  \ tells</span> <span m='315000'>us. Now, how do you get a value out</span> <span\
  \ m='318000'>of that? How do you actually calculate</span> <span m='321000'>the\
  \ radial probability? Well, to do that,</span> <span m='324000'>what we have to\
  \ know is this volume, here,</span> <span m='327000'>of the spherical shell. The\
  \ volume of this spherical</span> <span m='333000'>shell is just the surface area\
  \ of that spherical shell,</span> <span m='338000'>4 pi r squared, and the volume\
  \ is times this</span> <span m='343000'>thickness, this thickness dr. It is a very\
  \ thin shell.</span> <span m='348000'>It is an infinitesimally thin shell of thickness\
  \ dr.</span> <span m='353000'>Well, if we know that volume, then what we can do\
  \ is take our</span> <span m='359000'>probability density, Psi squared,</span> <span\
  \ m='362000'>which has units of probability per unit volume.</span> <span m='368000'>And\
  \ we are multiplying it, here, by our unit volume.</span> <span m='372000'>The unit\
  \ volumes cancel, and we are left with a</span> <span m='377000'>probability. So,\
  \ that is our probability of</span> <span m='381000'>finding that electron in a\
  \ shell of radius r and a thickness dr.</span> <span m='387000'>Let's look at the\
  \ result of calculating the radial</span> <span m='392000'>probability distribution\
  \ for the 1s wave function.</span> <span m='398000'>What did I do? I took Psi squared\
  \ for the 1s</span> <span m='402000'>wave function at some value of r, then I multiplied\
  \ it by 4 pi</span> <span m='408000'>r squared dr, and I did that for many</span>\
  \ <span m='411000'>different values of r and plotted the result here.</span> <span\
  \ m='416000'>That is what that radial probability is as a function of</span> <span\
  \ m='421000'>r. Well, the first thing you see</span> <span m='426000'>is that the\
  \ most probable value of r, or the value of r where</span> <span m='433000'>the\
  \ electron has the highest probability of being is at this</span> <span m='439000'>value,\
  \ a nought. The most probable value of r is</span> <span m='446000'>this value,\
  \ a nought. a nought is what we call</span> <span m='453000'>the Bohr radius. And\
  \ today, in a moment or so,</span> <span m='458000'>I will tell you why it is called\
  \ the Bohr radius.</span> <span m='463000'>It has a numerical value of 0.529 angstroms.</span>\
  \ <span m='468000'>And so it is most likely that the electron is about a half an</span>\
  \ <span m='474000'>angstrom away from the nucleus, making, then,</span> <span m='479000'>the\
  \ diameter of the hydrogen atom, on the average,</span> <span m='485000'>a little\
  \ bit over one angstrom. That is how we think about the</span> <span m='492000'>size\
  \ of a hydrogen atom, is to take this most probable</span> <span m='496000'>value\
  \ of r and double it to get the diameter.</span> <span m='500000'>The most probable\
  \ value of r, or the most probable distance</span> <span m='504000'>of the electron\
  \ from the nucleus, is half an angstrom</span> <span m='508000'>away. The most probable\
  \ distance of</span> <span m='513000'>the electron from the nucleus is not r equals\
  \ 0 because the</span> <span m='519000'>radial probability here is zero at r equals\
  \ 0.</span> <span m='524000'>That seems a little strange because the other day we\
  \ plotted</span> <span m='531000'>the probability density for the 1s wave function.</span>\
  \ <span m='538000'>And, when we did that, here is Psi(1,</span> <span m='542000'>0,\
  \ 0) squared versus r, what we saw was that the</span> <span m='547000'>probability\
  \ density was some maximum value at r equals 0 and</span> <span m='554000'>that\
  \ it exponentially decayed with increasing r.</span> <span m='559000'>And that is\
  \ the case. Probability density for the s</span> <span m='565000'>wave functions\
  \ is a maximum at r equals 0.</span> <span m='571000'>But the radial probability\
  \ here is actually zero at r equals 0.</span> <span m='577000'>Why? Look at how\
  \ we defined that</span> <span m='580000'>radial probability, here.</span> <span\
  \ m='582000'>It is Psi squared times this volume element.</span> <span m='587000'>Our\
  \ volume element is this spherical shell.</span> <span m='591000'>And, at r equals\
  \ 0, the spherical shell goes to a</span> <span m='596000'>volume of zero. So, our\
  \ radial probability here</span> <span m='602000'>is equal to zero at r equals 0.\
  \ That is really important,</span> <span m='607000'>that you understand that this\
  \ radial probability here is</span> <span m='612000'>always going to be zero at\
  \ r equals 0 for all of the wave</span> <span m='618000'>functions that we are going\
  \ to look at.</span> <span m='622000'>And we will talk about this a little bit more,</span>\
  \ <span m='626000'>the fact that the electron is about a half an angstrom away</span>\
  \ <span m='632000'>from the nucleus. But before I do that,</span> <span m='636000'>I\
  \ also just want to point out that in your textbook,</span> <span m='640000'>and\
  \ sometimes in the notes, that sometimes that radial</span> <span m='643000'>probability\
  \ is actually written as the following.</span> <span m='647000'>It is written as\
  \ the r squared, the distance variable,</span> <span m='650000'>times the radial\
  \ part of the wave function.</span> <span m='653000'>That is the radial part squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='656000'>We talked about the radial and the angular part last time.</span>\
  \ <span m='661000'>And the radial part is labeled only by two quantum numbers,</span>\
  \ <span m='666000'>n and l. And so, for the 1s,</span> <span m='669000'>that is\
  \ n equals 1, l equals 0.</span> <span m='672000'>Where does this come from? Well,\
  \ let me just emphasize or</span> <span m='678000'>explain where this comes from.\
  \ This radial probability</span> <span m='683000'>distribution here, we said for\
  \ the s wave</span> <span m='688000'>functions, was Psi squared. You could take\
  \ Psi squared,</span> <span m='694000'>the probability density, and multiply it\
  \ by this unit</span> <span m='699000'>volume or the volume of the shell, 4 pi r\
  \ squared dr.</span> <span m='704000'>Let's write that out again,</span> <span m='708000'>but\
  \ write it out now so that we write out Psi squared in terms</span> <span m='714000'>of\
  \ the radial part and the angular part.</span> <span m='719000'>Remember, we said\
  \ last time, for the hydrogen atom wave</span> <span m='725000'>functions, that\
  \ Psi is always a product of a factor only an r,</span> <span m='731000'>which was\
  \ the radial part, and a factor only in theta and</span> <span m='738000'>phi, which\
  \ are the angular parts.</span> <span m='741000'>Now, what you also have to remember\
  \ in looking at this is</span> <span m='748000'>that the angular part for the 1s\
  \ wave functions,</span> <span m='753000'>2s, 3s, all s wave functions, was equal\
  \ to 1 over 4 pi to the</span> <span m='760000'>1/2. If you square that,</span>\
  \ <span m='766000'>you are going to get 1 over 4 pi.</span> <span m='769000'>Therefore,\
  \ the 4pi's here are going to cancel for the 1s wave</span> <span m='775000'>functions.\
  \ And what you are going to have</span> <span m='778000'>left is this r squared\
  \ times just the radial part dr.</span> <span m='783000'>That is why the y-axis\
  \ in your</span> <span m='787000'>book is sometimes labeled this way for the radial\
  \ probability</span> <span m='793000'>distribution. But this is also important</span>\
  \ <span m='797000'>because if you were calculating the radial distribution function</span>\
  \ <span m='803000'>for something other than an s wave function.</span> <span m='809000'>The\
  \ way you would do it is to take just the radial part of</span> <span m='814000'>that\
  \ wave function times r squared, or just the radial part</span> <span m='820000'>of\
  \ that wave function and evaluate it at that value of r</span> <span m='825000'>times\
  \ r squared dr. You could not,</span> <span m='828000'>for the other wave functions,\
  \ take psi squared times 4 pi r</span> <span m='834000'>squared dr. And that is\
  \ because the angular</span> <span m='838000'>part for the other wave functions\
  \ that are not</span> <span m='842000'>spherically symmetric is not the square root\
  \ of 1 over 4 pi.</span> <span m='850000'>This is a broader definition for what\
  \ the radial probability</span> <span m='854000'>distribution function is. It just\
  \ works out,</span> <span m='858000'>in the case for the s wave functions, these\
  \ 4pi's cancel.</span> <span m='862000'>And so you can write the radial probability\
  \ for the s wave</span> <span m='866000'>functions like that. So, those are just\
  \ some</span> <span m='870000'>definitions. I want to talk some more about</span>\
  \ <span m='875000'>this radial probability distribution function,</span> <span m='880000'>here,\
  \ for the 1s wave function. I want to talk about it and</span> <span m='887000'>also\
  \ explain why a nought is called the Bohr radius.</span> <span m='894000'>The reason\
  \ for that is the following.</span> <span m='900000'>The nucleus was discovered\
  \ in 1911, the electron was known</span> <span m='904000'>before that, and Schr\u02C6\
  dinger did not write down his wave equation</span> <span m='909000'>until 1926.\
  \ And, in between that,</span> <span m='912000'>1911 to 1926, the scientific community\
  \ was</span> <span m='915000'>really working very hard to try to understand the\
  \ structure of</span> <span m='920000'>the atom. And we saw how the classical</span>\
  \ <span m='923000'>ideas, as predicted, would live a whopping 10^-10</span> <span\
  \ m='927000'>seconds. And one of the people who were</span> <span m='932000'>working\
  \ on that problem was Niels Bohr.</span> <span m='935000'>And, in 1919, Niels Bohr\
  \ of course realized</span> <span m='940000'>that classical physics fails this kind\
  \ of planetary model for</span> <span m='946000'>the atom where you put the nucleus\
  \ in the center and the</span> <span m='952000'>electron is going around that nucleus\
  \ with some fixed orbit.</span> <span m='958000'>We will call it r. Well, he knew\
  \ that it was not</span> <span m='963000'>going to work, that those classical ideas</span>\
  \ <span m='966000'>predicted that this would plummet into the nucleus in</span>\
  \ <span m='971000'>10^-10 seconds. But, he said,</span> <span m='973000'>obviously,\
  \ that does not happen, so let me just forget</span> <span m='978000'>classical\
  \ physics at the moment. Then, what he did was to impose</span> <span m='983000'>some\
  \ quantization on this classical model for the hydrogen</span> <span m='988000'>atom.\
  \ And the reason he got this idea</span> <span m='992000'>of quantization is because\
  \ he already knew the hydrogen atom</span> <span m='996000'>emission spectrum. He\
  \ knew that in the hydrogen</span> <span m='999000'>atom emission spectrum that\
  \ light of only certain</span> <span m='1003000'>frequencies was emitted. That is,\
  \ there was some idea</span> <span m='1007000'>that there was something about this\
  \ hydrogen atom that is</span> <span m='1011000'>quantized. He said, well,</span>\
  \ <span m='1012000'>let me just ignore classical physics for a moment.</span> <span\
  \ m='1016000'>Let me give this a circular orbit.</span> <span m='1020000'>But let\
  \ me quantize something about this hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='1025000'>And,\
  \ in particular, what he went and did was</span> <span m='1029000'>quantized the\
  \ angular momentum of that electron.</span> <span m='1034000'>He kind of just pasted\
  \ the quantization onto a classical</span> <span m='1039000'>model for the atom,\
  \ because he is trying to work</span> <span m='1044000'>toward explaining what the\
  \ observations were.</span> <span m='1050000'>When he pasted that quantization onto\
  \ this classic</span> <span m='1055000'>model, he was able to calculate a value\
  \ of r.</span> <span m='1060000'>And that value of r is what we call the Bohr radius,</span>\
  \ <span m='1066000'>a nought, and has the value 0.529 angstroms.</span> <span m='1071000'>That\
  \ came out of it. And if you calculate for the</span> <span m='1079000'>radial probability\
  \ distribution function for this model,</span> <span m='1086000'>which is called\
  \ the Bohr atom, would be one where that radial</span> <span m='1095000'>probability\
  \ is 1 right here at r equals a nought.</span> <span m='1103000'>In Bohr's model,\
  \ the electron had a</span> <span m='1108000'>well-defined, precise orbit.</span>\
  \ <span m='1114000'>The value of r at which it went around the nucleus was given\
  \ by</span> <span m='1119000'>a nought. He knew exactly where the</span> <span m='1123000'>electron\
  \ was in his model. This kind of model,</span> <span m='1127000'>which is this classical\
  \ model, really, is what we call</span> <span m='1131000'>deterministic. It is deterministic\
  \ because we</span> <span m='1135000'>know exactly where the particle, in this case\
  \ the electron,</span> <span m='1140000'>is. I want you to contrast it with</span>\
  \ <span m='1144000'>the quantum mechanical result from the Schr\u02C6dinger equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='1149000'>What you see, in the quantum mechanical</span> <span m='1153000'>result,\
  \ is that we don't really know where the electron is,</span> <span m='1158000'>so\
  \ to speak. The best we can tell you is a</span> <span m='1161000'>probability of\
  \ finding the electron at some value r to r</span> <span m='1166000'>plus dr. That\
  \ is the best we can do</span> <span m='1172000'>because quantum mechanics is non-deterministic.</span>\
  \ <span m='1176000'>There is a limit to which we can know the position of a</span>\
  \ <span m='1180000'>particle. That limit is given by</span> <span m='1183000'>something\
  \ called the uncertainty principle.</span> <span m='1187000'>The uncertainty principle\
  \ is not something we are going to</span> <span m='1192000'>discuss, but it tells\
  \ us that there is a limit to which we can</span> <span m='1197000'>know both the\
  \ position and the momentum of a particle.</span> <span m='1203000'>And that is\
  \ the basis for why, here, we have a probability</span> <span m='1209000'>distribution\
  \ and knowing sort of where the electron is.</span> <span m='1215000'>We don't exactly\
  \ know where the electron is, here.</span> <span m='1220000'>This is the classical\
  \ model on which Bohr just kind of pasted</span> <span m='1227000'>the quantization\
  \ of the angular momentum of the electron onto</span> <span m='1233000'>it. In the\
  \ case of the Schr\u02C6dinger</span> <span m='1237000'>equation, the quantization\
  \ drops out when you solve the</span> <span m='1241000'>differential equation. It\
  \ comes out of the equation</span> <span m='1244000'>just naturally. We did not\
  \ paste it onto it.</span> <span m='1247000'>We did not make an ad hoc kind of representation.</span>\
  \ <span m='1251000'>That is the big difference here between quantum mechanics and</span>\
  \ <span m='1255000'>classical mechanics. In quantum mechanics,</span> <span m='1260000'>it\
  \ can only tell you about a probability.</span> <span m='1264000'>It cannot tell\
  \ you exactly where the particle is going to</span> <span m='1269000'>be. Questions\
  \ on that?</span> <span m='1271000'>Okay. Anyway, this value a nought,</span> <span\
  \ m='1275000'>that is why it is called the Bohr radius.</span> <span m='1280000'>And\
  \ then it turns out, quantum mechanically,</span> <span m='1284000'>that this value\
  \ of r, the most probable value of r</span> <span m='1289000'>is, in fact, exactly\
  \ a nought.</span> <span m='1295000'>In a sense, Bohr was pretty lucky.</span> <span\
  \ m='1297000'>And this is kind of an accident that he got a nought out</span> <span\
  \ m='1302000'>of this, and it has to do with the actual form of the Coulomb</span>\
  \ <span m='1306000'>interaction. But, of course,</span> <span m='1309000'>this doesn't\
  \ work for anything else, other than a hydrogen</span> <span m='1313000'>atom. Whereas,\
  \ the Schr\u02C6dinger</span> <span m='1315000'>equation, as we are going to see\
  \ in a moment, is applicable to</span> <span m='1320000'>all the atoms that we know\
  \ about.</span> <span m='1324000'>So that is the radial probability distribution</span>\
  \ <span m='1328000'>function for the 1s atom, for the 1s state.</span> <span m='1331000'>We\
  \ want to take a look at the radial probability distribution</span> <span m='1337000'>for\
  \ 2s and for 3s. Let me plot those.</span> <span m='1340000'>And you can actually\
  \ put these lights on here.</span> <span m='1344000'>That is okay. I am going to\
  \ use this board</span> <span m='1348000'>for a moment. Here is the radial probability</span>\
  \ <span m='1353000'>distribution function. I can write it as little r</span> <span\
  \ m='1358000'>times R(2,0) squared of r,</span> <span m='1362000'>or RPD. This is\
  \ for 2s versus r.</span> <span m='1365000'>And when I do that I get a function\
  \ that looks like this.</span> <span m='1370000'>And, if I evaluate it here, what\
  \ is this value of r at</span> <span m='1375000'>which the probability is a maximum?</span>\
  \ <span m='1380000'>Well, this most probable value of r is 6 a nought.</span> <span\
  \ m='1384000'>Look at that.</span> <span m='1386000'>The most probable value of\
  \ r for 1s was a nought.</span> <span m='1390000'>In the case of the 2s state</span>\
  \ <span m='1393000'>here, the electron, the most probable value is 6 a</span> <span\
  \ m='1397000'>nought, six times as far from the nucleus.</span> <span m='1400000'>If\
  \ you have a hydrogen atom in the first excited state,</span> <span m='1404000'>in\
  \ a sense that hydrogen atom is bigger.</span> <span m='1409000'>It is bigger in\
  \ the sense that the probability of you finding</span> <span m='1414000'>the electron\
  \ at a larger distance away from the nucleus</span> <span m='1419000'>is larger.\
  \ And that, in general,</span> <span m='1422000'>is the case. The radial probability</span>\
  \ <span m='1425000'>distribution, here, also reflects the radial</span> <span m='1428000'>node\
  \ that we talked about last time.</span> <span m='1432000'>That radial node is r\
  \ equals a nought.</span> <span m='1435000'>Radial node is the value of r that makes\
  \ your wave function go</span> <span m='1440000'>to zero. Notice, again,</span>\
  \ <span m='1444000'>that this radial probability distribution function right here</span>\
  \ <span m='1450000'>is zero at r equals 0. This is not a node.</span> <span m='1454000'>This\
  \ is not a radial node. This is a consequence,</span> <span m='1459000'>right here,\
  \ of our definition for the radial probability.</span> <span m='1465000'>Our volume\
  \ element has gone to zero.</span> <span m='1470000'>r equals 0 is never a radial\
  \ node in any wave function.</span> <span m='1476000'>What about 3s? Well, let's\
  \ plot 3s.</span> <span m='1480000'>Here is 3s. This is the radial probability</span>\
  \ <span m='1484000'>distribution. I take Psi for 3s and square</span> <span m='1489000'>it,\
  \ multiply by 4 pi r squared dr,</span> <span m='1495000'>and do so for all the\
  \ values of r, and I am going to get</span> <span m='1502000'>something that looks\
  \ like this. Now this most probable value of</span> <span m='1510000'>r here, where\
  \ the 3s wave function is equal to 11.468 a</span> <span m='1516000'>nought. For\
  \ the second excited state of</span> <span m='1522000'>a hydrogen atom, that electron,</span>\
  \ <span m='1525000'>on the average, is 11.5 times farther out from</span> <span\
  \ m='1530000'>the nucleus than it is in the case of the 1s state right here.</span>\
  \ <span m='1538000'>Again, for that second excited state, that hydrogen atom is</span>\
  \ <span m='1543000'>bigger in the sense that the probability of it being farther</span>\
  \ <span m='1549000'>away from the nucleus is larger. That radial probability</span>\
  \ <span m='1554000'>distribution of the 3s also reflects the two radial nodes in</span>\
  \ <span m='1560000'>the 3s wave function. The radial nodes are at 1.9 a</span> <span\
  \ m='1567000'>nought, here, and 7.1 a nought.</span> <span m='1571000'>Again, the\
  \ value here at r equals 0 is not a radial node.</span> <span m='1579000'>Now, as\
  \ you look at this, it is tempting to ask the</span> <span m='1587000'>following\
  \ question. You might want to ask,</span> <span m='1593000'>if the electron can\
  \ be at these values of r, and it can be at</span> <span m='1600000'>these values\
  \ of r, and it can be at these values</span> <span m='1606000'>of r, how does the\
  \ electron actually get from here to here</span> <span m='1613000'>to here if right\
  \ at r equals 1.9 a nought and 7.1 a nought the</span> <span m='1620000'>probability\
  \ is equal to zero? Well, you might say maybe this</span> <span m='1628000'>probability\
  \ isn't exactly zero. It is something small.</span> <span m='1634000'>But I am telling\
  \ you that it is zero, goose egg,</span> <span m='1640000'>zilch, zippo, nada, cipher,</span>\
  \ <span m='1643000'>nix, nought. Anybody else have another name?</span> <span m='1648000'>Nil.\
  \ It is nothing.</span> <span m='1651000'>It is zero. How do you answer that</span>\
  \ <span m='1654000'>question? Well, it turns out,</span> <span m='1657000'>of course,\
  \ that it isn't an appropriate question.</span> <span m='1662000'>And the reason\
  \ it is not is because that question is asked</span> <span m='1668000'>in the framework\
  \ of classical mechanics.</span> <span m='1672000'>When you ask, how does a particle\
  \ get from</span> <span m='1676000'>one place to another, you are asking about a</span>\
  \ <span m='1681000'>trajectory. You are asking about a path.</span> <span m='1686000'>Particles\
  \ over here, over here, over here,</span> <span m='1690000'>how does it get from\
  \ one place to another?</span> <span m='1694000'>And, in quantum mechanics, we don't\
  \ have the concept of</span> <span m='1698000'>trajectories. Instead, what we have\
  \ to think</span> <span m='1702000'>of is the electron as a wave. And we already\
  \ know that a wave</span> <span m='1708000'>can have amplitude simultaneously at\
  \ many different</span> <span m='1712000'>positions. And so it has simultaneous</span>\
  \ <span m='1717000'>amplitude or probability here, here, and here,</span> <span\
  \ m='1722000'>all at the same time. We cannot talk about</span> <span m='1726000'>trajectories\
  \ anymore. And that, again,</span> <span m='1730000'>ties into the uncertainty principle,\
  \ our inability to know</span> <span m='1736000'>exactly the position and the momentum\
  \ of a particle at any</span> <span m='1742000'>given instance. The best we can\
  \ tell you is a</span> <span m='1747000'>probability. We have to change the way\
  \ we</span> <span m='1751000'>think about electrons. You cannot cast them in the</span>\
  \ <span m='1756000'>framework of your everyday world.</span> <span m='1759000'>This\
  \ is part of our world, but you have to go do a</span> <span m='1763000'>specific\
  \ type of experiment to see this part of the world.</span> <span m='1770000'>That\
  \ is why it seems so strange to you, because it is not part</span> <span m='1775000'>of\
  \ your everyday experience. But this world works with</span> <span m='1780000'>different\
  \ rules that you really do have to accept that it just</span> <span m='1785000'>works\
  \ differently. Questions?</span> <span m='1800000'>Now, I am going to stop talking\
  \ about the s wave functions and</span> <span m='1806000'>move on to talk about\
  \ the p wave functions.</span> <span m='1811000'>With the s wave functions, we talked\
  \ about the</span> <span m='1816000'>significance of the wave function, probability\
  \ density,</span> <span m='1822000'>radial probability distribution.</span> <span\
  \ m='1826000'>We talked about what a radial node was.</span> <span m='1832000'>Now\
  \ it is time to move onto the p wave functions.</span> <span m='1836000'>And the\
  \ p wave functions, of course, are not spherically</span> <span m='1841000'>symmetric.\
  \ And to represent them,</span> <span m='1844000'>we are going to do our dot density\
  \ diagram again.</span> <span m='1848000'>We are going to take the wave function\
  \ and square it to get</span> <span m='1854000'>the probability density and then\
  \ plot that probability density as</span> <span m='1860000'>a density of dots. We\
  \ the dots are most dense,</span> <span m='1865000'>well, that means the highest\
  \ probability density.</span> <span m='1870000'>Here is the result for the pz wave\
  \ function.</span> <span m='1874000'>It is pz because you can see the highest probability,</span>\
  \ <span m='1879000'>here, is along the z-axis. It is symmetric along the</span>\
  \ <span m='1883000'>z-axis. Here is the probability density</span> <span m='1887000'>for\
  \ the px wave function. You can see that the</span> <span m='1892000'>probability\
  \ density is greatest along the x-axis.</span> <span m='1896000'>It is symmetric\
  \ along the x-axis.</span> <span m='1899000'>And, if you look really carefully,\
  \ you can see that</span> <span m='1903000'>there is no probability density in the\
  \ y,z-plane for the px wave</span> <span m='1908000'>function. And, over here,</span>\
  \ <span m='1909000'>if you look carefully, you can see that there is no</span> <span\
  \ m='1913000'>probability density in the x,y-plane for the pz wave</span> <span\
  \ m='1918000'>function. And here is a py wave function,</span> <span m='1923000'>the\
  \ probability density of it. The probability density is</span> <span m='1928000'>concentrated\
  \ along the y-axis. It is symmetric along the</span> <span m='1933000'>y-axis. And,\
  \ if you look very</span> <span m='1936000'>carefully, there is no probability density,</span>\
  \ <span m='1940000'>here, in the x,z-plane. Well, the fact that there is no</span>\
  \ <span m='1945000'>probability density, here, in the x,y-plane,</span> <span m='1950000'>in\
  \ the case of pz, indicates that we have an</span> <span m='1954000'>angular node.\
  \ An angular node at theta equal</span> <span m='1959000'>90 degrees. An angular\
  \ node is the same</span> <span m='1962000'>thing as a radial node in the sense\
  \ that it is the value of</span> <span m='1966000'>the angle that makes the wave\
  \ function be equal to zero.</span> <span m='1971000'>Here is the wave function\
  \ for pz.</span> <span m='1973000'>You can see that when theta is equal to zero,</span>\
  \ <span m='1977000'>this wave function is going to be equal to zero.</span> <span\
  \ m='1982000'>An angular node is the value of theta or phi that makes the wave</span>\
  \ <span m='1988000'>function be zero. And the consequence,</span> <span m='1992000'>then,\
  \ is that we have a nodal plane, because everywhere on the</span> <span m='1999000'>x,y-plane,\
  \ theta is equal to 90 degrees.</span> <span m='2003000'>For the px wave function,\
  \ the value of the angle that</span> <span m='2009000'>gives you that nodal plane\
  \ is phi equals 90.</span> <span m='2015000'>That means everywhere in the y,z-plane\
  \ is phi equal to 90.</span> <span m='2021000'>In the case of py, when phi is equal\
  \ to zero,</span> <span m='2026000'>well, that is everywhere in the x,z-plane.</span>\
  \ <span m='2030000'>Everywhere in the x,z-plane, phi is equal to zero.</span> <span\
  \ m='2035000'>So, that is the angular nodes. In general, and this is</span> <span\
  \ m='2042000'>something you do have to know, an orbital has n minus 1</span> <span\
  \ m='2047000'>total nodes. And what I mean by total nodes</span> <span m='2052000'>is\
  \ angular plus radial nodes. The number of angular nodes is</span> <span m='2057000'>given\
  \ by this quantity, l.</span> <span m='2060000'>The quantum number l that labels\
  \ your wave function always</span> <span m='2065000'>gives you the number of angular\
  \ nodes.</span> <span m='2070000'>Therefore, if n minus 1 is the total and l is\
  \ the number of</span> <span m='2074000'>angular, well then, the number of radial\
  \ nodes is n</span> <span m='2078000'>minus 1 minus l. This is</span> <span m='2082000'>something\
  \ that you do have to know.</span> <span m='2084000'>If I give you a wave function\
  \ and ask you how many radial and</span> <span m='2089000'>angular nodes it has,\
  \ you need to be able to</span> <span m='2092000'>calculate that, and vice versa.</span>\
  \ <span m='2096000'>Sometimes I will tell you a function has three radial nodes</span>\
  \ <span m='2102000'>and six or seven angular nodes or something,</span> <span m='2107000'>what\
  \ is the wave function? So, we go both ways.</span> <span m='2112000'>Well, I also\
  \ want to take a look at the radial probability</span> <span m='2119000'>distribution\
  \ functions for the p wave functions.</span> <span m='2124000'>We looked at it for\
  \ the s wave functions already.</span> <span m='2131000'>I actually want to contrast\
  \ the radial probability distribution,</span> <span m='2136000'>say, for 2p, here\
  \ it is, with that of 2s</span> <span m='2140000'>that we looked at a moment ago.\
  \ Remember, how do you get the</span> <span m='2145000'>radial probability distribution\
  \ function here for 2p?</span> <span m='2150000'>It is the radial part of the 2p\
  \ wave function times r squared</span> <span m='2155000'>dr. It gives me the probability\
  \ of</span> <span m='2158000'>finding the electron a distance between r and r plus\
  \ dr.</span> <span m='2165000'>Again, what you see is that at r equals 0, that is\
  \ zero.</span> <span m='2170000'>That is not a radial node. But what I really want\
  \ to point</span> <span m='2175000'>out here is that the most probable value of\
  \ r,</span> <span m='2180000'>for the 2p wave function, is actually smaller than\
  \ it is</span> <span m='2185000'>for the 2s wave function. That is, it is more likely\
  \ for</span> <span m='2191000'>the electron in a 2p state to be a little closer\
  \ in to the</span> <span m='2197000'>nucleus than it is for the 2s state.</span>\
  \ <span m='2200000'>In general, as you increase the angular momentum quantum number,</span>\
  \ <span m='2206000'>the most probable value of r gets smaller for the same value</span>\
  \ <span m='2211000'>of n. Similarly, here is the 3s</span> <span m='2214000'>radial\
  \ probability distribution function that we looked at.</span> <span m='2221000'>Here\
  \ is a radial probability distribution for 3p.</span> <span m='2225000'>Now, with\
  \ the 3p, you can see the value of the</span> <span m='2228000'>radial node. You\
  \ can see the radial</span> <span m='2231000'>probability distribution reflects\
  \ a radial node,</span> <span m='2235000'>here. And here is the radial</span> <span\
  \ m='2237000'>probability distribution function for 3d.</span> <span m='2241000'>We\
  \ did not look at the probability density of 3d.</span> <span m='2245000'>You will\
  \ do that with Professor Cummins when you talk about</span> <span m='2250000'>transition\
  \ metals. But here, I just drew in the</span> <span m='2255000'>radial probability\
  \ distribution for 3d.</span> <span m='2259000'>But the point again that I want\
  \ to make is here is the most</span> <span m='2264000'>probable value of r for 3s,\
  \ here it is for 3p,</span> <span m='2268000'>here it is for 3d, again, the most\
  \ probable value</span> <span m='2273000'>for 3d is smaller than it is for 3p, than\
  \ it is for 3s.</span> <span m='2279000'>Again, as you increase the angular momentum\
  \ quantum number,</span> <span m='2285000'>that most probable value gets smaller.</span>\
  \ <span m='2289000'>However, ironically, if you actually look at the</span> <span\
  \ m='2294000'>probability of the electron being very, very close to the</span> <span\
  \ m='2300000'>nucleus, that probability is only significant for the s wave</span>\
  \ <span m='2306000'>functions. Look at the 3s wave function.</span> <span m='2311000'>Here,\
  \ you see that you really do have some probability very</span> <span m='2316000'>close\
  \ to the nucleus. You don't see that in the 3p</span> <span m='2320000'>wave function.\
  \ You certainly don't see that in</span> <span m='2323000'>the 3d wave function.\
  \ Again, in the 2s wave function,</span> <span m='2328000'>you have some significant\
  \ probability of the electron</span> <span m='2332000'>being really close to the\
  \ nucleus in 2s,</span> <span m='2335000'>but you don't in 2p. That is important.</span>\
  \ <span m='2340000'>And it seems in contradiction to the fact that on the average,</span>\
  \ <span m='2345000'>the most probable value of r gets smaller as l gets larger.</span>\
  \ <span m='2350000'>These two facts that look contradictory are important.</span>\
  \ <span m='2354000'>They dictate the behavior of atoms.</span> <span m='2357000'>These\
  \ two facts seem like kind of loose threads at the moment</span> <span m='2362000'>in\
  \ the sense that you are probably wondering why I am</span> <span m='2367000'>telling\
  \ you what I am telling you.</span> <span m='2371000'>But we are going to use that\
  \ information in a few days,</span> <span m='2376000'>and you will see really the\
  \ significance of this plot.</span> <span m='2381000'>And this plot will be an important\
  \ one for you to refer</span> <span m='2387000'>back to. Yes?</span> <span m='2407000'>Probably.\
  \ I am not exactly sure of the</span> <span m='2409000'>picture you drew in high\
  \ school, but yes.</span> <span m='2412000'>If the electron in general is further\
  \ out from the nucleus,</span> <span m='2417000'>that is a higher energy state.\
  \ The electron is less strongly</span> <span m='2421000'>bound, as we are going\
  \ to see in the multi-electron atoms here.</span> <span m='2435000'>Oh, no. For\
  \ the hydrogen no.</span> <span m='2438000'>Let me explain that. For the hydrogen\
  \ atom,</span> <span m='2442000'>the energies are only dictated by the n quantum\
  \ number,</span> <span m='2448000'>so 3s, 3p, 3d all have the same energies.</span>\
  \ <span m='2453000'>Where the energies become degenerate is with a</span> <span\
  \ m='2458000'>multi-electron atom. And we are going to talk about</span> <span m='2465000'>that\
  \ and how that reflects here, these wave functions in the</span> <span m='2471000'>next\
  \ day. That is all I am going to say</span> <span m='2476000'>about the hydrogen\
  \ atom. Now it is time to move on,</span> <span m='2481000'>to helium. And, of course,</span>\
  \ <span m='2484000'>the Schr\u02C6dinger equation predicts the binding energies\
  \ of</span> <span m='2490000'>the electrons to the nucleus in a helium atom also\
  \ very well.</span> <span m='2499000'>But, of course, it is a much more complicated</span>\
  \ <span m='2502000'>Schr\u02C6dinger equation. And I am not even going to</span>\
  \ <span m='2506000'>write out the Hamiltonian in this case, but I want to show</span>\
  \ <span m='2510000'>you the wave function here. See the wave function?</span> <span\
  \ m='2514000'>The wave function is a function of six variables.</span> <span m='2519000'>It\
  \ is a function of two r's, two distances from the nucleus,</span> <span m='2524000'>one\
  \ for electron one, one for electron two,</span> <span m='2527000'>two theta's and\
  \ two phi's. We have six variables for the</span> <span m='2532000'>wave function.\
  \ And the consequence of this is</span> <span m='2536000'>that our solutions for\
  \ the binding energies for the</span> <span m='2540000'>electrons in helium or any\
  \ other atoms are not going to be nice</span> <span m='2546000'>analytical forms.\
  \ We are no longer going to have</span> <span m='2551000'>e sub n equal minus the\
  \ Rydberg constant over n squared.</span> <span m='2555000'>If you actually solve\
  \ for those</span> <span m='2559000'>energies, and you have to do it numerically,\
  \ you are just going</span> <span m='2563000'>to get a list of numbers, a table\
  \ of numbers,</span> <span m='2566000'>but not a nice analytical form. If you solve\
  \ for the wave</span> <span m='2570000'>function, you are not going to get a nice\
  \ analytical form,</span> <span m='2575000'>like we got for hydrogen. Instead, what\
  \ you will get is a</span> <span m='2579000'>value for the amplitude of Psi as a\
  \ function of r,</span> <span m='2582000'>theta and phi. But if you get actually\
  \ much</span> <span m='2588000'>above three electrons, it turns out that even</span>\
  \ <span m='2592000'>numerically, you cannot solve the Schr\u02C6dinger equation,</span>\
  \ <span m='2598000'>exactly. You have to use approximations.</span> <span m='2603000'>And\
  \ we are going to look at the most basic approximation that is</span> <span m='2610000'>used\
  \ that works, amazingly.</span> <span m='2614000'>It works well enough for us to\
  \ have a framework in which to</span> <span m='2619000'>understand the reactions\
  \ of these atoms.</span> <span m='2622000'>And what is that approximation? Well,\
  \ that approximation is</span> <span m='2627000'>called the one-electron wave approximation\
  \ or the</span> <span m='2632000'>one-electron orbital approximation.</span> <span\
  \ m='2635000'>What does that mean? Well, that means this.</span> <span m='2640000'>I\
  \ am going to take my wave function here for the helium</span> <span m='2645000'>atom,\
  \ which strictly is a wave function that is a function of</span> <span m='2650000'>six\
  \ variables, and I am going to separate it.</span> <span m='2655000'>I am going\
  \ to let electron one have its own wave function and</span> <span m='2660000'>electron\
  \ two have its own wave function.</span> <span m='2664000'>That is an approximation.\
  \ In addition,</span> <span m='2668000'>what I am going to do is let the wave function\
  \ for electron</span> <span m='2673000'>one have a hydrogen-like wave function.</span>\
  \ <span m='2679000'>I am going to say that it has the 1s wave function,</span> <span\
  \ m='2683000'>or the Psi(1, 0, 0) wave function of a</span> <span m='2686000'>hydrogen\
  \ atom. And I am going to let electron</span> <span m='2689000'>two have the Psi(1,\
  \ 0, 0) wave function of a</span> <span m='2693000'>hydrogen atom. Or, I am going\
  \ to write it as</span> <span m='2696000'>1s of 1, for electron one, times 1s of\
  \ 2,</span> <span m='2700000'>for electron two.</span> <span m='2704000'>Or, another\
  \ shorthand, I am going to write it as 1s.</span> <span m='2707000'>squared. And,\
  \ if I continued on,</span> <span m='2709000'>here, it is for lithium. Lithium,\
  \ the wave function</span> <span m='2713000'>strictly has nine coordinates, but\
  \ I am going to let every one</span> <span m='2717000'>of those electrons, in the\
  \ one electron wave</span> <span m='2719000'>approximation, have its own wave function.</span>\
  \ <span m='2722000'>And I am going to let electron one have a wave function that</span>\
  \ <span m='2726000'>looks like a hydrogen atom wavefunction.</span> <span m='2730000'>The\
  \ 1s wave function. The same thing with electron</span> <span m='2733000'>two. And\
  \ then I am going to let</span> <span m='2735000'>electron three have the 2s wave\
  \ function of the hydrogen atom.</span> <span m='2740000'>And in simplified notation,\
  \ that is just 1s squared 2s.</span> <span m='2744000'>And here is beryllium, 16\
  \ variables,</span> <span m='2747000'>but I am going to let every electron have\
  \ its own wave</span> <span m='2751000'>function. And I am going to give electron</span>\
  \ <span m='2754000'>one the 1s wave function, electron two,</span> <span m='2756000'>the\
  \ 1s, electron three, the 2s, electron four,</span> <span m='2760000'>the 2s. I\
  \ can also write that,</span> <span m='2763000'>as you have already done, 1s 2 2s\
  \ 2.</span> <span m='2767000'>And I can keep going. And these electron</span> <span\
  \ m='2770000'>configurations that you have been writing down in high</span> <span\
  \ m='2774000'>school, that is what they are, electron configurations,</span> <span\
  \ m='2778000'>well, they are nothing more than our shorthand notation for</span>\
  \ <span m='2783000'>the electron wave functions within this one-electron wave</span>\
  \ <span m='2787000'>approximation. That is what those were,</span> <span m='2792000'>that\
  \ you were writing down. Those were a shorthand notation</span> <span m='2797000'>for\
  \ the wave functions in Schr\u02C6dinger's equation within</span> <span m='2802000'>this\
  \ one-electron wave approximation.</span> <span m='2806000'>Now, one thing you do\
  \ notice is that I did not,</span> <span m='2810000'>in the case of boron here,\
  \ let all five electrons be in</span> <span m='2815000'>the 1s state, or let all\
  \ five electrons be</span> <span m='2819000'>represented by a 1s hydrogen atom wave\
  \ function.</span> <span m='2825000'>I didn't because of a quantity that you already\
  \ know about,</span> <span m='2830000'>called spin. You already know that if you</span>\
  \ <span m='2834000'>are going to put electrons in the 1s state here that one</span>\
  \ <span m='2839000'>electron has to go in with spin up and the other spin down.</span>\
  \ <span m='2845000'>And the 2s, spin up and spin down, etc.</span> <span m='2850000'>What\
  \ is the phenomenon called spin?</span> <span m='2854000'>Well, spin is entirely\
  \ a quantum mechanical phenomenon.</span> <span m='2862000'>There is no correct\
  \ classical analogy to spin.</span> <span m='2868000'>Spin is intrinsic angular\
  \ momentum.</span> <span m='2873000'>It is angular momentum that is just part of\
  \ a particle,</span> <span m='2880000'>such as an electron. The spin quantum numbers</span>\
  \ <span m='2887000'>actually come from solving the relativistic Schr\u02C6dinger</span>\
  \ <span m='2891000'>equation, which we did not even write down.</span> <span m='2895000'>When\
  \ you solve the relativistic Schr\u02C6dinger equation,</span> <span m='2900000'>out\
  \ drops a fourth quantum number.</span> <span m='2903000'>That fourth quantum number\
  \ we are going to call m sub s.</span> <span m='2908000'>And we find that m sub\
  \ s</span> <span m='2911000'>has two allowed values. One of those values is one-half</span>\
  \ <span m='2916000'>and the other is minus one-half. Here, we have a case where\
  \ the</span> <span m='2921000'>quantum number is not an integer.</span> <span m='2924000'>It\
  \ is one-half and it is minus one-half.</span> <span m='2927000'>Now, if it helps\
  \ you to think about the electron spinning</span> <span m='2931000'>around its own\
  \ axis, like I depict here,</span> <span m='2934000'>well, if that is the case,\
  \ then the angular momentum</span> <span m='2938000'>quantum number is perpendicular,\
  \ here ,to this plane in which it</span> <span m='2943000'>is rotating. And you\
  \ might want to call that</span> <span m='2948000'>spin up. And, of course,</span>\
  \ <span m='2950000'>if it is spinning in the other direction, well,</span> <span\
  \ m='2954000'>then the angular momentum vector is pointed in the</span> <span m='2957000'>opposite\
  \ direction. You might want to call this</span> <span m='2961000'>spin down. If\
  \ it helps for you to think</span> <span m='2964000'>about this, okay, but remember\
  \ that this is not</span> <span m='2968000'>correct. This is a classical analogy</span>\
  \ <span m='2972000'>that we are trying to draw here. We are trying to say that this</span>\
  \ <span m='2977000'>electron is rotating around its own axis.</span> <span m='2980000'>That\
  \ is not true. This angular momentum is just</span> <span m='2984000'>an intrinsic\
  \ part, the intrinsic nature of a</span> <span m='2987000'>particular such as an\
  \ electron. Next time, I will tell you</span> <span m='2992099'>about Uhlenbeck\
  \ and Goudsmith. See you Wednesday.</span> </p>"
