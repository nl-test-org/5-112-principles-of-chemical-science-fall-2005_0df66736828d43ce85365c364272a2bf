  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>We are back here for
  some more stimulating discussion of</span> <span m='19000'>chemistry. And I want
  to begin today by</span> <span m='23000'>just saying that I find it particularly
  ironic that on the</span> <span m='27000'>day that I am all prepared to speak to
  you about the molecular</span> <span m='33000'>orbital energy levels of polyatomic
  molecules for which I</span> <span m='38000'>am using methane as an interesting
  example,</span> <span m='41000'>the boards are screwed up. The reason for that apparently</span>
  <span m='47000'>is that this screen came down and will not go back up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52000'>And one of the reasons that I have designed my presentation</span> <span
  m='57000'>technique for you this semester so heavily around the use of the</span>
  <span m='62000'>blackboard is that last year, when I taught the class,</span> <span
  m='66000'>I had a lot of feedback from students about how the one day</span> <span
  m='71000'>when we had audiovisual problems and I couldn't use my PowerPoint</span>
  <span m='77000'>and instead gave an impromptu chalk talk, that that was their</span>
  <span m='82000'>favorite lecture. Maybe next year we will</span> <span m='85000'>entirely
  be back to PowerPoint. I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='91000'>We will see.
  But, fortunately,</span> <span m='93000'>I did write out my notes this morning in
  electronic format,</span> <span m='98000'>so I can make use of them on the side
  boards.</span> </p><p><span m='102000'>And, in addition, I want to display for you
  some</span> <span m='107000'>molecular orbital shapes and properties.</span> </p><p><span
  m='110000'>And I will do that by starting out --</span> <span m='115000'>Actually,
  I would like to start, if I could,</span> <span m='116000'>with this one. I will
  go back to the document</span> <span m='118000'>camera in a moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130000'>Starting out right where we left off last time,</span> <span m='133000'>you
  will recall that we were looking at diatomic molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='138000'>We
  started out with a seven orbital problem two lectures</span> <span m='142000'>ago.
  We looked at the planar BH</span> <span m='144000'>three molecule. We had a molecule
  where the MOs</span> <span m='148000'>were mixing in two dimensions. And then last
  time,</span> <span m='153000'>when we looked at homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic</span>
  <span m='157000'>molecules the MOs were, in fact, mixing in just along</span> <span
  m='161000'>an axis in one dimension. And so, when we left the</span> <span m='165000'>situation
  last time, we had arrived at some kind of</span> <span m='168000'>an understanding
  of the energy levels in the carbon monoxide</span> <span m='173000'>molecule. And
  these were being developed,</span> <span m='176000'>especially, with reference to
  CO being a poisonous molecule,</span> <span m='180000'>-- -- whereas, N two,</span>
  <span m='183000'>another ten valence electron diatomic molecule was very,</span>
  <span m='187000'>very inert. Why was that?</span> </p><p><span m='189000'>It turns
  out that you have the very electronegative oxygen atom</span> <span m='193000'>on
  one side of the diagram with its very low energetically lying</span> <span m='197000'>orbitals
  mixing with the carbon orbitals that are higher in</span> <span m='201000'>energy.
  And the neat thing about this,</span> <span m='204000'>for the carbon monoxide molecule,
  is that it results in</span> <span m='208000'>an asymmetry of the molecular orbitals
  --</span> <span m='212000'>-- because the coefficients are not the same on the carbon
  side</span> <span m='215000'>as they are on the oxygen side as those atomic orbitals
  blend</span> <span m='219000'>together into the four sigma and four pi molecular
  orbitals that</span> <span m='223000'>we have. We have a total of eight MOs,</span>
  <span m='226000'>and they distribute energetically as four energy</span> <span m='229000'>levels
  in ascending energy that are sigma in symmetry.</span> </p><p><span m='232000'>That
  is, cylindrically symmetric about the internuclear</span> <span m='236000'>axis.
  And then we had four that were</span> <span m='238000'>pi. Two energies,</span>
  <span m='239000'>a pi bonding with four electrons and a pi antibonding</span> <span
  m='242000'>with just virtual empty orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='246000'>And
  because this highest occupied molecular orbital of</span> <span m='249000'>carbon
  monoxide is so heavily concentrated on the carbon end</span> <span m='254000'>of
  the molecule, you can essentially view this</span> <span m='257000'>as a carbon-based
  lone pair. It has this big lobe here,</span> <span m='261000'>through which the
  carbon can serve as a nucleophile or as a</span> <span m='265000'>base and bind
  to something that has an empty orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='270000'>And if that
  something that has an empty orbital also has a</span> <span m='274000'>filled orbital
  that matches the symmetry of the LUMO of carbon</span> <span m='279000'>monoxide,
  then you get the possibility for multiple bonding</span> <span m='284000'>between
  the carbon of the CO molecule and that other entity.</span> </p><p><span m='289000'>And
  we will see that that other entity may, in fact,</span> <span m='293000'>be a d-block
  transition element, such as iron.</span> </p><p><span m='298000'>And what I wanted
  to do was to go ahead and show you that the</span> <span m='303000'>LUMO is an interesting
  and unsymmetrical one,</span> <span m='306000'>as well. Let's take a look at that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='318000'>And so, in this picture I have gone ahead and included a
  little</span> <span m='321000'>ball and stick diagram underneath the representation
  of</span> <span m='324000'>the orbital lobes. Here is the carbon,</span> <span m='326000'>and
  the oxygen is colored red. And you can see that the lobes</span> <span m='331000'>on
  the LUMO, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in</span> <span m='335000'>this
  system, are also large on carbon relative to oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='339000'>The
  same as we had found for the highest occupied MO.</span> </p><p><span m='343000'>What
  this means is that that carbon atom in the CO molecule</span> <span m='347000'>is
  simultaneously a base in the sigma system.</span> </p><p><span m='350000'>And because
  this is our lowest unoccupied molecular orbital,</span> <span m='355000'>our carbon
  atom is actually an acid in the pi system.</span> </p><p><span m='360000'>And that
  makes it electronically very</span> <span m='362000'>complimentary to d-block elements,
  as we will see when we</span> <span m='366000'>get into the chemistry of elements
  that do have valence</span> <span m='370000'>d-orbitals in addition to s and p,
  coming up in a couple of</span> <span m='374000'>lectures. And so what can happen
  is that,</span> <span m='377000'>let's say that a carbon monoxide molecule somehow</span>
  <span m='381000'>erroneously finds its way into your blood stream,</span> <span
  m='384000'>you have there hemoglobin, the iron atom at the center of</span> <span
  m='389000'>which acts reversibly to bind the dioxygen molecule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='394000'>But it irreversibly binds to the carbon monoxide molecule</span> <span
  m='397000'>because the iron center, which is sitting at the center</span> <span
  m='401000'>of a heme unit that I mentioned, and we will talk about the</span> <span
  m='405000'>structure of hemoglobin and the way that it functions a little</span>
  <span m='409000'>bit later. But if CO gets in there,</span> <span m='411000'>it
  binds to the iron through the HOMO, acting as a base to</span> <span m='415000'>the
  metal acting as a sigma acid, and also through</span> <span m='418000'>d-electrons
  being able to act as a pi base from the metal binding</span> <span m='422000'>with
  this LUMO of the carbon monoxide molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='427000'>And this
  LUMO is doubly degenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='429000'>That means there are two
  of them at the same energy.</span> </p><p><span m='432000'>And we will come back
  to this issue of orbital degeneracy</span> <span m='436000'>later in today's lecture,
  but that electronic asymmetry</span> <span m='439000'>of carbon monoxide and the
  fact that the HOMO and LUMO are both</span> <span m='444000'>centered on the carbon
  end of the molecule are what make CO</span> <span m='447000'>such an interesting
  molecule and such a reactive molecule and</span> <span m='451000'>therefore a poison.
  And so now let us please go</span> <span m='456000'>back to the document camera.</span>
  </p><p><span m='466000'>What I have shown here are the five platonic solids.</span>
  </p><p><span m='469000'>Actually, I spent a lot of time over the weekend practicing</span>
  <span m='473000'>drawing these on the chalkboard so that I would be able to do</span>
  <span m='476000'>that very nicely for you. And here it comes that we do</span> <span
  m='480000'>not have that option today, so I will show them to you this</span> <span
  m='485000'>way. And the platonic solids are the</span> <span m='487000'>five regular
  polyhedra. And that means that they are</span> <span m='491000'>polyhedra that have,
  as their faces,</span> <span m='493000'>regular polygons that are all identical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='496000'>And the reason I am bringing this up today is that we had</span>
  <span m='500000'>talked about issues of symmetry with reference to molecular</span>
  <span m='504000'>orbital theory. And these are all very highly</span> <span m='507000'>symmetric
  shapes, as you can immediately</span> <span m='509000'>recognize. The buckyball
  that we looked at</span> <span m='514000'>earlier is not here because it has both
  five-membered rings and</span> <span m='518000'>six-membered rings on the faces.
  And so it doesn't have all the</span> <span m='522000'>faces identical. And those
  that do have all the</span> <span m='526000'>faces identical are the platonic solids.</span>
  </p><p><span m='529000'>And the complete list of those is shown here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='532000'>With triangles, you can put four equilateral</span> <span m='535000'>triangles
  together to make a tetrahedron.</span> </p><p><span m='539000'>There is actually
  a journal called Tetrahedron.</span> </p><p><span m='542000'>And there is another
  one called Tetrahedron Letters.</span> </p><p><span m='545000'>And there is another
  one called Tetrahedron Reports.</span> </p><p><span m='548000'>And the reason is
  that organic chemistry is carbon-based,</span> <span m='552000'>and carbon so often
  gets involved in forming tetrahedra.</span> </p><p><span m='556000'>And so the tetrahedron
  is a very important symbol of organic</span> <span m='559000'>chemistry. And we
  will get back to that.</span> </p><p><span m='562000'>And with triangles, if instead
  of putting four of</span> <span m='565000'>them together, you put eight of them
  together</span> <span m='568000'>this way, you get the octahedron.</span> </p><p><span
  m='572000'>And the octahedron is equally important as a symbol for</span> <span
  m='576000'>inorganic chemistry. And the reason for that is that</span> <span m='579000'>when
  we have metal ions in solution, they often sit at the</span> <span m='584000'>center
  of a coordination octahedron in which six ligands</span> <span m='588000'>bind to
  that metal center. And we are going to get into</span> <span m='592000'>how that
  was discovered pretty shortly by Alfred Werner,</span> <span m='596000'>another
  Nobel laureate in chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>And with triangles you
  can also make the icosahedron shown here,</span> <span m='605000'>and this has 20
  faces. And the icosahedron is</span> <span m='608000'>important in chemistry. And
  certain elements,</span> <span m='612000'>for example boron, actually have structures
  in the</span> <span m='616000'>solid state in which the boron atoms are arranged
  at the</span> <span m='620000'>vertices of a regular icosahedron.</span> </p><p><span
  m='623000'>So this is a chemically important shape as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='628000'>And if you go from triangles to squares you can,</span> <span m='631000'>of
  course, make a cube. And probably the most familiar</span> <span m='635000'>of a
  platonic solid to us. And then, if we go up to</span> <span m='639000'>pentagons
  and put those together, as you can see here,</span> <span m='643000'>we can put
  12 pentagons together in a regular way,</span> <span m='647000'>that gives rise
  to what we call the pentagonal dodecahedron.</span> </p><p><span m='652000'>And
  you can imagine that each of these vertices could be a C-H</span> <span m='657000'>unit,
  carbon-hydrogen. And then each carbon would have</span> <span m='662000'>its valence
  of four satisfied. And there would be all single</span> <span m='665000'>bonds at
  the parameter of this round molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='668000'>And, in fact,
  that dodecahedron molecule was</span> <span m='671000'>the objective of organic
  synthesis for quite a long time</span> <span m='675000'>before it was finally successfully
  synthesized by Leo</span> <span m='678000'>Paquette. You would be surprised with
  the</span> <span m='681000'>kinds of challenges, maybe, sometimes that do drive</span>
  <span m='684000'>chemists to do what they do. And that is the platonic</span> <span
  m='688000'>solids. I am going to be focusing our</span> <span m='692000'>attention
  on methane. And, if I could have the side</span> <span m='696000'>board go back
  to the computer for a moment,</span> <span m='699000'>that would be great. These
  are the notes for today's</span> <span m='703000'>lecture that I wrote up this morning
  that you will be able to</span> <span m='708000'>download later today, or maybe
  you already can.</span> </p><p><span m='711000'>I don't know. In any event,</span>
  <span m='713000'>when we approach the methane problem in molecular orbital</span>
  <span m='717000'>theory, what we do is recognize that the tetrahedron can be</span>
  <span m='722000'>conveniently inscribed into a cube by placing hydrogens at</span>
  <span m='726000'>alternating corners of the cube, as shown here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='732000'>And then, when we do that, the carbon atom of the methane</span> <span
  m='736000'>molecule lies at the very center of this cube.</span> </p><p><span m='739000'>And
  this way of arranging the system in space will help us to</span> <span m='744000'>simplify
  the problem of the molecular orbital energy levels</span> <span m='748000'>for the
  methane molecule. And we are going to be</span> <span m='752000'>ultimately working
  toward a comparison of the molecular</span> <span m='755000'>orbital description
  of the methane molecule with that</span> <span m='759000'>afforded by valance bond
  theory. Now, some of you approached me</span> <span m='763000'>after lecture last
  time and said, what happened to</span> <span m='766000'>hybridization? And, if you
  wanted to talk</span> <span m='769000'>about the methane molecule and the language
  of valence bond</span> <span m='772000'>theory, you would say that this carbon atom
  is sp three</span> <span m='777000'>hybridized in order that it may form simultaneously
  four two</span> <span m='780000'>electron bonds between the central carbon and the
  four</span> <span m='784000'>peripheral hydrogens. Well, where hybridization went</span>
  <span m='789000'>is that it stayed with valence bond theory.</span> </p><p><span
  m='792000'>Let me reemphasize the distinction between the</span> <span m='795000'>molecular
  orbital treatment of molecule electronic structure as</span> <span m='800000'>contrasted
  with the valence bond theory in which hybridization</span> <span m='804000'>plays
  a role. It does not play a role in the</span> <span m='807000'>language of MO theory,
  so please keep those quite</span> <span m='811000'>distinct. Now, we need to choose
  a</span> <span m='815000'>coordinate system for our problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='818000'>And I won't spend too much time discussing how we choose the</span> <span
  m='823000'>coordinate system, but what we have done in the</span> <span m='827000'>present
  case with methane is to choose the x,</span> <span m='831000'>y, and z axes each
  to come out of the faces of the cube.</span> </p><p><span m='837000'>And we do this
  because that choice of coordinate system will</span> <span m='842000'>lead to the
  equivalence of the carbons' 2px,</span> <span m='846000'>2py, and 2pz orbitals in
  3D space.</span> </p><p><span m='849000'>We could choose a different coordinate
  system,</span> <span m='853000'>and that would make the problem more difficult.</span>
  </p><p><span m='857000'>So, what we have done is chosen a convenient set of coordinates</span>
  <span m='862000'>where the x, y, and z axes each come out of the</span> <span m='867000'>faces
  of our cube. Now, we recognize that the</span> <span m='871000'>methane problem,
  like the homonuclear and</span> <span m='874000'>heteronuclear diatomic molecule
  problems we talked about last</span> <span m='878000'>time, is an eight orbital
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='880000'>The diatomics N two and CO each had ten
  electrons to go</span> <span m='884000'>into their eight molecular orbitals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='887000'>And here, with methane, we have eight electrons,</span>
  <span m='890000'>four coming in as the valence orbitals from the carbon atom,</span>
  <span m='894000'>valence electrons from the carbon atom, rather,</span> <span m='897000'>and
  four coming in as the four valence 1s electrons for the</span> <span m='901000'>four
  hydrogens. And our eight orbitals are the</span> <span m='906000'>carbons 2s, 2px,
  2py, and 2pz orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='908000'>And we have four more orbitals,
  the 1s from each of the four</span> <span m='912000'>hydrogens. We know how many
  electrons are</span> <span m='915000'>going to be able to go into our MO energy
  level diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='918000'>We know how many MOs we are going
  to have because we know</span> <span m='922000'>how many valance AOs we have. And
  those numbers are equal at</span> <span m='926000'>eight. The choice of this problem
  is</span> <span m='930000'>predicated on my desire to show you how things progress
  as we go</span> <span m='935000'>from a planar system to a linear system to now
  a system that has</span> <span m='940000'>molecular orbitals that stretch out in
  three-dimensional space.</span> </p><p><span m='945000'>Now, we are going to take
  the following approach.</span> </p><p><span m='949000'>We are going to say, how
  can we generate linear</span> <span m='952000'>combinations of the four hydrogen
  1s orbitals that will</span> <span m='956000'>be so constructed as to match the
  nodal properties of the</span> <span m='961000'>carbon atomic orbitals that are
  the valence orbitals of that</span> <span m='966000'>carbon? Okay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='968000'>So that is our goal, and that is our strategy.</span> </p><p><span m='972000'>And
  let me say also, that in this tetrahedral</span> <span m='977000'>symmetry, you
  can recognize that you cannot distinguish any one</span> <span m='983000'>of the
  four vertices of a tetrahedron from the other</span> <span m='988000'>three. And
  that is important.</span> </p><p><span m='991000'>And that is also true from the
  way that we have decided to</span> <span m='996000'>situate the hydrogen nuclei
  on this cube relative to our</span> <span m='1000000'>coordinate system. In other
  words,</span> <span m='1003000'>none of these four hydrogens lie on any of the three</span>
  <span m='1007000'>Cartesian axes. And their relationship to the</span> <span m='1011000'>coordinate
  system and to the shape of the cube each is</span> <span m='1015000'>indistinguishable
  from that of the other three hydrogens.</span> </p><p><span m='1021000'>And that
  is an important aspect of the way that we set up the</span> <span m='1024000'>problem.
  And why do I mention that?</span> </p><p><span m='1027000'>Because I mentioned that
  when constructing MOs in general,</span> <span m='1030000'>one of the first things
  you can do, if you are going to be able</span> <span m='1035000'>to take advantage
  of symmetry to help you solve the problem of</span> <span m='1039000'>these MO energy
  levels and how they are constructed from linear</span> <span m='1043000'>combinations
  of atomic orbitals is to identify symmetry-related</span> <span m='1047000'>sets
  of atoms in orbitals. If you are keeping that in</span> <span m='1052000'>mind,
  you will realize that we are treating all four hydrogens</span> <span m='1057000'>together
  because they are indistinguishable from one</span> <span m='1061000'>another in
  the tetrahedral shape of the methane molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1066000'>So,
  that is important. If we had a more complicated</span> <span m='1070000'>molecule,
  such as if we were looking at --</span> <span m='1075000'>I get to use a little
  bit of board space today.</span> </p><p><span m='1078000'>Here is a slightly more
  complicated hydrocarbon</span> <span m='1082000'>molecule. Here is a slightly more</span>
  <span m='1084000'>complicated hydrocarbon molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1087000'>And
  in a molecule like this, this is cyclohexane drawn in a</span> <span m='1091000'>chair
  confirmation. Sir Derek Barton actually was</span> <span m='1095000'>the Nobel laureate
  who got his prize for discussing</span> <span m='1099000'>conformational aspects
  of hydrocarbons.</span> </p><p><span m='1102000'>We would find that the hydrogens
  split up into two</span> <span m='1106000'>sets. They are not all equivalent in</span>
  <span m='1110000'>the cyclohexane molecule in this frozen out chair confirmation</span>
  <span m='1114000'>because we have one type that is equatorial and one type that
  is</span> <span m='1118000'>axial on each of these carbons as we go around this</span>
  <span m='1122000'>six-membered ring. And so there are different sets</span> <span
  m='1125000'>that you would have to treat separately.</span> </p><p><span m='1128000'>But
  methane is more symmetrical.</span> </p><p><span m='1130000'>And all four hydrogens
  in the methane molecule are identical,</span> <span m='1134000'>so we are going
  to treat them together in developing our</span> <span m='1138000'>linear combinations.
  And, coming back to this,</span> <span m='1142000'>what we are going to do, once
  again, to generate these</span> <span m='1146000'>things, is to imagine the central
  atom atomic orbital as</span> <span m='1150000'>growing out in space out to where
  the hydrogen nuclei are.</span> </p><p><span m='1153000'>And then we are going to
  take the sign of the wave function</span> <span m='1157000'>that we find out there
  and apply it to those hydrogens that are</span> <span m='1161000'>out there in space
  in order to see what our linear combination</span> <span m='1166000'>must look like.
  If you imagine the carbon 2s</span> <span m='1169000'>orbital, which has the same
  sign, positive,</span> <span m='1172000'>everywhere, and imagine it growing out
  to where the</span> <span m='1175000'>hydrogens are, and we are labeling the</span>
  <span m='1178000'>hydrogen A, B, C, and D, as shown here.</span> </p><p><span m='1180000'>And
  we will keep that same labeling scheme throughout the</span> <span m='1184000'>development
  of this problem. You would see that the carbon</span> <span m='1187000'>2s positive
  wave function, as we imagine it growing out to</span> <span m='1191000'>where the
  hydrogens are, would touch each of these</span> <span m='1194000'>hydrogens at the
  same time. And, thus, we confer the sign</span> <span m='1198000'>positive on all
  four of the contributors to this first of</span> <span m='1202000'>our linear combinations.
  And what that will represent is</span> <span m='1207000'>simultaneous bonding of
  the carbon 2s orbital with all four</span> <span m='1212000'>hydrogens and with
  the same sign everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='1215000'>And so, we can write down
  one-half A plus B plus C plus D,</span> <span m='1219000'>where I am using A here
  to</span> <span m='1223000'>represent the hydrogen 1s orbital associated with hydrogen</span>
  <span m='1228000'>labeled A. So I have just abbreviated that</span> <span m='1232000'>in
  A. And, similarly,</span> <span m='1233000'>B is the hydrogen 1s orbital associated
  with hydrogen B and</span> <span m='1237000'>so on. So, this is a linear</span>
  <span m='1239000'>combination of these four hydrogen orbitals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1242000'>And it is normalized with a half, here.</span> </p><p><span m='1244000'>And
  we have the same coefficient on each of the four</span> <span m='1248000'>hydrogens,
  so the size of the lobe that you would draw at each</span> <span m='1252000'>four
  of these positions would be the same.</span> </p><p><span m='1255000'>That is number
  one. We have built a linear</span> <span m='1259000'>combination based on the nodal
  properties of the carbon 2s</span> <span m='1263000'>atomic orbital. And now, let's
  do two more.</span> </p><p><span m='1266000'>And we are going to base these on the
  nodal properties of the</span> <span m='1271000'>central carbon 2px orbital and
  the central carbon 2py orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1275000'>I am using the same
  coordinate system as I started with,</span> <span m='1279000'>namely, that the positive
  x-axis comes out of the face of</span> <span m='1284000'>the cube and comes toward
  us, and the positive y-axis comes</span> <span m='1288000'>out of this face of the
  cube and goes that way.</span> </p><p><span m='1293000'>And we will look at z in
  a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1295000'>That one is going straight up out of the
  top face of the cube</span> <span m='1300000'>for positive z. What you can see is
  that if you</span> <span m='1304000'>imagine the carbon 2px atomic orbital as just
  growing out to</span> <span m='1308000'>where the four hydrogens are, we will see
  that the hydrogens</span> <span m='1313000'>in positions A and B will experience
  the positive lobe of</span> <span m='1317000'>the carbon 2px orbital at the same
  moment as the two hydrogens</span> <span m='1322000'>in back labeled C and D experience
  the negative lobe of</span> <span m='1326000'>the carbon 2px orbital. And so, we
  give positive phase</span> <span m='1332000'>to A and B and negative phase to C
  and D.</span> </p><p><span m='1336000'>And we give them the same coefficient everywhere
  such that</span> <span m='1340000'>this linear combination is normalized as one-half
  A plus B</span> <span m='1345000'>minus C minus D.</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>That
  is our second linear combination of hydrogen</span> <span m='1353000'>orbitals.
  And this one has been so</span> <span m='1356000'>generated as to match the nodal
  property of the carbon 2px</span> <span m='1360000'>orbital, the key feature of
  which is that it is everywhere</span> <span m='1364000'>positive along positive
  x, and everywhere along negative x</span> <span m='1368000'>it is negative. And
  the 2py orbital of carbon</span> <span m='1371000'>has the property that everywhere
  in the plus y region of space,</span> <span m='1376000'>it is positive, so that
  C and B will be</span> <span m='1379000'>associated with a positive sign for this
  linear combination.</span> </p><p><span m='1385000'>And the 2py orbital is negative
  everywhere along negative y,</span> <span m='1389000'>back here. And that is where
  hydrogens A</span> <span m='1392000'>and D are located. So, A and D will carry a</span>
  <span m='1395000'>negative sign for this new linear combination,</span> <span m='1398000'>which
  is one-half of minus A plus B plus C minus D.</span> </p><p><span m='1402000'>This
  is just one way of writing down</span> <span m='1406000'>the picture that we see
  here. And there is only one left to</span> <span m='1412000'>be generated from the
  nodal properties of the carbon 2pz</span> <span m='1417000'>orbital, which has its
  positive node oriented along positive z</span> <span m='1422000'>and its negative
  lobe oriented along negative z,</span> <span m='1426000'>and it has the x,y-plane
  as a nodal surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1430000'>And so, therefore, hydrogens
  A and C will carry a</span> <span m='1434000'>positive sign because they are oriented
  and located in the plus</span> <span m='1440000'>z region of space. Whereas, hydrogens
  B and D are</span> <span m='1445000'>located in the negative z region of space,
  so they will carry a</span> <span m='1449000'>negative sign. And that one can be
  normalized</span> <span m='1453000'>also with a normalization coefficient of one-half.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1456000'>And so it is A minus B plus C minus D.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1459000'>And just don't forget that these letters</span> <span m='1463000'>refer
  to the 1s orbitals associated with the hydrogens</span> <span m='1467000'>that are
  so labeled. And we started with identifying</span> <span m='1472000'>the fact that
  the four hydrogens in this problem are all</span> <span m='1477000'>equivalent.
  And, thus, their 1s orbitals</span> <span m='1480000'>are all equivalent, indistinguishable
  from each</span> <span m='1484000'>other with respect to their spatial orientation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1487000'>And, so we took four atomic orbitals, and we are</span>
  <span m='1491000'>constructing from them four linear combinations of those</span>
  <span m='1496000'>four atomic orbitals. I want to emphasize what I have</span> <span
  m='1501000'>written here, which is that with the</span> <span m='1504000'>coordinate
  system we have chosen and in this high tetrahedral</span> <span m='1508000'>symmetry,
  the carbons 2p x, y and z orbitals are identical.</span> </p><p><span m='1513000'>And,
  just like in a carbon atom floating free in space,</span> <span m='1517000'>they
  are degenerate. That means they have the same</span> <span m='1521000'>energy. And
  so we will talk about</span> <span m='1524000'>orbitals in atoms being degenerate
  in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1529000'>But we find that the 2p x, y and z
  orbitals on that carbon</span> <span m='1533000'>are going to have the same energy,
  and they are degenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='1537000'>And the molecular orbitals
  constructed from them in this</span> <span m='1541000'>tetrahedral system will have
  the same property.</span> </p><p><span m='1544000'>They will be degenerate. So,
  something that is</span> <span m='1547000'>occasionally associated with high symmetry
  is multiple MO</span> <span m='1551000'>degeneracy. Next, knowing what our carbon</span>
  <span m='1555000'>atom atomic orbitals are and knowing also what our four</span>
  <span m='1559000'>linear combinations are of the hydrogen 1s orbitals,</span> <span
  m='1563000'>we can now allow them to interact in ways that are either</span> <span
  m='1567000'>bonding or antibonding. And they interact,</span> <span m='1571000'>of
  course, according to their nodal properties.</span> </p><p><span m='1574000'>Those
  linear combinations that have the same nodal properties</span> <span m='1579000'>as
  a particular carbon atom atomic orbital will lead to a</span> <span m='1583000'>bonding
  interaction and an antibonding interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1589000'>And
  we have an eight orbital problem, so we better see eight</span> <span m='1593000'>energy
  levels appearing in our molecular orbital energy level</span> <span m='1597000'>diagram
  for this methane molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1599000'>And, when we go down
  here, starting at the lowest energy</span> <span m='1603000'>molecular orbital,
  we find that it can be</span> <span m='1606000'>constructed by adding to the carbon
  2s orbital,</span> <span m='1609000'>which is, once again, spherically symmetric,</span>
  <span m='1613000'>this linear combination that is A plus B plus C plus D.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1617000'>And we can draw this with a</span> <span m='1620000'>surface
  like this, which envelopes all five of our</span> <span m='1623000'>nuclei which
  has the same sign everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='1628000'>And so our lowest
  lying molecular orbital,</span> <span m='1630000'>our most bonding molecular orbital,
  our most stabilized MO,</span> <span m='1634000'>which can house a pair of electrons
  because it is singly</span> <span m='1637000'>degenerate, is one that will look
  something like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1641000'>It envelopes all five of our
  nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='1643000'>And, effectively, the pair of electrons
  is</span> <span m='1646000'>associated simultaneously with all five nuclei.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1650000'>And the wave function has the same sign everywhere,</span>
  <span m='1653000'>just like the carbon 2s orbital from which this is partially</span>
  <span m='1658000'>constructed does. And then, next we have three</span> <span m='1661000'>molecular
  orbitals that are each built by forming bonding</span> <span m='1665000'>interactions
  with the carbon's p-orbitals, px,</span> <span m='1668000'>py, and pz with the linear
  combination that matches that</span> <span m='1673000'>carbon orbital in terms of
  the nodal properties.</span> </p><p><span m='1676000'>And we built them that way
  so that becomes particularly</span> <span m='1680000'>straightforward. This one
  here is coming out,</span> <span m='1684000'>the face that points to the right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1687000'>And so you can see that this one is based on the carbon
  2py</span> <span m='1691000'>orbital. And, if that carbon 2py orbital</span> <span
  m='1693000'>makes a bonding interaction with the linear combination denoted</span>
  <span m='1698000'>as minus A plus B plus C minus D,</span> <span m='1701000'>the
  bonding interaction here is signified by this plus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='1705000'>So,
  we have a plus sign here and a plus sign here.</span> </p><p><span m='1710000'>And,
  thus, we have a molecular orbital that has the same nodal</span> <span m='1714000'>properties
  as a carbon 2py orbital does,</span> <span m='1717000'>which means that the x,z-plane
  is a nodal surface for this</span> <span m='1721000'>molecular orbital. And what
  it looks like is kind</span> <span m='1725000'>of a two-bladed propeller. You have
  a plus phase that is</span> <span m='1729000'>distributed, enveloping the two hydrogens
  that we labeled B and</span> <span m='1734000'>C, along with that positive lobe
  of the carbon 2py orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>So that you have that
  forming one blade of our two-bladed</span> <span m='1744000'>propeller. And the
  blade with the other</span> <span m='1748000'>sign is rotated relative to the first
  by 45 degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='1752000'>Sorry, by 90 degrees, in fact, and
  will involve the</span> <span m='1756000'>distribution of bonding character over
  carbon's negative</span> <span m='1761000'>2py lobe interacting with these two hydrogens
  back here,</span> <span m='1766000'>which are hydrogens A and D. And so we will
  visualize these</span> <span m='1772000'>in a moment to make that more clear.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1774000'>But these three bonds, one oriented along x,</span> <span
  m='1777000'>one oriented along y, and one oriented along z all</span> <span m='1781000'>look
  exactly like this. They are just rotated 90</span> <span m='1784000'>degrees to
  each other in space, just like the x,</span> <span m='1787000'>y, and z Cartesian
  axes are. I have only drawn one of them,</span> <span m='1791000'>but we have three
  of them because there is a three-fold</span> <span m='1795000'>orbital degeneracy
  in this molecular orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>So, singly degenerate
  and then triply degenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='1803000'>And then, as we go up
  in energy, we will find that our</span> <span m='1807000'>lowest unoccupied molecular
  orbital is constructed by</span> <span m='1810000'>subtracting. It is the same as
  I have</span> <span m='1813000'>written here, but with a minus sign,</span> <span
  m='1815000'>the C 2s subtracting A plus B plus C plus D.</span> </p><p><span m='1819000'>A,
  B, C and D hydrogens all</span> <span m='1821000'>have the same sign to their wave
  function as each other,</span> <span m='1825000'>but they have the opposite sign
  as the contribution from the</span> <span m='1829000'>carbon 2s orbital to this
  molecular orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1834000'>And what that results in, as
  I have tried to indicate</span> <span m='1837000'>with some red dashes here, is
  that you generate a nodal</span> <span m='1841000'>surface in between the carbon
  and hydrogen nuclei that will go</span> <span m='1846000'>completely around and
  will intersect perpendicular to each</span> <span m='1850000'>of these carbon-hydrogen
  inter-nuclear vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='1854000'>You have a change of sign
  as you are traversing the path from</span> <span m='1858000'>carbon to any one of
  the four hydrogen nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='1863000'>And that is what we get
  by just reversing the sign relative to</span> <span m='1866000'>the bonding counterpart
  of that orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1869000'>And that makes this one anti-bonding.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1871000'>We will give it an asterisk here to denote antibonding</span>
  <span m='1875000'>character to this molecular orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='1877000'>And
  now, ascending in energy, we will find that for each one</span> <span m='1881000'>of
  these orbitals that is bonded and oriented with respect to x,</span> <span m='1885000'>y
  or z in Cartesian space, we find that there is an</span> <span m='1888000'>antibonding
  counterpart. Again, what we are doing is</span> <span m='1892000'>taking, for example,
  carbons 2py and subtracting the</span> <span m='1896000'>linear combination that
  corresponds to carbon 2py in</span> <span m='1900000'>terms of its nodal symmetry
  properties.</span> </p><p><span m='1902000'>We are subtracting minus A plus B plus
  C minus D.</span> </p><p><span m='1907000'>The carbon 2py has the same</span> <span
  m='1909000'>plus, its positive lobe is oriented along positive y,</span> <span m='1913000'>just
  as it is down here, but now we have reversed the</span> <span m='1917000'>sign of
  the four hydrogens. And what this introduces will</span> <span m='1922000'>be antibonding
  nodal surfaces in between the carbon and the</span> <span m='1927000'>hydrogens.
  And they are strong antibonding</span> <span m='1931000'>interactions because of
  the good directional overlap of,</span> <span m='1936000'>say, the positive lobe
  of carbon's 2py with these</span> <span m='1940000'>s-orbital contributions in the
  negative from hydrogens C and B,</span> <span m='1946000'>here. And back here,</span>
  <span m='1948000'>A and D rotated, of course, by 90 degrees.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1953000'>One of the points that I was illustrating last time and</span> <span
  m='1957000'>really trying to emphasize in the context of MO theory is</span> <span
  m='1961000'>that, in general, we expect orbitals to be higher</span> <span m='1965000'>in
  energy if they have more internuclear nodes.</span> </p><p><span m='1968000'>And
  the energy of the orbitals is also affected by which atomic</span> <span m='1973000'>orbitals
  are close to the MO in energy and also by factors of</span> <span m='1978000'>overlap.
  And normally,</span> <span m='1981000'>for example, a sigma bond is typically</span>
  <span m='1984000'>associated with greater overlap than a pi bond because of the</span>
  <span m='1989000'>directionality of the overlap. And here, you have an</span> <span
  m='1993000'>interesting case, where this p-orbital is not</span> <span m='1997000'>directed
  right at the hydrogen. And it is not a pi bond either.</span> </p><p><span m='2003000'>It
  is something in between sort of sigma and a pi type of</span> <span m='2007000'>orientation.
  It is an oblique interaction of</span> <span m='2012000'>the hydrogen 1s wavefunction
  with that lobe of the p-orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='2016000'>But, still, it
  gives rise to very good overlap down here,</span> <span m='2020000'>and consequently
  a very strong antibonding character up here in</span> <span m='2024000'>counterpart.
  And, from calculation,</span> <span m='2027000'>this is the order of the energy
  levels that come out of that.</span> </p><p><span m='2031000'>And so we have only
  four energy levels, two of which are triply</span> <span m='2035000'>degenerate,
  so we indeed have eight wave functions that</span> <span m='2039000'>correspond
  to the molecular orbitals of this system.</span> </p><p><span m='2044000'>Question
  down here? Could you say that louder?</span> </p><p><span m='2065000'>Why did this
  not have the one-half?</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>The one-half is missing there
  because I forgot to put it</span> <span m='2069000'>there. Yes, to be normalized
  it should</span> <span m='2072000'>have a one-half there. That is right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2075000'>But then there is a further point that that brings up,</span>
  <span m='2079000'>which is the following. What I am implying here is that</span>
  <span m='2083000'>there are equal amounts of carbon 2s in the bonding orbital</span>
  <span m='2088000'>and as in the antibonding counterpart.</span> </p><p><span m='2091000'>But
  that need not be the case. It could be that this is 0.6</span> <span m='2095000'>here
  and that this 0.4 up here. And that is a greater level of</span> <span m='2101000'>detail
  than I am really interested in going into for the</span> <span m='2106000'>purposes
  of this problem. But your point,</span> <span m='2109000'>with respect to the coefficient,
  is well taken.</span> </p><p><span m='2113000'>Thanks. Christine, maybe we can fix</span>
  <span m='2116000'>that on the one that gets posted on the web.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2120000'>Let's now look at these things using our VMD program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2137000'>Starting from the lowest energy and we will work our way up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2148000'>Which orbital is this? This is a molecular orbital of</span>
  <span m='2152000'>the methane molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2160000'>One way
  you can identify orbitals is where they are with</span> <span m='2164000'>reference
  to the HOMO or the LUMO.</span> </p><p><span m='2166000'>In this case, the HOMO
  is triply degenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='2169000'>And there is one orbital lower
  in energy than the HOMO.</span> </p><p><span m='2173000'>This would be then the
  HOMO minus one because it is one</span> <span m='2177000'>below the HOMO in energy.
  That is the one which is the</span> <span m='2181000'>carbon 2s, plus A plus B plus
  C plus D.</span> </p><p><span m='2184000'>That is that MO there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2193000'>Actually, let's go ahead and take that one away.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2209000'>Sorry about that.</span> </p><p><span m='2215000'>Let's see if you can
  figure out which one this is.</span> </p><p><span m='2234000'>In order to figure
  out which one it is, you need to be able</span> <span m='2238000'>to realize where
  the nuclei are and where your internuclear</span> <span m='2243000'>nodes are, if
  any. And, if so, how many.</span> </p><p><span m='2246000'>This is one of our hydrogen
  contributions.</span> </p><p><span m='2250000'>Here is a hydrogen contribution with
  opposite sign.</span> </p><p><span m='2253000'>And there is a piece of our carbon
  2p orbital in the center.</span> </p><p><span m='2258000'>Now, this is just one
  of three identical counterparts that are</span> <span m='2263000'>rotated 90 degrees
  with respect to each other in space,</span> <span m='2267000'>so I am not going
  to show you all three of them.</span> </p><p><span m='2271000'>They all look exactly
  the same. Is this one bonding or</span> <span m='2275000'>antibonding? Yeah, this
  one is antibonding.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>And it does not have the same
  sign on all the hydrogens,</span> <span m='2283000'>so it has to be part of our
  LUMO, which is triply degenerate</span> <span m='2287000'>and involves bonding or,
  in this case,</span> <span m='2289000'>the antibonding between a carbon 2p orbital
  with a linear</span> <span m='2293000'>combination of four hydrogens. You can see
  that when you have</span> <span m='2297000'>an antibonding orbital, you are depleting
  the electron</span> <span m='2300000'>density in the space between the nuclei rather
  than increasing it</span> <span m='2305000'>as you do in a bonding orbital. Let's
  go ahead and look at the</span> <span m='2310000'>bonding counterpart of this one.
  And we will do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2314000'>And let's delete it. One thing
  that you will get,</span> <span m='2318000'>if you haven't already gotten it, is
  you are going to get a</span> <span m='2323000'>link to be able to download all
  the files that I used to show</span> <span m='2328000'>you molecular orbitals with
  in class.</span> </p><p><span m='2331000'>Because this program I am using, this
  VMD program,</span> <span m='2335000'>is available on Athena. And you can also download
  it</span> <span m='2341000'>yourself for free onto your own computer if you want
  to.</span> </p><p><span m='2346000'>And so this is going to give you the opportunity
  to study</span> <span m='2350000'>these orbitals and rotate them around at your
  leisure on your</span> <span m='2356000'>desktop. And now, let's look at the</span>
  <span m='2359000'>bonding counterpart to that antibonding orbital that we just</span>
  <span m='2364000'>looked at. This one is the two-bladed</span> <span m='2367000'>propeller
  to which I referred. And you can see that this</span> <span m='2373000'>orbital
  has the same symmetry with respect to its nodal</span> <span m='2377000'>properties
  as a carbon 2p orbital because it has a single</span> <span m='2381000'>nodal plane.
  And one side all the signs are</span> <span m='2385000'>positive, and on the other
  side all the signs are reversed.</span> </p><p><span m='2389000'>And we have a nice
  piece of bonding going on there and there</span> <span m='2394000'>when we have
  this oblique interaction of one of the lobes</span> <span m='2399000'>of a p-orbital
  simultaneously with two of the hydrogens that</span> <span m='2404000'>it sits directly
  between in space.</span> </p><p><span m='2408000'>There is one of our triply degenerate
  components of our</span> <span m='2413000'>highest occupied molecular orbital.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2417000'>And then, there is just one left to visualize.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2436000'>All right. We will delete that one.</span> </p><p><span m='2450000'>We
  looked at our most symmetric and most bonding molecular</span> <span m='2453000'>orbital.
  And now, we are going to go</span> <span m='2455000'>ahead and look at the antibonding
  counterpart of that</span> <span m='2459000'>one.</span> </p><p><span m='2473000'>And
  so this is clearly a molecular orbital that is formed</span> <span m='2477000'>using
  some piece of the carbon 2s orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='2480000'>And you see
  that you get a change in sign as you go from</span> <span m='2484000'>carbon to
  each of the hydrogens, that accordingly the electron</span> <span m='2488000'>density
  is depleted in the region of space between the</span> <span m='2492000'>nuclei.
  And that is a characteristic of</span> <span m='2496000'>an antibonding orbital.
  And this one,</span> <span m='2499000'>according to our diagram, in fact, is the
  LUMO.</span> </p><p><span m='2502000'>So, as you will see over here, that was what
  we predicted our</span> <span m='2507000'>lowest unoccupied molecular orbital would
  look like.</span> </p><p><span m='2511000'>And then, up here, we had our triply
  degenerate</span> <span m='2514000'>LUMO plus one based on the carbon 2p orbital
  interactions.</span> </p><p><span m='2520000'>Now, you can see what these four types
  of molecular orbital</span> <span m='2524000'>would look like. And now, you wonder,</span>
  <span m='2526000'>just what kind of prediction does this make regarding</span> <span
  m='2530000'>experimental observables. And so let's look at this</span> <span m='2533000'>picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2545000'>This diagram contains a number of interesting features.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2550000'>It is a diagram that plots ionization energy here on the</span>
  <span m='2554000'>x-axis against a number of different molecules on the</span> <span
  m='2559000'>y-axis. At the top you have simply a</span> <span m='2562000'>neon atom.
  Neon is our noble gas atom that</span> <span m='2566000'>lies just immediately to
  the right of fluorine in the</span> <span m='2570000'>periodic table. If anything
  is more</span> <span m='2573000'>electronegative than fluorine, it would actually
  be neon.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>This inert gas that is extremely difficult
  to ionize</span> <span m='2584000'>because it holds so tightly onto all eight of
  its electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2589000'>Does it hold equally tightly onto
  all eight of its electrons?</span> </p><p><span m='2594000'>The answer is no because,
  as you scroll across here in</span> <span m='2599000'>ionization energy, you see
  that its 2p electrons</span> <span m='2603000'>ionize here, and its 2s electrons
  ionize way over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2609000'>The type of diagram I showed
  you last time,</span> <span m='2611000'>where the 2s orbital, as you go across the
  periodic</span> <span m='2615000'>table, decreases in energy faster than does the
  set of 2p</span> <span m='2618000'>orbitals associated with an atom, is expressed
  in this</span> <span m='2622000'>diagram here because we have neon.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2624000'>And then we are going across the periodic table.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2627000'>This next molecule is HF, an eight electron species,</span> <span m='2631000'>and
  H two O, an eight electron species,</span> <span m='2634000'>and then NH three,
  ammonia, the other eight</span> <span m='2637000'>electron species. And then over
  here we get to CH</span> <span m='2642000'>four, the molecule that we have just</span>
  <span m='2645000'>discussed today. And what is very interesting</span> <span m='2648000'>here
  is that the ionization energies of the molecular</span> <span m='2652000'>orbitals,
  in the case of the molecules, and of the atom in</span> <span m='2656000'>the case
  of neon track very nicely.</span> </p><p><span m='2658000'>Here is the molecular
  orbital that has 2s character of HF,</span> <span m='2662000'>of H two O, of NH
  three,</span> <span m='2665000'>and of CH four. And it is rising in energy as</span>
  <span m='2669000'>we go from right to left across the periodic table.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2674000'>And that is because the carbon 2s orbital is much higher than</span>
  <span m='2678000'>the neon 2s orbital is, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='2681000'>And
  the carbon 2s orbital is contributing to that most</span> <span m='2686000'>bonding
  of molecular orbitals of the methane molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2690000'>And
  then there is this manifold here, that corresponds to</span> <span m='2695000'>ionizing
  an electron out of the HOMO of methane.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>And it is
  a broadened peak distribution here because of the</span> <span m='2704000'>different
  vibrational states that the methane can be found in</span> <span m='2708000'>when,
  in fact, it experiences an incoming high</span> <span m='2711000'>energy photon
  that is capable of knocking the electron out of the</span> <span m='2715000'>methane
  molecule and ionizing it.</span> </p><p><span m='2717000'>This is called photoelectron
  spectroscopy.</span> </p><p><span m='2720000'>And you will be reading about it also
  in the context of your</span> <span m='2724000'>problem set because we have a problem
  that deals with this.</span> </p><p><span m='2730000'>And I point you to a piece
  of your text that covers</span> <span m='2733000'>photoelectron spectroscopy. But
  the key point here is that</span> <span m='2737000'>if you had all your eight electrons
  at one energy,</span> <span m='2740000'>as valance bond theory might suggest for
  a molecule like</span> <span m='2744000'>this, you might think you should only see
  one peak in the PES of</span> <span m='2749000'>methane. But you see two because</span>
  <span m='2751000'>methane, the molecule has two molecular orbital energy levels,</span>
  <span m='2755000'>one of them being triply degenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='2757907'>See
  you on Wednesday.</span> </p>
