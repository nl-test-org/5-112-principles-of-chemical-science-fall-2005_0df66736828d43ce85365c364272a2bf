  </p><p><span m='15000'>Good afternoon. I hope you had a nice weekend.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23000'>Did you have a nice weekend? Good.</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>Today,
  we are going to start talking about the motion of</span> <span m='34000'>molecules.
  We are first going to talk</span> <span m='37000'>about the translational motion
  of molecules today and Friday.</span> </p><p><span m='42000'>And then we are going
  to talk about the internal motion,</span> <span m='46000'>in particular the vibrational
  motion of molecules and their</span> <span m='51000'>rotational motion. That will
  be early next week.</span> </p><p><span m='54000'>First, transitional motion. Certainly,
  the quintessential</span> <span m='60000'>equation that represents the behavior
  of gases is,</span> <span m='65000'>of course, the ideal gas law, P equals n over
  V times RT.</span> </p><p><span m='71000'>This equation accurately</span> <span
  m='74000'>represents the behavior of gases at low pressures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='79000'>It is an empirical law, of course.</span> </p><p><span m='82000'>It is
  a law that Boyle and Charles discovered by doing</span> <span m='87000'>experiments.
  They noted that as the</span> <span m='91000'>temperature is raised, the pressure
  went up.</span> </p><p><span m='95000'>They noted as the amount of gas or the number
  of moles of gas</span> <span m='101000'>added goes up, the pressure goes up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='104000'>They noted that as the volume of their gaseous container
  goes</span> <span m='109000'>up, the pressure goes down. Literally, this is an equation</span>
  <span m='115000'>established by experiment and just varying one variable at a</span>
  <span m='120000'>time. And since it looked like the</span> <span m='124000'>pressure
  was directly proportional to the temperature,</span> <span m='129000'>they wrote
  an equation where it was directly proportional to the</span> <span m='135000'>temperature,
  etc. And the proportionality</span> <span m='139000'>constant here was always this
  one constant R,</span> <span m='143000'>no matter what gas you had. But this ideal
  gas law</span> <span m='147000'>describes the macroscopic properties of a gas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='153000'>And what I mean by macroscopic properties are properties
  that</span> <span m='157000'>describe a collection of molecules.</span> </p><p><span
  m='160000'>For example, to really talk about a</span> <span m='162000'>pressure,
  you have to have a collection of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='166000'>We are
  going to talk about the pressure due to one molecule,</span> <span m='170000'>but
  that is really just a model.</span> </p><p><span m='173000'>If you want to talk
  about pressure, you need to have a</span> <span m='177000'>collection of molecules.
  If you talk about temperature,</span> <span m='182000'>it really only has meaning
  when you have a collection of</span> <span m='186000'>molecules. But what we want
  to understand</span> <span m='190000'>is what are the underlying microscopic phenomenon
  that</span> <span m='194000'>gives rise to this macroscopic equation or these macroscopic</span>
  <span m='199000'>properties. We want to know what is going</span> <span m='202000'>on
  in terms of the behavior of the individual particles,</span> <span m='207000'>the
  individual molecules that make up this gas.</span> </p><p><span m='212000'>Inquiring
  minds want to know what the temperature means when</span> <span m='217000'>we talk
  about individual molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='220000'>And that is also was
  Maxwell and Boltzmann wanted to know.</span> </p><p><span m='225000'>They wanted
  a microscopic explanation for PV equal nRT.</span> </p><p><span m='230000'>And,
  to do so,</span> <span m='233000'>they put forth a theory called the kinetic theory,</span>
  <span m='237000'>or the kinetic theory for the behavior of gases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='243000'>And that is exactly what we are going to take a look at here,</span>
  <span m='247000'>this kinetic theory. We are going to do what they</span> <span
  m='251000'>did. Basically, this kinetic theory</span> <span m='254000'>allowed properties
  of gases at low pressures to be predicted,</span> <span m='259000'>and it allowed
  an understanding of why some of the properties of</span> <span m='264000'>real gases
  at higher pressures deviated from this ideal gas</span> <span m='268000'>law. But,
  more importantly,</span> <span m='271000'>what it did was it allowed the quantity
  pressure times the</span> <span m='276000'>volume **PV** to be understood in terms
  of the motions of the</span> <span m='280000'>molecules. And it provided a means
  to</span> <span m='283000'>understand this concept of a temperature in terms of
  the</span> <span m='288000'>motions of the molecules. And that is what we are going</span>
  <span m='292000'>to look at today. We are going to see how we can</span> <span m='296000'>describe
  pressure and volume in terms of the motion of the</span> <span m='300000'>molecules
  and temperature in terms of the motion of the</span> <span m='304000'>molecules.
  That is our goal.</span> </p><p><span m='308000'>In order to do that, the first
  thing we have to do</span> <span m='313000'>is to understand what we mean by pressure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='317000'>For example, if you have some gas here in a</span> <span
  m='321000'>container and you are measuring the pressure of this gas in that</span>
  <span m='326000'>container, -- what you are really measuring</span> <span m='331000'>is
  the force that the gas exerts on one of the walls of this</span> <span m='337000'>container.
  That is, pressure is the force</span> <span m='341000'>exerted by the gas on one
  of these walls.</span> </p><p><span m='345000'>It is the force per unit area that
  is exerted on the walls of</span> <span m='351000'>that container. That</span> <span
  m='356000'>is what pressure is. But what Maxwell did,</span> <span m='360000'>--
  -- and this is 1850,</span> <span m='367000'>that he could understand this macroscopic
  pressure in terms of</span> <span m='374000'>the individual forces of the molecules
  when they hit the</span> <span m='380000'>container. In other words,</span> <span
  m='382000'>he proposed that this gas was composed of these molecules and</span>
  <span m='389000'>that these molecules were moving.</span> </p><p><span m='394000'>That
  was his proposal. And that when they moved and</span> <span m='398000'>hit the walls
  of the container, well, that was the force that</span> <span m='404000'>was exerted
  by the gas. In other words,</span> <span m='408000'>the force was really the individual
  forces,</span> <span m='412000'>F sub i, here, of the individual</span> <span m='416000'>molecules.
  That total force was the</span> <span m='420000'>individual force of the molecules
  hitting the walls of</span> <span m='425000'>the container. That is what led to
  this</span> <span m='428000'>macroscopic concept, the macroscopic quantity of</span>
  <span m='433000'>pressure. That was his idea.</span> </p><p><span m='435000'>Well,
  if that was his idea, he carried it through,</span> <span m='440000'>now, to a prediction.
  The idea is that this force</span> <span m='444000'>arises from the individual forces
  of these individual</span> <span m='449000'>molecules hitting the walls of the container.</span>
  </p><p><span m='455000'>Let's look at what theory he wrote down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='473000'>His goal, here, was to calculate these</span> <span m='476000'>individual
  forces, F sub i.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>And, of course, go back to classical
  mechanics.</span> </p><p><span m='483000'>Force is the mass times the acceleration,</span>
  <span m='487000'>the mass of the particle, the molecule,</span> <span m='490000'>times
  its acceleration. And acceleration we can write</span> <span m='494000'>just in
  terms of delta v over delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='497000'>That is just the mass
  times</span> <span m='501000'>delta v over the change in time. And if the mass is
  constant</span> <span m='506000'>here, this numerator, that is the change in momentum</span>
  <span m='509000'>per unit change in time. That is what this force is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='515000'>What we have to do, here, is calculate the change</span> <span m='519000'>in
  the momentum of the wall when the molecule hits the wall.</span> </p><p><span m='524000'>That
  will be the force of the individual molecule in the wall,</span> <span m='530000'>that
  over the time between the collisions of the molecule with</span> <span m='535000'>the
  wall. That is the individual forces.</span> </p><p><span m='540000'>That is what
  we are trying to calculate, right here.</span> </p><p><span m='544000'>Let's do
  that and calculate delta p, the change in the</span> <span m='549000'>wall's momentum.
  Let's do it in one dimension</span> <span m='554000'>first. Here is our box.</span>
  </p><p><span m='556000'>This is just a cross-sectional view of that box I drew over</span>
  <span m='561000'>here. And this is going to be the</span> <span m='564000'>wall
  that we are going to be interested in.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>The box has
  a length l. And we have this molecule with</span> <span m='574000'>some mass m.
  It is coming into the wall and</span> <span m='578000'>is going to collide with
  it, and it has some velocity vector</span> <span m='583000'>v. But let's do it in
  one</span> <span m='585000'>dimension because it is simpler to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='588000'>And then we are going to extend it to three dimensions in a few</span>
  <span m='594000'>minutes. We are just going to do it in</span> <span m='597000'>one
  dimension now. We are only going to be</span> <span m='601000'>interested in then
  the x-component of the velocity of</span> <span m='605000'>this molecule coming
  into the wall, and we want to know what</span> <span m='610000'>is the force exerted
  by this molecule when it collides with</span> <span m='614000'>this wall. First
  we have to get the change</span> <span m='618000'>in the momentum. This molecule
  comes in and hits</span> <span m='621000'>the wall, and we are going to consider
  it to be an elastic</span> <span m='626000'>collision. If the component of the</span>
  <span m='630000'>velocity in the x direction before the collision is v sub x,</span>
  <span m='636000'>then after the collision, it is minus v sub x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='640000'>We have just changed the direction of our velocity</span> <span m='645000'>vector,
  not the magnitude. The change in the atom's</span> <span m='650000'>momentum, then,
  is just the momentum after</span> <span m='654000'>minus the moment before. The
  momentum after was m times</span> <span m='659000'>minus v sub x. The momentum before,</span>
  <span m='663000'>m sub v sub x. Delta in the change in the</span> <span m='666000'>atom's
  momentum, is minus 2 m v sub x.</span> </p><p><span m='669000'>However, we have
  to conserve</span> <span m='674000'>momentum. The momentum change in the atom</span>
  <span m='677000'>plus the momentum change in the wall has to equal zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='682000'>And what we want to know is the momentum change in the wall,</span>
  <span m='687000'>because we are after this macroscopic quantity,</span> <span m='691000'>pressure.
  And so, if the change in the</span> <span m='695000'>momentum of the atom is minus
  2 m v sub x,</span> <span m='700000'>then the change in the momentum of the wall
  is 2 m v</span> <span m='706000'>sub x .</span> </p><p><span m='709000'>We have
  one quantity here. We have delta p.</span> </p><p><span m='712000'>But now, we have
  to calculate how often that momentum in the</span> <span m='717000'>wall changes
  due to this molecule's collisions.</span> </p><p><span m='723000'>We need the delta
  t. And so, what happens here?</span> </p><p><span m='727000'>The molecule comes
  in, collides, and then reflects.</span> </p><p><span m='731000'>And the molecule
  is now going in this direction,</span> <span m='735000'>where it hits the back wall,
  and then it reflects.</span> </p><p><span m='740000'>And ultimately it comes back
  and hits the front wall.</span> </p><p><span m='744000'>And what we want to know
  is what is the time here between</span> <span m='749000'>the collisions. The time
  between when that</span> <span m='754000'>molecule makes the momentum in the wall
  change.</span> </p><p><span m='758000'>What is this time, delta t?</span> </p><p><span
  m='760000'>Well, if we know the length of the box and we know the value of</span>
  <span m='766000'>v sub x, we can calculate that time.</span> </p><p><span m='769000'>That
  time is just two times the length of the box because that</span> <span m='774000'>molecule
  is traveling back and then forth, --</span> <span m='780000'>-- that is 2l divided
  by the velocity component in the x</span> <span m='784000'>direction, v sub x. That</span>
  <span m='789000'>is delta t. Now we have delta p and delta</span> <span m='793000'>t,
  and we can plug that in and make it simple a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='798000'>And
  so, here is the force exerted by the collision of one</span> <span m='803000'>molecule
  on that one wall of the container, m v sub x squared</span> <span m='808000'>over
  l.</span> </p><p><span m='813000'>But we said that Maxwell's idea was that the macroscopic
  total</span> <span m='818000'>force was the sum of these individual forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='823000'>What we have to do is take the force of each individual</span>
  <span m='828000'>molecule and add them up over all the molecules.</span> </p><p><span
  m='832000'>There is that force for molecule one,</span> <span m='836000'>molecule
  two, molecule three,</span> <span m='839000'>all the way up to molecule n. I am
  going to pull out an m</span> <span m='845000'>over l out of this. I just pull out
  an m over l,</span> <span m='850000'>and I have left the sum of the squares of the
  velocities in the</span> <span m='856000'>x direction for each one of the molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='860000'>Notice here, in this treatment,</span> <span m='863000'>we
  have identical m's. The particles are the same,</span> <span m='867000'>but, and
  this is important, the velocities of the molecules</span> <span m='873000'>are not
  the same. That is going to be important.</span> </p><p><span m='878000'>Now, this
  expression here, I want to simplify a little</span> <span m='884000'>bit. In particular,</span>
  <span m='885000'>I want to simplify the sum of the squares of the velocity</span>
  <span m='891000'>components in the x direction for each one of the molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='896000'>To do that simplification, I am going to introduce this</span>
  <span m='902000'>quantity. This quantity is the average of</span> <span m='906000'>the
  square of the velocity in the x direction.</span> </p><p><span m='910000'>What this
  means is I take the velocity in the x direction,</span> <span m='915000'>I square
  it, and then I take the average.</span> </p><p><span m='918000'>This is not the
  square of the average velocity in the x</span> <span m='923000'>direction. That
  is different.</span> </p><p><span m='926000'>This is the average of the square of
  the velocity in the x</span> <span m='931000'>direction. How am I going to evaluate
  that</span> <span m='935000'>quantity? Well, I am going to take the</span> <span
  m='938000'>velocity in the x direction for molecule one and square it and</span>
  <span m='943000'>add to that the square of the velocity in the x direction for</span>
  <span m='947000'>molecule two and add to that the square of the velocity in the
  x</span> <span m='952000'>direction for molecule three, all the way up to molecule
  n.</span> </p><p><span m='958000'>And then, if I want the average, I am going to
  divide by</span> <span m='963000'>n, the number of molecules there are.</span> </p><p><span
  m='966000'>I am just going to bring n, here, over to the other side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='971000'>I have n times the average of the velocity in the x direction</span>
  <span m='977000'>squared as this sum, and this is exactly the sum</span> <span m='981000'>that
  I had in my expression for the total force.</span> </p><p><span m='985000'>I can
  simplify that now. There is that same expression.</span> </p><p><span m='991000'>Here
  is my total force. What I am going to do is I am</span> <span m='996000'>going to
  substitute n times the average of the velocity in the x</span> <span m='1002000'>direction
  squared in for this whole sum, and I have now</span> <span m='1006000'>something
  that is much tidier. That is the total force exerted</span> <span m='1012000'>by
  all the collisions of the molecules in the container on</span> <span m='1017000'>that
  front wall. But now I want the pressure.</span> </p><p><span m='1023000'>And the
  pressure is just force per unit area.</span> </p><p><span m='1028000'>And so, I
  am going to take my expression for the force and</span> <span m='1035000'>divide
  it by the unit area. The area is the area of this</span> <span m='1041000'>wall,
  here, in my initial example.</span> </p><p><span m='1045000'>I am going to call
  that area A. And if this is a Q,</span> <span m='1051000'>and I am going to make
  it a Q because it is easier to do it</span> <span m='1056000'>that way, the area
  times the length then of this box is just</span> <span m='1062000'>the volume. Here
  is the volume.</span> </p><p><span m='1064000'>There is my expression for the pressure
  due to all of the</span> <span m='1069000'>molecule colliding with the front wall
  of that box.</span> </p><p><span m='1074000'>However, this is an expression for
  the pressure in one</span> <span m='1078000'>dimension only, the x dimension.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1083000'>And we know, in real life,</span> <span m='1085000'>we
  have three dimensions. We have to take care of that.</span> </p><p><span m='1090000'>Let's
  do that now. Let's extend this problem to</span> <span m='1094000'>three dimensions.
  To do so, I am just going to</span> <span m='1098000'>realize right here that the
  square of the velocity is the</span> <span m='1103000'>sum of the squares of the
  components.</span> </p><p><span m='1106000'>That, you understand. That is okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1111000'>What is not so obvious is this. The average of the square
  of</span> <span m='1117000'>the velocity is the sum of the average of the squares
  of each</span> <span m='1123000'>one of the components. That is true.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1127000'>You can prove that. We are not going to prove that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1132000'>I won't hold you responsible for proving that,</span> <span m='1137000'>but
  that is true. That is correct,</span> <span m='1141000'>but now here comes a critical
  assumption in Boltzmann's</span> <span m='1145000'>treatment. The critical assumption
  is that</span> <span m='1148000'>the motion of the molecules in this gas, here,</span>
  <span m='1152000'>is random in the sense that the molecules don't have a preferred</span>
  <span m='1156000'>direction. They are going in the x</span> <span m='1159000'>direction
  as often as they are going in the y direction as</span> <span m='1163000'>often
  as they are going in the z direction, so the motion is</span> <span m='1168000'>random.
  If that motion is random,</span> <span m='1172000'>then the average of the velocity
  squared in the x</span> <span m='1176000'>direction is going to be equal to that
  in the y direction.</span> </p><p><span m='1182000'>It is going to be equal to that
  in the z direction if that</span> <span m='1187000'>motion is random. And that is
  great because it is</span> <span m='1192000'>going to make things a little simpler
  for us up here.</span> </p><p><span m='1196000'>If that is right, then the average
  of the</span> <span m='1200000'>velocity squared is three times the average of the
  velocity</span> <span m='1206000'>squared in any one of the dimensions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1211000'>That is going to make it easy to extrapolate this to three</span> <span
  m='1216000'>dimensions because now I am going to be able to substitute,</span> <span
  m='1222000'>which had the average of the velocity squared only in the x</span> <span
  m='1228000'>direction, I am going to be able to substitute in an expression</span>
  <span m='1234000'>for the average velocity in three dimensions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1240000'>That is just going to be one-third that.</span> </p><p><span m='1243000'>This
  is going to be one-third the average of the velocity</span> <span m='1248000'>squared.
  That is great.</span> </p><p><span m='1250000'>Now, I am going to do that substitution
  way up into there.</span> </p><p><span m='1256000'>And when I do that, look at this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1260000'>I have a result. This is the kinetic theory</span> <span
  m='1264000'>result. We just did exactly what</span> <span m='1267000'>Maxwell did.
  We have an expression for the</span> <span m='1271000'>pressure times the volume,
  which is written here in terms</span> <span m='1276000'>of the average of the velocity
  squared of the molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1281000'>It is written in terms
  of the motion of the molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1288000'>For the first time,
  there is an understanding,</span> <span m='1291000'>here, of what gives rise to
  pressure, and that is the</span> <span m='1296000'>velocity or the motion of these
  molecules hitting the wall.</span> </p><p><span m='1301000'>That is great. That
  is the kinetic theory</span> <span m='1305000'>result. But now, Boltzmann also knew</span>
  <span m='1308000'>from experiment that P times V is equal to nRT.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1313000'>That is the experimental result, which had been known</span> <span m='1317000'>already
  for over a hundred years.</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>That is the experiment.
  If his theory is correct,</span> <span m='1327000'>if PV is equal to N m average
  velocity squared over three,</span> <span m='1334000'>it better be equal to nRT.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1340000'>That will give us, here, a prediction for what the</span>
  <span m='1346000'>velocity of the molecules ought to be in terms of something</span>
  <span m='1353000'>experimentally controllable. We can see if this kinetic</span>
  <span m='1360000'>theory model is correct. We can solve this for the</span> <span
  m='1365000'>average of the velocity squared. It is equal to 3n RT N over m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1372000'>We can go in the laboratory,</span> <span m='1377000'>vary
  T and see if, in fact, the average of the</span> <span m='1382000'>velocity squared
  of the molecules is equal to this</span> <span m='1387000'>expression here. That
  is great.</span> </p><p><span m='1391000'>We have a way to experimentally check
  this theory.</span> </p><p><span m='1396000'>And you also see, here, now, a relationship</span>
  <span m='1401000'>between the velocity of the molecules and this macroscopic</span>
  <span m='1406000'>quantity, temperature. Temperature is related to the</span> <span
  m='1412000'>motion of these molecules. But, before we go on,</span> <span m='1417000'>this
  is kind of a messy expression here.</span> </p><p><span m='1421000'>It has too many
  n's and m's in it.</span> </p><p><span m='1424000'>Let me simplify that a little
  bit for you.</span> </p><p><span m='1428000'>I am going to simplify this so that
  this is 3RT over capital M,</span> <span m='1434000'>where the following is true.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1440000'>Over here, n is the number of moles in the gas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1444000'>That is little n. Big N was the number of</span> <span
  m='1448000'>molecules in the gas. Little m was the mass per</span> <span m='1452000'>molecule.
  All of this is equivalent to</span> <span m='1455000'>one over big M, where big
  M was kilograms per</span> <span m='1460000'>mole. You can convince yourselves of</span>
  <span m='1463000'>this equality. I am taking all these N's and</span> <span m='1467000'>m's
  and making one big M.</span> </p><p><span m='1476000'>That is my expression, here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1478000'>I have the average of the velocity squared equal to 3RT</span>
  <span m='1482000'>over M. But this quantity is the</span> <span m='1487000'>average
  of the velocity squared. It is more convenient for us to</span> <span m='1492000'>talk
  about a quantity proportional to the velocity and</span> <span m='1497000'>not the
  velocity squared. What I am going to do is take</span> <span m='1502000'>the square
  root of it. That is simple.</span> </p><p><span m='1504000'>I now have the square
  root of the average of the velocity</span> <span m='1509000'>squared. That is the
  square root of 3RT</span> <span m='1512000'>over M. I am going to call that the</span>
  <span m='1514000'>root mean square velocity. I am going to put an rms here</span>
  <span m='1518000'>as a subscript for the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='1523000'>It
  is the root mean square velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='1525000'>I wanted to talk
  about a quantity proportional to the</span> <span m='1529000'>velocity, instead
  of the velocity squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1534000'>That is all I did there.
  That is the root mean square</span> <span m='1538000'>velocity. But the other big
  thing about</span> <span m='1541000'>it is you can see, for the first time,</span>
  <span m='1545000'>now we have got, and Maxwell had,</span> <span m='1547000'>an
  understanding of what temperature was.</span> </p><p><span m='1551000'>Temperature
  is related to the motions of the molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1556000'>Temperature
  is related, in this way,</span> <span m='1559000'>to the speed of the molecules.
  Those are the two important</span> <span m='1566000'>results. And this kinetic theory
  makes a</span> <span m='1571000'>prediction for what those velocities ought to be.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1586000'>In addition, the temperature is a measure of</span> <span
  m='1590000'>the kinetic energy of the molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1594000'>How
  is that? Well, it is for this reason.</span> </p><p><span m='1597000'>Here is the
  expression we derived from the kinetic theory.</span> </p><p><span m='1603000'>And
  then here is an expression that I just wrote down,</span> <span m='1607000'>that
  says the average kinetic energy of a molecule is one-half</span> <span m='1613000'>M,
  where M is kilograms per mole, times the average of the</span> <span m='1618000'>velocity
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1624000'>If I substitute the average of the velocity
  squared into here,</span> <span m='1629000'>I get three-halves RT.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1633000'>This is telling us, right here, that the</span> <span m='1636000'>temperature
  is also a measure of the kinetic energy of these</span> <span m='1642000'>molecules.
  We are getting a microscopic</span> <span m='1645000'>view, here, of what temperature
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>It is related to the motions of these molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1654000'>Now, before I go on talking about this, let me make one
  big</span> <span m='1660000'>point. That is, this expression here,</span> <span
  m='1663000'>for the average energy, notice that it is one-half M</span> <span m='1668000'>times
  the average of the velocity squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1673000'>It is not one-half
  M times the square of the average velocity</span> <span m='1679000'>This is important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1683000'>The average energy is not the square of the average velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1689000'>Rather, the average energy is the average of the velocity</span>
  <span m='1694000'>squared. There is a big distinction.</span> </p><p><span m='1697000'>This
  is because the average energy is the second moment of</span> <span m='1703000'>the
  velocity distribution function.</span> </p><p><span m='1706000'>Variables don't
  always correspond in a one-to-one</span> <span m='1711000'>manner. You don't have
  to understand</span> <span m='1716000'>that, if this is foreign to you, but I do
  want you to know this</span> <span m='1723000'>is correct. Now, let me pick up back
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1728000'>What I want you to notice is that the root
  mean square</span> <span m='1734000'>velocity has a mass dependence in it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1740000'>What does that mean? Well, it means the following.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1744000'>For some constant temperature, say we pick 300 degrees
  Kelvin,</span> <span m='1749000'>the velocity of the molecule is going to depend
  on its mass.</span> </p><p><span m='1754000'>And it is inversely proportional to
  the mass,</span> <span m='1758000'>so heavier molecules move more slowly, lighter
  molecules move</span> <span m='1763000'>more quickly. For example,</span> <span
  m='1765000'>helium at 300 degrees Kelvin, it is cruising along at 3</span> <span
  m='1770000'>miles per hour at room temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='1776000'>Xenon,
  on the other hand, which is much more massive,</span> <span m='1780000'>is moving
  at a measly 534 miles per hour.</span> </p><p><span m='1784000'>There is a mass
  dependence here.</span> </p><p><span m='1787000'>However, there is no mass dependence
  to the kinetic</span> <span m='1792000'>energy. The kinetic energy,</span> <span
  m='1794000'>we saw, was three-halves RT.</span> </p><p><span m='1798000'>You don't
  see a mass dependence in here, do you?</span> </p><p><span m='1804000'>The kinetic
  energy is only dependent on the temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='1809000'>Whether
  or not you have helium or xenon, the kinetic energy of</span> <span m='1815000'>those
  atoms is 3.74 kilojoules per mole at 300 degrees Kelvin.</span> </p><p><span m='1821000'>It
  does not matter that helium is moving six times as fast as</span> <span m='1826000'>xenon.
  They both have the same kinetic</span> <span m='1830000'>energy. There is no mass
  dependence in</span> <span m='1834000'>kinetic energy. Now you say,</span> <span
  m='1836000'>oh, but look at this, here is a mass,</span> <span m='1839000'>there
  is a mass dependence. No, because you have to</span> <span m='1843000'>remember
  that you substitute in here.</span> </p><p><span m='1846000'>If you square this,
  there is an M here,</span> <span m='1849000'>and that cancels. There is no mass
  dependence in</span> <span m='1853000'>the kinetic energy, but the velocity is dependent</span>
  <span m='1855000'>What Maxwell did was recognize No surprise.</span> <span m='1857000'>on
  the mass. That is important.</span> </p><p><span m='1861000'>Well, I told you that
  this was the kinetic theory result.</span> </p><p><span m='1867000'>That is, that
  the root mean square velocity of these</span> <span m='1872000'>molecules was represented
  by this equation.</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>And, from this equation, if you
  calculate at 300 degrees</span> <span m='1881000'>Kelvin, these are, in fact, the
  velocities of</span> <span m='1885000'>those atoms. But how do we know this is</span>
  <span m='1890000'>right? How do we go and measure the</span> <span m='1893000'>velocities
  or the speeds of molecules or atoms?</span> </p><p><span m='1898000'>Well, this
  is the way we do it. It is called the time-of-flight</span> <span m='1904000'>technique.
  Are we all on board,</span> <span m='1907000'>here? Questions?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1908000'>Okay. How are we going to do this</span> <span m='1911000'>time-of-flight
  technique? What we are going to do is we</span> <span m='1916000'>are going to have
  a little pinhole here that we can open</span> <span m='1922000'>and shut really
  quickly. We are going to let out a</span> <span m='1928000'>little pulse of gas.
  To measure the velocity of the</span> <span m='1932000'>molecules, we are literally
  going to measure the time it</span> <span m='1936000'>takes the molecules to fly
  from where we let them out to some</span> <span m='1941000'>detector. And since
  we know the distance,</span> <span m='1944000'>we are going to be able to calculate
  the velocity from</span> <span m='1948000'>that. The idea is at time t equals 0,</span>
  <span m='1952000'>we let out a little pulse of gas, and then we start a clock</span>
  <span m='1958000'>running. Then we just measure how long</span> <span m='1961000'>it
  takes the molecules to fly from this origin here to this</span> <span m='1966000'>detector.
  And since we built the</span> <span m='1969000'>apparatus, and we know what L is,
  we can calculate the</span> <span m='1974000'>velocity. Time-of-flight,</span> <span
  m='1976000'>that is what is done. However, when we let this</span> <span m='1982000'>little
  pulse of gas out, and now we let the molecules</span> <span m='1987000'>fly to that
  detector over here, what happens as a function of</span> <span m='1992000'>time?
  What will happen is that pulse</span> <span m='1995000'>of gas will spread out because
  not all of the molecules or</span> <span m='2001000'>atoms in that pulse of gas
  have the same velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='2005000'>Some of those atoms are
  moving faster than the other atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='2012000'>And so, what
  is going to happen is that the molecules or atoms</span> <span m='2016000'>that
  are moving faster are going to hit the detector first.</span> </p><p><span m='2021000'>The
  molecules or atoms that are moving more slowly are going to</span> <span m='2026000'>hit
  the detector at a later time.</span> </p><p><span m='2028000'>And that is what we
  also want to know, this distribution of</span> <span m='2033000'>velocities. But
  in the measurement,</span> <span m='2035000'>what we are going to measure is a distribution
  of times.</span> </p><p><span m='2041000'>Out of our detector, we are going to have
  a plot</span> <span m='2044000'>that looks like this. This is going to be f of t,</span>
  <span m='2048000'>essentially the number of molecules hitting the detector</span>
  <span m='2052000'>at a certain time t versus the time.</span> </p><p><span m='2055000'>When
  we first let our pulse of gas out, that is time t equals</span> <span m='2062000'>there
  are no molecules hitting the detector because it takes a</span> <span m='2066000'>while
  for them to get over here to this detector.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>But
  then, all of a sudden, they start reaching the</span> <span m='2075000'>detector.
  And this is essentially just a</span> <span m='2078000'>number of molecules that
  hit the detector as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='2083000'>That number
  of molecules increases and becomes a maximum</span> <span m='2087000'>here at some
  time, and then it exponentially</span> <span m='2090000'>decays, here. So, this
  is what we measure.</span> </p><p><span m='2093000'>This is a distribution here
  of flight times of the molecules in</span> <span m='2098000'>this pulse of gas.
  Well, that is nice,</span> <span m='2102000'>but this is a distribution of flight
  times.</span> </p><p><span m='2105000'>It is not a distribution of velocities, and
  we wanted a</span> <span m='2110000'>distribution of velocities. We want to know
  the velocity,</span> <span m='2114000'>here, of these molecules. You know how to
  convert time,</span> <span m='2119000'>given the path length, to velocity,</span>
  <span m='2122000'>but it is not so straightforward because we have</span> <span
  m='2125000'>a distribution function. We have a distribution in time,</span> <span
  m='2131000'>and we want to convert that to a distribution in velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2136000'>We have to change the variable here in a distribution function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2141000'>How do we do that? Well, we want this f of t to be</span>
  <span m='2145000'>an f of v. We recognize here that this</span> <span m='2150000'>distribution
  in time, the probability of finding a</span> <span m='2154000'>molecule between
  t and t plus dt, has got to be equivalent to</span> <span m='2159000'>the probability
  of finding a molecule with a velocity between</span> <span m='2164000'>v and v plus
  dv. But to get from one</span> <span m='2169000'>distribution function to another,
  for example,</span> <span m='2173000'>if we want f of v, what we have to know is
  how one</span> <span m='2180000'>variable changes with respect to another.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2190000'>We have this distribution function f of t,</span> <span
  m='2193000'>but we need to know how t changes with v.</span> </p><p><span m='2197000'>We
  need dt by dv, we need that,</span> <span m='2200000'>so let's get it. I will tell
  you why in a</span> <span m='2204000'>moment. We know how v changes with t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2207000'>We are going to take the derivative of v with respect to</span>
  <span m='2212000'>t and turn things around. So, dt / dv is proportional to</span>
  <span m='2218000'>minus t squared over L.</span> </p><p><span m='2224000'>This is
  telling us, essentially,</span> <span m='2226000'>how the variable t changes with
  v.</span> </p><p><span m='2229000'>To every point in our time-of-flight distribution,</span>
  <span m='2233000'>we are going to multiply this by this, what is called the</span>
  <span m='2237000'>Jacobean. We need this because the time</span> <span m='2240000'>and
  the velocity do not correlate in a one-to-one</span> <span m='2244000'>manner. That
  often happens with two</span> <span m='2247000'>distribution functions. If you do
  not understand what I</span> <span m='2253000'>just said, it is okay. This was just
  some extra.</span> </p><p><span m='2258000'>I do not hold you responsible for it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2262000'>I just changed my variable in the distribution function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2268000'>Yes? I think in the notes,</span> <span m='2270000'>I might
  have had as a proportionality.</span> </p><p><span m='2274000'>Up here I actually
  have the equal sign.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>That actually won't matter
  in this transformation.</span> </p><p><span m='2284000'>Pardon? I understand that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2286000'>That is fine. I don't have the equal sign</span> <span
  m='2290000'>there. That is why I left it out</span> <span m='2293000'>there, I think.
  Anyway, this is the velocity</span> <span m='2297000'>distribution. You don't have
  to understand</span> <span m='2300000'>how I got there. This is what the velocity</span>
  <span m='2304000'>distribution looks like. It is what is called the</span> <span
  m='2309000'>Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='2312000'>And
  the bottom line is that Maxwell and Boltzmann predicted</span> <span m='2316000'>this,
  about 1855. They actually predicted this</span> <span m='2320000'>distribution function.
  We did not predict it.</span> </p><p><span m='2323000'>We did not go through that
  part of kinetic theory,</span> <span m='2326000'>but they predicted it. However,
  it was only until</span> <span m='2330000'>that the technology existed, fast enough
  timing and</span> <span m='2334000'>electronics existed, to actually measure this</span>
  <span m='2337000'>experimentally. This took a hundred years or so</span> <span m='2342000'>in
  order for this distribution function to actually be</span> <span m='2347000'>measured,
  but here it is, f of v.</span> </p><p><span m='2350000'>First of all, there is all
  of this stuff,</span> <span m='2353000'>which is proportionality constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2356000'>We will talk about that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2359000'>But the variable, here, is v squared</span> <span m='2363000'>times
  an exponentially decaying function with a v squared in</span> <span m='2368000'>there.
  What does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='2371000'>Well, if you look at the form
  of f of v, this v squared is</span> <span m='2375000'>what gives rise to this increase
  in f of v.</span> </p><p><span m='2378000'>Right here, at low velocities, that is
  a quadratic,</span> <span m='2382000'>v squared. But you are multiplying it by</span>
  <span m='2385000'>an exponentially decaying function with this v squared in</span>
  <span m='2389000'>the argument. And so that is what gives you</span> <span m='2392000'>this
  tail. If you are multiplying a</span> <span m='2394000'>function that is going up
  and one decreasing,</span> <span m='2398000'>you are going to get a maximum at some
  value of v.</span> </p><p><span m='2403000'>That is where the shape of the Maxwell-Boltzmann
  distribution</span> <span m='2409000'>function comes from. And what this is telling
  you is</span> <span m='2414000'>the probability here of finding a molecule in a
  gas with a speed</span> <span m='2421000'>between v and v plus dv. That is what
  that is telling</span> <span m='2426000'>you. We often characterize these</span>
  <span m='2430000'>distribution functions by some quantities, and one of those</span>
  <span m='2435000'>quantities is what we call the most probable speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2439000'>Here is the distribution function, and I have the most</span> <span
  m='2444000'>probable speed labeled. The most probable speed,</span> <span m='2448000'>(v)mp,
  is simply the value of v at which the probability is the</span> <span m='2453000'>largest.
  That was like our most probable</span> <span m='2456000'>value of r in the radial
  distribution functions.</span> </p><p><span m='2462000'>That is what the most probable
  speed is.</span> </p><p><span m='2464000'>If you wanted to get that mathematically,</span>
  <span m='2467000'>what you would do is take this distribution function,</span> <span
  m='2471000'>take the derivative, set it equal to zero,</span> <span m='2474000'>and
  then solve for v. That makes that derivative</span> <span m='2478000'>equal to zero.
  The derivative is zero at</span> <span m='2481000'>maxima or minima. And then, you
  would find that</span> <span m='2484000'>the value of the most probable speed is
  the square root of 2RT</span> <span m='2489000'>over M.</span> </p><p><span m='2493000'>You
  are not responsible for taking this derivative and</span> <span m='2496000'>setting
  it equal to zero. You are responsible for knowing</span> <span m='2501000'>physically
  what the most probable speed is.</span> </p><p><span m='2504000'>The fact that it
  is this value here, where the probability is</span> <span m='2508000'>the largest.
  It is the most probable value</span> <span m='2511000'>of v. And you are responsible
  for</span> <span m='2514000'>recognizing this. I don't ask you to memorize it</span>
  <span m='2517000'>or to write it down. But, if you see it,</span> <span m='2521000'>you
  should know what it is. That is one quantity that we</span> <span m='2527000'>use
  to characterize this distribution function.</span> </p><p><span m='2531000'>Another
  quantity that we use is the average speed,</span> <span m='2536000'>v bar, average
  speed. And the first thing that you</span> <span m='2541000'>see is that the average
  speed is a little bit higher than the</span> <span m='2546000'>most probable speed.
  It is a little bit larger.</span> </p><p><span m='2551000'>Why is that? Well, it
  is a little bit larger</span> <span m='2555000'>because on these Maxwell-Boltzmann
  distribution</span> <span m='2558000'>functions, there are molecules way out here
  that have very high</span> <span m='2563000'>speeds. There are not a lot of</span>
  <span m='2565000'>molecules that have very high speeds, but there are molecules</span>
  <span m='2570000'>with very high speeds. And so, when you average over</span> <span
  m='2574000'>this distribution function, because there is such a long</span> <span
  m='2578000'>Boltzmann tail here, is what it is called,</span> <span m='2581000'>the
  average velocity is going to be a little higher than the</span> <span m='2585000'>most
  probable velocity. That is physically why the</span> <span m='2590000'>average velocity
  is a little bit larger than the most probable</span> <span m='2595000'>velocity.
  That is important.</span> </p><p><span m='2597000'>If I wanted to calculate what
  the average velocity is,</span> <span m='2600000'>I would take the distribution
  function, multiply it by v,</span> <span m='2604000'>and then integrate over the
  range of v, which is zero to</span> <span m='2608000'>infinity. You don't have to
  do that,</span> <span m='2612000'>but the quantity that you would get, if you had
  done that,</span> <span m='2616000'>is the square root of 8RT over pi M.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2621000'>It is larger than the most</span> <span m='2623000'>probable
  value. And then, finally,</span> <span m='2626000'>the other way we characterize
  the distribution function is by</span> <span m='2630000'>this root mean square speed
  that we have already talked about a</span> <span m='2635000'>lot. That root mean
  square speed,</span> <span m='2637000'>here, is even a larger value than the average
  velocity or the</span> <span m='2642000'>average speed. And the reason for that
  is,</span> <span m='2647000'>again, because of this Maxwell-Boltzmann tail.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2650000'>We have molecules here that have very high speeds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2654000'>We don't have a lot of molecules with high speeds,</span>
  <span m='2658000'>but we have very high speeds. When we take that speed and we</span>
  <span m='2662000'>square it, and then take the average, they make a big</span> <span
  m='2667000'>contribution, and they push this root mean</span> <span m='2670000'>square
  speed even higher than the average speed.</span> </p><p><span m='2675000'>Again,
  if you wanted to calculate what that is,</span> <span m='2678000'>you would take
  v squared, multiply it by the distribution</span> <span m='2683000'>function, integrate
  it over all values of E, and you would get</span> <span m='2689000'>what we got
  before, the square root of 3RT over M.</span> </p><p><span m='2693000'>Bottom line
  here,</span> <span m='2697000'>for argon at 300 degrees Kelvin, the most probable
  speed</span> <span m='2701000'>is 353 meters per second. For argon at 300 degrees</span>
  <span m='2707000'>Kelvin, the average speed is meters per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2711000'>And the root mean square speed is 433 meters per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2717000'>Here, you can see how these three quantities increase as you</span>
  <span m='2722000'>go from most probable to the root mean square speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2728000'>And, in fact, no surprise,</span> <span m='2731000'>if you actually
  go and measure the argon speeds distribution</span> <span m='2738000'>function and
  then evaluate these characteristics,</span> <span m='2744000'>you find that indeed
  those measurements agree with what Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='2751000'>Maxwell and
  Mr. Boltzmann predicted in 1850,</span> </p><p><span m='2760000'>Back to this distribution
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='2762000'>We saw how to characterize it, but I want
  to talk about a</span> <span m='2766000'>couple of other parameters that it has
  in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2770000'>It has in it the mass, and it has it in the</span>
  <span m='2773000'>temperature. Let's talk about what this</span> <span m='2776000'>distribution
  function looks like for different masses and</span> <span m='2780000'>different
  temperatures. That is the general form,</span> <span m='2784000'>but different masses
  and different temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m='2789000'>Let's start by keeping
  the temperature constant,</span> <span m='2792000'>300 degrees Kelvin. And now,
  we are going to look</span> <span m='2795000'>at the distribution functions for
  three different masses,</span> <span m='2799000'>and I am going to plot that. Here
  it is for xenon.</span> </p><p><span m='2803000'>What you can see is xenon, very
  narrow distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='2806000'>Here it is for argon, lighter
  mass,</span> <span m='2809000'>broader distribution. Here it is for helium,</span>
  <span m='2812000'>really broad distribution. Well, first of all,</span> <span m='2815000'>you
  can see that the average speed of helium is much greater</span> <span m='2819000'>than
  it is for argon, than it is for xenon.</span> </p><p><span m='2824000'>Because we
  already saw that it was inversely proportional to</span> <span m='2829000'>the square
  root of the mass. But the other thing to note is</span> <span m='2835000'>how broad
  the distribution is for helium compared to xenon.</span> </p><p><span m='2841000'>And
  that is the general case. The lighter masses have broader</span> <span m='2846000'>distributions.
  Helium is so broad,</span> <span m='2850000'>meaning that there are helium atoms
  here that are so fast that</span> <span m='2856000'>this is the reason why there
  is relatively little helium and</span> <span m='2861000'>hydrogen in our atmosphere.
  That is because,</span> <span m='2865000'>at our temperatures, there are enough
  molecules with</span> <span m='2869000'>high enough velocities to escape the earth's
  gravitational pull,</span> <span m='2875000'>because they are here at the tail end.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2880000'>And so, the helium and the hydrogen leave our atmosphere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2885000'>Unlike Jupiter, which is 300 times more massive</span>
  <span m='2889000'>than the earth, where the gravitational pull is</span> <span m='2894000'>greater.
  And, in that case,</span> <span m='2896000'>then those helium atoms don't have enough
  velocity to escape</span> <span m='2902000'>the earth's gravitational pull. So,
  that is mass.</span> </p><p><span m='2906000'>What about temperature? Now we are
  going to keep the</span> <span m='2912000'>mass constant and we are going to look
  at temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='2915000'>Here is the distribution function
  at 100 degrees Kelvin,</span> <span m='2919000'>pretty narrow. Here is the distribution</span>
  <span m='2922000'>function for argon at degrees Kelvin,</span> <span m='2925000'>broader.
  Here is the distribution</span> <span m='2927000'>function at 1000 degrees kelvin,
  broader again.</span> </p><p><span m='2930000'>You see that as we increase the temperature,
  the average speed</span> <span m='2935000'>increases. As we increase the temperature,</span>
  <span m='2938000'>the width of that distribution function increases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2943000'>Now, one thing to note here is this is a probability.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2947000'>The areas under these curves have to all add up to one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2952000'>If this distribution function is going to move to higher</span> <span
  m='2957000'>velocities as we increase the temperature, well,</span> <span m='2961000'>of
  course this maximum probability is going to have to</span> <span m='2966000'>go
  down because we cannot lose any molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2971000'>All the
  area under this curve, at 100 degrees Kelvin,</span> <span m='2975000'>has to equal
  the area under this curve, at 1000 degrees</span> <span m='2980000'>Kelvin, because
  this is a probability that we are plotting</span> <span m='2985000'>here. That is
  our description of the</span> <span m='2988582'>Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
  See you on Friday.</span> </p>
