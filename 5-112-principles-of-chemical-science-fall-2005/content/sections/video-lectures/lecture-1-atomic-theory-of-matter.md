  today is I am going to start talking</span> <span m='20000'>about the development
  of atomic theory.</span> </p><p><span m='23000'>I am going to whiz through what
  the evidence is for the</span> <span m='28000'>existence of atoms. And then, we
  are going to talk</span> <span m='33000'>about how the atom is not the most basic
  constituent of</span> <span m='38000'>matter, how the atom can be divided into at
  least an</span> <span m='42000'>electron and a nucleus. And then, what we are going
  to</span> <span m='46000'>see is how the existing classical way of thinking,</span>
  <span m='50000'>Newtonian mechanics, cannot explain how that</span> <span m='54000'>electron
  and that nucleus hangs together.</span> </p><p><span m='59000'>And later on in the
  course, we are going to see how that</span> <span m='62000'>existing classical physics
  is not going to be able to explain</span> <span m='66000'>how two atoms hang together.
  We are going to look at the</span> <span m='70000'>fundamental principles, here,
  of chemical bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='74000'>I am going to get going on this
  subject.</span> </p><p><span m='76000'>Then, about three-quarters of the way through,</span>
  <span m='79000'>I am going to stop. And then I will do some</span> <span m='82000'>introductions
  of our teaching team this semester.</span> </p><p><span m='87000'>And then also
  we will talk about the mechanics of the</span> <span m='91000'>course and some expectations
  of the course.</span> </p><p><span m='95000'>Let's get going. Certainly, the Ancient
  Greeks</span> <span m='100000'>were known to have pondered whether matter can be
  divided ad</span> <span m='105000'>infinitum into smaller and smaller pieces,</span>
  <span m='109000'>chopped up into smaller and smaller pieces,</span> <span m='113000'>or
  whether there was a point at which you couldn't chop up</span> <span m='118000'>matter
  any further. Aristotle over here was one of</span> <span m='124000'>those philosophers
  who believed that matter was infinitely</span> <span m='129000'>divisible. You could
  chop it up ad</span> <span m='132000'>infinitum. This is called the continuum</span>
  <span m='135000'>theory of matter. It is a continuum.</span> </p><p><span m='139000'>There
  is no discreteness to matter.</span> </p><p><span m='142000'>That was his view of
  the structure of matter,</span> <span m='145000'>but there was a minority opinion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='150000'>An opinion actually held by Democritus who was 100 years</span>
  <span m='155000'>older than Aristotle. And Democritus believed that</span> <span
  m='160000'>matter was composed of discrete particles called,</span> <span m='164000'>in
  Greek, "atomos," "a" meaning not, "tomos" meaning divisible,</span> <span m='170000'>not
  divisible particles. Well, for whatever reason,</span> <span m='175000'>Aristotle's
  continuum theory of matter prevailed all the way up</span> <span m='181000'>to the
  17th century. And here he is depicted by</span> <span m='187000'>Raphael, the frescos
  on the walls in the Vatican holding</span> <span m='192000'>court on the continuum
  theory of matter.</span> </p><p><span m='196000'>But at the same time that Raphael
  actually painted this</span> <span m='201000'>picture, there were beginning to accumulate
  some observations</span> <span m='207000'>about how matter behaved and how it reacted
  that did not quite</span> <span m='212000'>jive with this continuum theory of matter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='218000'>And what were those observations?</span> </p><p><span m='220000'>Well,
  one of those observations was by this gentleman,</span> <span m='225000'>Robert
  Boyle. Guess what his profession was.</span> </p><p><span m='228000'>Chemist? Good
  guess.</span> </p><p><span m='230000'>He was actually a theologian, as most chemists
  were at that</span> <span m='235000'>time. You know him largely for the</span> <span
  m='238000'>empirical observation that if you take the pressure times the</span>
  <span m='243000'>volume of a gas, it is always a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='248000'>At
  least when the temperature is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='251000'>But Robert
  Boyle also put forth probably the first idea of an</span> <span m='256000'>element.
  And he called elements certain</span> <span m='259000'>primitive unmingled bodies.
  And he also put forth the idea</span> <span m='264000'>that these unmingled bodies
  were the ingredients of perfectly</span> <span m='270000'>mixed bodies. Just a pseudonym
  for molecules,</span> <span m='274000'>for compounds. And then there is the work
  of</span> <span m='278000'>this gentleman, Joseph Priestley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='281000'>Guess what his occupation was. Right, he was a priest.</span> </p><p><span
  m='286000'>And what he did was he carried out some reactions of</span> <span m='291000'>dephlogisticated
  air with various materials.</span> </p><p><span m='295000'>And what he found was
  that materials reacted more</span> <span m='299000'>vigorously in dephlogisticated
  air than they did in</span> <span m='304000'>undephlogisticated air. And, of course,</span>
  <span m='309000'>dephlogisticated air is nothing other than oxygen.</span> </p><p><span
  m='312000'>It is the air with the nitrogen removed from it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='316000'>But it really took this gentleman, Lavoisier,</span> <span m='319000'>to
  understand what Priestley's experiments were all about.</span> </p><p><span m='324000'>And
  what Lavoisier realized is that when materials were</span> <span m='328000'>reacting
  with this dephlogisticated air,</span> <span m='331000'>this dephlogisticated air
  was kind of adding to the material.</span> </p><p><span m='337000'>And he came to
  that conclusion because he did some very careful</span> <span m='342000'>measurements
  of the mass of the dephlogisticated air plus the</span> <span m='347000'>material
  before the reaction and some careful measurements after.</span> </p><p><span m='353000'>And
  found that they were indeed equal.</span> </p><p><span m='356000'>There was a conservation
  of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='360000'>And from that Lavoisier was really the first
  person to</span> <span m='364000'>realize that a chemical reaction was analogous
  to an algebraic</span> <span m='370000'>equation. He also went on to isolate 17</span>
  <span m='373000'>different metals and identified them as elements and nine</span>
  <span m='378000'>different nonmetals and identified them as elements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='383000'>But for all of his efforts, well, we all know what happened</span> <span
  m='388000'>to him. He was advisor to the French</span> <span m='392000'>Monarchy.
  The judge at his trial</span> <span m='394000'>proclaimed the Republic has no use
  for Savants.</span> </p><p><span m='398000'>LaGrange, who was a mathematician at
  that time,</span> <span m='402000'>said, "It took but a moment to cut off that head,</span>
  <span m='406000'>though 100 years will be required to produce another like</span>
  <span m='411000'>it." Well, here we have some observations and we have some</span>
  <span m='415000'>observations -- Oh, I forgot one other person</span> <span m='420000'>here.
  That's this guy,</span> <span m='422000'>J. L.</span> </p><p><span m='423000'>Proust.
  J.</span> </p><p><span m='424000'>L. Proust was also a French</span> <span m='426000'>scientist
  at that time, but he was a little more</span> <span m='431000'>politically savvy.
  And so he high-tailed it out of</span> <span m='435000'>France and lived a long
  and productive life as a professor</span> <span m='441000'>in Madrid. And what he
  did were</span> <span m='444000'>experiments. He recognized from the results</span>
  <span m='449000'>that when two elements combine to form a given compound,</span>
  <span m='454000'>they always did so in definite proportions by weight,</span> <span
  m='458000'>regardless of what kind of method of preparation he used to</span> <span
  m='463000'>make that particular compound. Here is an example where matter</span>
  <span m='468000'>didn't quite behave as a continuum.</span> </p><p><span m='471000'>There
  was a discreteness of some sense to matter.</span> </p><p><span m='476000'>And it
  really took John Dalton, an English schoolteacher with</span> <span m='483000'>broad
  interests, to realize, or to recognize</span> <span m='488000'>these observations
  of Priestley, of Lavoisier,</span> <span m='493000'>of Proust that he could understand
  all of these</span> <span m='499000'>observations if he resurrected the idea of
  Democritus,</span> <span m='505000'>the idea of atomos, or atoms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='510000'>And so he forth some postulates.</span> </p><p><span m='512000'>Well,
  those postulates are now known as Dalton's Atomic Theory,</span> <span m='516000'>but
  they were postulates at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='519000'>And those postulates
  say each element is composed of atoms,</span> <span m='524000'>atoms of a given
  element are identical and that compounds</span> <span m='528000'>form when atoms
  of more than one element combine.</span> </p><p><span m='531000'>And, of course,
  that atoms are not created or</span> <span m='535000'>destroyed. And then, just
  an aside,</span> <span m='539000'>Dalton, with his very broad range of interest,</span>
  <span m='543000'>was also really the first person to document</span> <span m='546000'>colorblindness
  in humans. Colorblindness is also called</span> <span m='551000'>Daltonism. You
  see, we are getting you set</span> <span m='555000'>for medical school already.
  But I want you to recognize</span> <span m='559000'>here that Dalton didn't actually
  do any of these experiments</span> <span m='564000'>himself. I think he could have,</span>
  <span m='567000'>but he didn't. Instead he just said that if</span> <span m='572000'>Lavoisier
  was right and Proust's observations are right,</span> <span m='577000'>well, then
  I can understand those observations in terms of</span> <span m='582000'>this framework
  of postulates. And I point this out because</span> <span m='587000'>this is a powerful
  method in science, a powerful way in which</span> <span m='593000'>science works
  in that there are often some observations</span> <span m='598000'>seemingly disparate.
  And then somebody comes along</span> <span m='603000'>and recognizes a unifying
  factor.</span> </p><p><span m='605000'>In this case, the presence of atoms or</span>
  <span m='608000'>discrete particles. Now, of course,</span> <span m='611000'>Dalton's
  Atomic Theory here was not immediately accepted.</span> </p><p><span m='616000'>And
  rightfully so. It needed further</span> <span m='618000'>substantiation. And that
  further substantiation</span> <span m='622000'>came in the form of work by this
  gentleman, Joseph Gay-Lussac,</span> <span m='627000'>the Law of Combining Volumes.
  It came in the form of work by</span> <span m='633000'>Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo
  Avogadro's hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span m='637000'>And here I want you to realize
  that, even though you didn't</span> <span m='642000'>know it, you indeed can read
  Italian.</span> </p><p><span m='645000'>It says "equal volumes of gases under the
  same conditions of</span> <span m='650000'>temperature yield the same number of
  molecules or atoms."</span> <span m='655000'>There you go. That is from an Italian
  stamp.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>You can read Italian. And that further substantiation</span>
  <span m='664000'>came from the work of this gentleman, Ludwig Boltzmann,</span>
  <span m='669000'>gas kinetic theory, who recognized - you know - the</span> <span
  m='673000'>pressure of a gas that must be due to individual particles that</span>
  <span m='678000'>are moving and that are ramming into the walls of some vessel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='684000'>That must be what gives rise to pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='687000'>And then, finally, it took a statesman,</span> <span m='690000'>Cannizzaro.
  And what Cannizzaro did was he</span> <span m='696000'>got the scientific establishment
  at that time,</span> <span m='700000'>and the scientific establishment at that time
  for</span> <span m='705000'>sure was a small group of pale males, to listen to Dalton's</span>
  <span m='711000'>Atomic Theory and to the supporting data from Avogadro</span> <span
  m='716000'>and company. And ultimately got them to say,</span> <span m='722000'>yes,
  there is something to it here.</span> </p><p><span m='725000'>And so by the late
  1800s, the idea of atoms was pretty</span> <span m='731000'>strongly ingrained in
  the scientific community.</span> </p><p><span m='736000'>Now, of course nowadays
  we can actually see individual atoms</span> <span m='742000'>for molecules. And
  so here is a picture of 28</span> <span m='748000'>individual CO molecules arranged
  in the form of a little man or a</span> <span m='754000'>little woman, I don't know
  which.</span> </p><p><span m='758000'>And each one of these CO molecules is an orange
  ball.</span> </p><p><span m='763000'>And what you are looking at are these CO molecules
  bound to a</span> <span m='770000'>platinum surface. They are bound to a platinum</span>
  <span m='774000'>surface such that the carbon end is down and the oxygen end is</span>
  <span m='781000'>up. And there is a really good</span> <span m='784000'>reason why
  the carbon end is down and the oxygen end is up.</span> </p><p><span m='789000'>And
  Professor Cummins, whom I am going to introduce to</span> <span m='793000'>you in
  a few minutes, is going to talk to you about</span> <span m='796000'>what that really
  good reason is in the second half of the</span> <span m='800000'>course. We know
  why this is case.</span> </p><p><span m='803000'>What you are looking at here is
  really looking at the oxygen end</span> <span m='807000'>of the CO molecule, because
  we are looking at a top</span> <span m='811000'>view. All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='813000'>How is this image made? Well, this image was made by a</span> <span m='818000'>technique
  called scanning tunneling microscopy that was</span> <span m='822000'>invented before
  you were born, I am sorry to say.</span> </p><p><span m='826000'>I am sorry for
  myself to say. It was worked on by Ruska and</span> <span m='831000'>then perfected
  by Binnig and Rohrer.</span> </p><p><span m='834000'>And they earned themselves
  a Nobel Prize for this work.</span> </p><p><span m='840000'>And the way this techniques
  works is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='844000'>What you are going to do
  is take a thin tungsten wire.</span> </p><p><span m='850000'>It might be 0.01 inches
  in diameter.</span> </p><p><span m='853000'>And you etch it down to a fine tip.</span>
  </p><p><span m='856000'>You stick it in some potassium hydroxide, do a little</span>
  <span m='862000'>electrochemistry and etch it down to as fine a tip as you can</span>
  <span m='868000'>make it. Then you attach that tungsten</span> <span m='872000'>wire
  to something called a piezoelectric crystal.</span> </p><p><span m='877000'>And
  a piezoelectric material is one in which,</span> <span m='881000'>if you put a voltage
  across it, you can make it expand a little</span> <span m='887000'>bit, 10, 20 angstroms
  or so. And if you can make it expand a</span> <span m='892000'>little bit like that,
  well, then you've got control</span> <span m='897000'>on an angstrom-type level.
  You attach it to some</span> <span m='902000'>piezoelectric crystal here then it
  allows you to move that</span> <span m='908000'>tungsten tip by a very, very small
  amount.</span> </p><p><span m='912000'>You bring that tungsten tip close to the
  top of this CO</span> <span m='917000'>molecule sitting on this platinum surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='920000'>And say you bring it to within, oh, I don't know,</span>
  <span m='925000'>5 angstroms or so from the oxygen atom.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>Now,
  the tungsten has electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='933000'>And since this is a bulk
  metal, some of those electrons are not</span> <span m='940000'>firmly attached to
  a particular nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='945000'>There is a sea of electrons.
  And what we are going to do is</span> <span m='951000'>put a negative potential
  on that tungsten tip.</span> </p><p><span m='958000'>And we are going to ground
  here this platinum surface.</span> </p><p><span m='962000'>Now, these electrons
  on the tungsten, they are in this</span> <span m='966000'>environment of a negative
  potential.</span> </p><p><span m='969000'>And that is a high-energy state for them
  because they are</span> <span m='973000'>negatively charged particles. If I were
  to draw here an</span> <span m='978000'>energy level diagram, I am going to represent
  then</span> <span m='982000'>the energy level of the electrons here in this tungsten,</span>
  <span m='986000'>around this tungsten tip as some high energy over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='992000'>There are electrons on the tungsten.</span> </p><p><span
  m='994000'>Whereas, the electrons associated with the platinum and</span> <span
  m='998000'>the CO here, all of which are in contact with each other,</span> <span
  m='1002000'>well, they are at ground. That is a lower energy state</span> <span
  m='1006000'>for these negatively charged particles.</span> </p><p><span m='1009000'>We
  are going to represent it by this.</span> </p><p><span m='1012000'>This is the electrons
  on platinum.</span> </p><p><span m='1015000'>And so this axis here is kind of a
  distance access.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>These are the electrons on the
  tip.</span> </p><p><span m='1023000'>These are the electrons on the platinum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1026000'>We are measuring kind of distance here,</span> <span m='1030000'>from
  here to here, in the vertical direction</span> <span m='1033000'>there. There is
  a thermodynamic</span> <span m='1036000'>driving force for the electrons on the
  tungsten tip to want to</span> <span m='1042000'>be here on the platinum, but the
  problem is that this</span> <span m='1046000'>tungsten is not in contact with this
  oxygen end here.</span> </p><p><span m='1053000'>There is a gap. And if this is
  in a vacuum,</span> <span m='1056000'>we call this a vacuum gap. And so for an electron
  to be</span> <span m='1061000'>inside of this vacuum gap, well, that is a very high</span>
  <span m='1065000'>energy state for those electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='1068000'>And
  so, if we were to look at an energy level diagram here,</span> <span m='1073000'>that
  energy actually goes up pretty high before it comes back</span> <span m='1078000'>down.
  There is a barrier to getting</span> <span m='1082000'>the electrons from the tip
  to the platinum surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1087000'>Well, you have seen this
  kind of reaction coordinate before.</span> </p><p><span m='1092000'>You have, I
  am sure. If you look at an energy level</span> <span m='1096000'>diagram here for
  some reactions, sometimes you have reactants</span> <span m='1102000'>here at a
  high energy and products here at a lower energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1108000'>And,
  in order to get from reactants to products,</span> <span m='1111000'>there is a
  barrier, an activation energy barrier.</span> </p><p><span m='1115000'>You called
  it E(act) or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1118000'>And you know that
  in chemical reactions typically what you</span> <span m='1123000'>have got to do
  is put energy into the system in order to get</span> <span m='1127000'>over this
  barrier before you get any energy out,</span> <span m='1131000'>before the reaction
  can proceed.</span> </p><p><span m='1133000'>And that is what happens in a lot of
  chemical reactions.</span> </p><p><span m='1139000'>There is a barrier and you have
  got to supply that energy to get</span> <span m='1144000'>over it before you can
  make the reaction go.</span> </p><p><span m='1148000'>But over here, in the case
  of electrons,</span> <span m='1152000'>those electrons don't act like atoms and
  molecules do,</span> <span m='1156000'>for the most part. These electrons,</span>
  <span m='1159000'>what do they do? They ignore this barrier and</span> <span m='1163000'>tunnel
  right through the barrier, go right through that</span> <span m='1168000'>brick
  wall. How can they do that?</span> </p><p><span m='1172000'>Well, they can do that
  because they are quantum mechanical</span> <span m='1177000'>particles. We cannot
  treat those electrons</span> <span m='1180000'>like we treat atoms and molecules
  which,</span> <span m='1184000'>for the most part, behave as classical particles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1188000'>And, actually, this is going to be the subject</span> <span
  m='1191000'>of the first few lectures here, the need for this new kind of</span>
  <span m='1196000'>mechanics to explain phenomenon like this and to explain</span>
  <span m='1201000'>chemical bonding. All right.</span> </p><p><span m='1204000'>So,
  these electrons tunnel right through.</span> </p><p><span m='1208000'>What does
  that mean? Well, what that means here,</span> <span m='1213000'>for this experiment,
  is that if I then take and</span> <span m='1217000'>attach a wire to the tungsten
  tip and a wire to the platinum</span> <span m='1222000'>surface and I put an ammeter
  in between, I will see a</span> <span m='1227000'>measurement of a current. There
  are electrons going from</span> <span m='1233000'>this tungsten tip to this platinum
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1237000'>I measure a current. Well, that is nice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1241000'>But now, from that, how do I get this image of</span> <span
  m='1245000'>these 28 CO molecules? Well, what I do is I also have</span> <span m='1250000'>this
  tungsten tip mounted not only on a piezoelectric crystal</span> <span m='1255000'>that
  allows me to go up and down.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>But another piezoelectric
  crystal, which allows me to move</span> <span m='1264000'>it from side to side with
  control on the order of an</span> <span m='1268000'>angstrom. I can take the tungsten
  tip and</span> <span m='1271000'>I am going to move it over by a certain amount.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1275000'>And exactly I am going to know that certain amount is because
  I</span> <span m='1280000'>calibrated my piezoelectric crystal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1282000'>But now, when I move that tungsten tip over,</span> <span m='1286000'>what
  is going to happen to this current here?</span> </p><p><span m='1291000'>Pardon?
  It is going to go down.</span> </p><p><span m='1293000'>It is going to plummet.
  It is going to go to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1297000'>Why? Because when I move
  this tip</span> <span m='1299000'>over, I increase the distance between the end
  of the tip and</span> <span m='1304000'>the oxygen onto the molecule. And when I
  increase the</span> <span m='1308000'>distance, what I do is make this barrier wider.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1311000'>And the wider the barrier is, the more difficult it is
  for</span> <span m='1316000'>those electrons to tunnel through.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1320000'>And so the current actually goes down.</span> </p><p><span m='1323000'>To
  compensate for that, I am now going to take the</span> <span m='1328000'>tungsten
  tip and move it down by just enough such that I</span> <span m='1334000'>reestablish
  the current that I originally have.</span> </p><p><span m='1339000'>And, of course,
  I know exactly by how much I</span> <span m='1343000'>moved it down because, again,
  I have my tip</span> <span m='1347000'>calibrated. I've got two points now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1352000'>I need a third point. I am going to take that</span> <span
  m='1355000'>tungsten tip and I am going to move it over again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1360000'>Again, the current is going to go down.</span> </p><p><span m='1363000'>But,
  in order to reestablish the original current I had,</span> <span m='1368000'>I am
  going to move this down further.</span> </p><p><span m='1371000'>And, again, I will
  know how much I move the tip over and I</span> <span m='1376000'>will know exactly
  how much I move the tip down.</span> </p><p><span m='1382000'>To get that image,
  I am going to provide a color</span> <span m='1385000'>code. I am going to say that
  when the</span> <span m='1388000'>tungsten tip is the largest distance away from
  the surface,</span> <span m='1392000'>well, then that is going to show up here on
  this picture and</span> <span m='1397000'>it is going to show up as a very light
  color.</span> </p><p><span m='1400000'>That is the highest points. When the tungsten
  tip is a</span> <span m='1404000'>little bit closer to the surface, well,</span>
  <span m='1407000'>that is going to show up as the darker colors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1412000'>And, as it gets lower and lower and lower, it is going to be</span>
  <span m='1417000'>deeper and deeper orangey. Finally, when I am actually</span>
  <span m='1422000'>tunneling to the platinum surface, instead of a CO</span> <span
  m='1427000'>molecule, I am going to make that a blue color.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1431000'>That is how we get the image of this molecular man.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1436000'>Now, you do see that these CO molecules are in the form of a</span>
  <span m='1442000'>little person. This does not represent,</span> <span m='1447000'>in
  the most au courant language, intelligent design.</span> </p><p><span m='1452000'>Rather,
  this represents the work of a very patient</span> <span m='1457000'>experimentalist,
  i.e., graduate student,</span> <span m='1461000'>who spent 24 hours, and I know
  this to be the case,</span> <span m='1466000'>moving these CO molecules into this
  particular arrangement.</span> </p><p><span m='1473000'>How did he do that? Well,
  how he did that is the</span> <span m='1476000'>following. What he did was took
  this</span> <span m='1478000'>platinum surface and then opened up a bottle of CO
  in the vacuum</span> <span m='1483000'>chamber, or let some CO into the vacuum chamber,</span>
  <span m='1486000'>and the molecules just absorbed anywhere they wanted to,</span>
  <span m='1490000'>well, sort of anywhere they wanted to on this platinum</span>
  <span m='1494000'>surface. First of all,</span> <span m='1495000'>he had to figure
  out where the molecules were.</span> </p><p><span m='1500000'>The soccer balls are
  the CO molecules and the tungsten tip</span> <span m='1505000'>here is my leg and
  my foot. And so the first thing he did</span> <span m='1510000'>was scan the surface
  in order to figure out where the CO</span> <span m='1515000'>molecules are and goes,
  okay, I know where they are.</span> </p><p><span m='1520000'>Then he brought this
  tip down right next to one of the CO</span> <span m='1526000'>molecules. Then he
  gave that piezoelectric</span> <span m='1530000'>crystal a pulse of voltage which
  jerked it and the CO molecule</span> <span m='1535000'>went flying away. Well, that
  is nice,</span> <span m='1537000'>but now where is it? Again, you have got to go
  scan</span> <span m='1541000'>along the whole surface to find it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1544000'>Well, he pushed it over too far.</span> </p><p><span m='1546000'>Now
  we have got to come over here, put the tip down,</span> <span m='1550000'>give another
  voltage pulse before his tip breaks.</span> </p><p><span m='1554000'>Well, you get
  the idea. 24 hours later,</span> <span m='1557000'>you've got it. This is the beginnings
  of</span> <span m='1562000'>nanotechnology. You can see that it is going to</span>
  <span m='1567000'>be a long time before manipulation of individual atoms</span>
  <span m='1572000'>and molecules like this, one at a time,</span> <span m='1576000'>before
  that competes effectively with synthesis in a</span> <span m='1581000'>beaker where
  you get the molecules right where you want</span> <span m='1587000'>them because
  of chemistry instead of this mechanical</span> <span m='1592000'>manipulation. Well,
  even though 100 years ago</span> <span m='1598000'>these direct observations of
  atoms and molecules was not</span> <span m='1606000'>possible, it was by the late
  1800s pretty well accepted,</span> <span m='1613000'>or the evidence for the atomic
  structure of matter,</span> <span m='1619000'>atoms as the most basic constituent
  of matter,</span> <span m='1625000'>that evidence was really pretty compelling.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1632000'>And, in fact, by the late 1800s,</span> <span m='1634000'>it
  was basically believed that the theoretical structure of the</span> <span m='1640000'>universe
  was complete. Nature was understood.</span> </p><p><span m='1644000'>There were
  no big discoveries to be made yet.</span> </p><p><span m='1649000'>And, in fact,
  there was some justification</span> <span m='1652000'>for that attitude, because
  certainly by the late</span> <span m='1656000'>1800s Newtonian mechanics, the mechanics
  that described</span> <span m='1660000'>how bodies all around us moved, including
  astronomical bodies,</span> <span m='1665000'>well, that had already been known
  for over 200 years.</span> </p><p><span m='1669000'>Thermodynamics was formulated
  already by that time.</span> </p><p><span m='1673000'>Statistical mechanics was
  also formulated by that time.</span> </p><p><span m='1679000'>Statistical mechanics
  is a field that relates the</span> <span m='1683000'>microscopic description of
  matter to the macroscopic</span> <span m='1688000'>behavior of matter. And, very
  importantly,</span> <span m='1692000'>there were experiments by Young, Fresnel and
  Hertz that</span> <span m='1697000'>seemed to put to rest the notion that light
  was a particle.</span> </p><p><span m='1703000'>Those experiments really nailed,
  or seemed to nail the</span> <span m='1708000'>idea of light as a wave, light has
  wavelike particles.</span> </p><p><span m='1715000'>They verified Maxwell's equations
  that unified the</span> <span m='1720000'>fields of optics and electromagnetism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1724000'>All of these accomplishments surely did justify a very
  proud</span> <span m='1730000'>feeling amongst the scientific community.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1736000'>And, at that time, the feeling was that the work</span>
  <span m='1740000'>that remained was largely to investigate the next decimal</span>
  <span m='1745000'>place and that is it. Well, if you look really</span> <span m='1750000'>carefully,
  though, at the evidence,</span> <span m='1753000'>even with all of these accomplishments,</span>
  <span m='1757000'>there were beginning to be, in the late 1800s,</span> <span m='1761000'>some
  experiments that were suggesting that,</span> <span m='1765000'>one, maybe the atom
  was not the most basic constituent of</span> <span m='1770000'>matter. That was
  the first set of</span> <span m='1775000'>measurements that indicated something
  was amiss,</span> <span m='1779000'>the fact that the atom wasn't the most elementary
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='1784000'>And we are going to look at these sets
  of measurements.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>Second, the other observation that
  hinted that this classical</span> <span m='1793000'>thinking as amiss was the observation
  of the photoelectric</span> <span m='1798000'>effect. Because the photoelectric</span>
  <span m='1802000'>effect, what it did was it showed that light was behaving</span>
  <span m='1807000'>like a particle and not a wave, and that sent a lot of</span>
  <span m='1812000'>consternation throughout the scientific community.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1817000'>We are going to look at these two tracks.</span> </p><p><span m='1821000'>And
  we are going to start by talking about the fact that the</span> <span m='1827000'>atom
  is not the most basic constituent of matter.</span> </p><p><span m='1833000'>That
  at least you can divide the atom up into an electron and</span> <span m='1838000'>a
  nucleus. We are going to start here with</span> <span m='1842000'>this gentleman,
  J.J.</span> </p><p><span m='1843000'>Thompson. Remember that name.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1846000'>It is going to come back. Discovery of the electron.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1850000'>This is 1897. What J.J.</span> </p><p><span m='1852000'>Thompson was
  interested in doing was understanding what a</span> <span m='1857000'>discharge
  was, or what made up a discharge.</span> </p><p><span m='1863000'>For example, if
  you have a glass vessel that</span> <span m='1867000'>you evacuate and then you
  have a cathode in that glass vessel and</span> <span m='1872000'>you have an anode
  in that glass vessel, and you also put some</span> <span m='1878000'>molecular hydrogen
  in it, fill it up with molecular</span> <span m='1883000'>hydrogen. But now what
  you do is put a</span> <span m='1886000'>negative voltage on the cathode and a positive
  voltage on the</span> <span m='1892000'>anode. And you crank up the potential</span>
  <span m='1896000'>energy difference, the voltage difference between</span> <span
  m='1899000'>the cathode and the anode. And you keep cranking it up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1903000'>You have to get really pretty high, but at some point all of a</span>
  <span m='1907000'>sudden what happens is that the gas here begins to blow.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1911000'>And you get the establishment of this discharge,</span>
  <span m='1914000'>this plasma. And J.J.</span> </p><p><span m='1916000'>Thompson
  was just interested in finding out what was in this</span> <span m='1920000'>plasma.
  What he did to investigate it</span> <span m='1924000'>is he punched a hole in this
  anode right here and let out a</span> <span m='1930000'>little bit of this plasma.
  He let it impinge on a kind of</span> <span m='1935000'>phosphor screen here. Even
  though the plasma leaking</span> <span m='1940000'>out was kind of glowing in the
  dark, well, it also was glowing</span> <span m='1946000'>when it hit the phosphor
  screen. That lit up.</span> </p><p><span m='1951000'>But then he took a pair of
  parallel metal plates above and</span> <span m='1958000'>below this luminous beam
  and put a potential difference on them,</span> <span m='1965000'>some delta V. And
  this delta V is just a</span> <span m='1969000'>fraction of what this delta V is,
  so it is very small.</span> </p><p><span m='1977000'>But what he noticed is that
  some of this luminous beam was</span> <span m='1981000'>actually attracted toward
  that positively charged plate.</span> </p><p><span m='1986000'>And so, if you have
  got something that is attracted to</span> <span m='1991000'>this positively charged
  plate, what does it mean about this</span> <span m='1996000'>particle? It is negatively
  charged.</span> </p><p><span m='1999000'>It is just Coulomb's interaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2002000'>And he could measure right here the amount of deflection
  from</span> <span m='2007000'>the center line. I am going to call that amount</span>
  <span m='2012000'>of deflection delta X sub minus to indicate that</span> <span
  m='2018000'>this looks like a negatively charged particle.</span> </p><p><span m='2022000'>Now,
  Thompson also knew enough electromagnetism at that time to</span> <span m='2027000'>realize
  that the amount of that deflection has to be directly</span> <span m='2033000'>proportional
  to the charge on that particle.</span> </p><p><span m='2038000'>In other words,
  the greater the charge the</span> <span m='2041000'>larger the deflection. I am
  going to represent that</span> <span m='2046000'>charge by E sub minus. He also
  recognized that the</span> <span m='2051000'>heavier that particle, the more difficult
  it is going</span> <span m='2055000'>to be to deflect the particle to the positively
  charged plate.</span> </p><p><span m='2061000'>That amount of deflection is going
  to be inversely</span> <span m='2065000'>proportional to the mass of that negatively
  charged particle.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>But then Thompson did a further
  experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='2075000'>He increased delta V even more. And
  here, I am taking a little</span> <span m='2080000'>liberty with the story. It is
  a little bit more</span> <span m='2084000'>complicated, but I am just trying to
  get the essence here</span> <span m='2089000'>across. He cranked this up some more.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2092000'>And then, if you looked really, really carefully,</span>
  <span m='2096000'>what happened is he also saw some of this being deflected</span>
  <span m='2101000'>toward the negatively charged plate.</span> </p><p><span m='2106000'>Indicating
  that, lo and behold,</span> <span m='2108000'>there must also be some positively
  charged particles in</span> <span m='2114000'>this luminous beam. And he called
  that deflection</span> <span m='2118000'>delta X sub plus. Again, the amount of
  deflection</span> <span m='2125000'>for the positively charged particles has to
  be proportional</span> <span m='2130000'>to the charge on that positively charged
  particle and inversely</span> <span m='2136000'>proportional to the mass of that
  positively charged particle.</span> </p><p><span m='2144000'>But the other critical
  observation that he made was</span> <span m='2149000'>that the amount of deflection
  for a given voltage,</span> <span m='2154000'>for that negatively charged particle
  was much,</span> <span m='2159000'>much larger that the amount of deflection for
  the positively</span> <span m='2165000'>charged particle. That is the evidence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2170000'>Now we have to think. Now we have to make some</span> <span
  m='2175000'>guesses. What he guessed is that the</span> <span m='2179000'>positively
  charged particles here were H plus.</span> </p><p><span m='2185000'>How did he know
  that? Well, what he did know is that</span> <span m='2191000'>in this plasma there
  were some neutral hydrogen atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='2195000'>He knew that.
  How he knew that I am going to</span> <span m='2199000'>tell you, or we are going
  to talk about in a few days.</span> </p><p><span m='2203000'>But he knew that this
  plasma takes the H two molecule</span> <span m='2208000'>and tears it apart and
  makes hydrogen atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='2212000'>And he knew it was neutral.
  And so he reasoned that what</span> <span m='2216000'>must be happening is that
  something has to be coming off</span> <span m='2221000'>of this hydrogen atom to
  make it a positively charged particle.</span> </p><p><span m='2228000'>He said,
  okay, this is going to be H plus.</span> </p><p><span m='2231000'>But then, because
  this was</span> <span m='2234000'>neutral to begin with, whatever came off of the</span>
  <span m='2238000'>hydrogen has to be that negatively charged particle so</span>
  <span m='2242000'>that when they come together they are neutral,</span> <span m='2246000'>because
  a hydrogen atom is neutral.</span> </p><p><span m='2250000'>And, of course, ultimately
  that negatively</span> <span m='2253000'>charged particle was called an electron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2257000'>But the key point is that he said, well, it must be then,</span>
  <span m='2261000'>when these two particles come together, you are going to have</span>
  <span m='2267000'>a neutral particle. It must be that the absolute</span> <span
  m='2271000'>magnitude of the charge on that negatively charged particle,</span>
  <span m='2276000'>the electron, that has to equal the magnitude</span> <span m='2280000'>of
  the charge on that positively charged particle,</span> <span m='2284000'>this hydrogen
  plus ion. That was the conjecture.</span> </p><p><span m='2290000'>Well, if that
  is the case, if I then take a ratio of delta</span> <span m='2297000'>X minus the
  delta X plus, what I am going to get here is</span> <span m='2304000'>just that
  it will be equal to the mass of the hydrogen ion</span> <span m='2310000'>divided
  by the mass of this negatively charged particle,</span> <span m='2317000'>the electron.
  But the observation here is</span> <span m='2322000'>that this deflection, for the
  negatively charged</span> <span m='2326000'>particle, is much larger than it was
  for the positively charged</span> <span m='2331000'>particle. That must mean,</span>
  <span m='2333000'>if this is an equality, that the mass of this hydrogen</span>
  <span m='2338000'>ion is much, much greater than the mass of this negatively</span>
  <span m='2343000'>charged particle, the electron.</span> </p><p><span m='2347000'>And
  this is the stunning result.</span> </p><p><span m='2349000'>It is stunning because,
  at the time,</span> <span m='2353000'>it was already known that a hydrogen atom
  is the least</span> <span m='2358000'>massive atom. There wasn't evidence for any</span>
  <span m='2362000'>other atom less massive than a hydrogen atom.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2367000'>And so here, in this experiment,</span> <span m='2369000'>what we are
  finding is that there is a particle that is less</span> <span m='2374000'>massive
  than the hydrogen atom. You can chop the hydrogen atom</span> <span m='2379000'>up.
  The atom is not the most basic</span> <span m='2382000'>constituent of matter. There
  is some other particle</span> <span m='2386000'>here, which we are going to call
  an electron, that is less</span> <span m='2390000'>massive than a hydrogen atom.
  That was the first piece of</span> <span m='2395000'>evidence for being able to
  split that hydrogen atom,</span> <span m='2399000'>or that atom up into smaller
  particles.</span> </p><p><span m='2404000'>The first evidence that the atom was
  not the most basic</span> <span m='2408000'>constituent of matter. Now, it took
  another ten years,</span> <span m='2412000'>the Millikan oil-drop experiment, for
  this ratio to</span> <span m='2417000'>actually be measured accurately and for the
  mass of the electron</span> <span m='2422000'>to actually be measured accurately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2426000'>And what we now know is that it takes 1,836 masses of the</span>
  <span m='2430000'>electron to equal the mass of a hydrogen atom.</span> </p>
