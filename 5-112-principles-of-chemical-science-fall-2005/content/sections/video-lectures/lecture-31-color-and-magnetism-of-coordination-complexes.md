  </p><p><span m='15000'>Let's get started. We have a lot more chemistry to</span>
  <span m='18000'>learn today. And, as you are probably</span> <span m='21000'>becoming
  aware, the octahedron plays a very</span> <span m='25000'>important role in the
  coordination chemistry of the</span> <span m='29000'>d-block elements. So we are
  going to begin today</span> <span m='33000'>also with the octahedron. And I just
  want to remind you</span> <span m='37000'>of the approach that we were taking on
  Monday to understand</span> <span m='41000'>how d-orbitals split under the influence
  of the presence of a</span> <span m='45000'>set of ligands. And this splitting I
  am</span> <span m='48000'>referring to is an energy splitting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='51000'>We are talking once again about how we can use energy level</span> <span
  m='55000'>diagrams to understand and interpret the properties of</span> <span m='59000'>molecules.
  And today, in particular,</span> <span m='62000'>we are going to be thinking about
  how we can go from the</span> <span m='67000'>angular properties of the d orbitals
  all the way to some of</span> <span m='71000'>the magnetic and spectroscopic or
  color properties of ions that</span> <span m='76000'>contain these d-block transition
  elements.</span> </p><p><span m='79000'>And so, you will remember last time on Monday,</span>
  <span m='83000'>we looked at placing ligands at positions one through six on the</span>
  <span m='88000'>octahedron in reference to our coordinate system that we had</span>
  <span m='92000'>chosen, x, y, and z here, as specified.</span> </p><p><span m='97000'>And
  what we were doing was, at each of these positions that</span> <span m='101000'>corresponds
  to a ligand atom, evaluating each of the</span> <span m='106000'>d-orbitals for
  the value of theta and phi that is found at</span> <span m='111000'>that ligand
  position. And so, I am going to put up</span> <span m='115000'>part of the table
  that we generated last time.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>And that part will correspond
  to ligand position,</span> <span m='124000'>where we have ligands one, two, three,
  four,</span> <span m='128000'>five, and six. Those six ligand positions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132000'>And two of the d orbitals here, d z squared and d x</span>
  <span m='138000'>squared minus y squared, were found to give</span> <span m='144000'>non-zero
  values at these six ligand positions that correspond</span> <span m='150000'>to
  an octahedral complex. The other three d-orbitals gave</span> <span m='156000'>zero
  at those positions because all six of these ligands lie on</span> <span m='161000'>nodal
  planes of xz, yz, and xy.</span> </p><p><span m='164000'>And what we are doing is
  just writing down,</span> <span m='167000'>in tabular form, the relative magnitude
  of what</span> <span m='171000'>you get if you evaluate the orbital at those ligand</span>
  <span m='175000'>positions. We had one in positions one and</span> <span m='178000'>six,
  which are on the big lobes of d z squared along</span> <span m='183000'>the z-axis.
  And we set that to one because</span> <span m='188000'>that is the largest value
  that we get when we evaluate any of</span> <span m='193000'>the orbitals. And then,
  relative to that,</span> <span m='196000'>these ligands two through five that are
  in the x,y-plane and</span> <span m='200000'>which interact with the torus of the
  d z squared</span> <span m='205000'>orbital in the x,y-plane, have a value of one-quarter
  of</span> <span m='209000'>what it is along the z-axis. And then, d x squared minus
  y</span> <span m='215000'>squared evaluated at positions one and</span> <span m='220000'>six
  gave us a zero. And that is because positions</span> <span m='224000'>one and six
  fall on the z-axis, which is actually an</span> <span m='229000'>intersection of
  two nodal planes for the d x squared minus y</span> <span m='234000'>squared orbital.
  And then, here we have at</span> <span m='238000'>positions two through five, three-quarters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='251000'>And if you are having trouble understanding what these numbers</span>
  <span m='255000'>mean, remember that we started out with a sphere,</span> <span
  m='258000'>so we are interested in seeing essentially, what the</span> <span m='261000'>probability
  is in finding that electron in that particular d</span> <span m='265000'>orbital
  at that point on the surface of the sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='270000'>And so
  what this is saying is that, if you will,</span> <span m='273000'>the radial probability
  of finding an electron in d z</span> <span m='277000'>squared along the torus at
  some distance from the</span> <span m='281000'>center is one-quarter what it is
  along the z-axis at the same</span> <span m='286000'>distance from the center. And
  then, at that same</span> <span m='290000'>distance, if we are in the x,y-plane
  along x or along y,</span> <span m='294000'>because that is where the lobes of d
  x squared minus y squared</span> <span m='299000'>extend, that probability drops
  to</span> <span m='302000'>three-quarters relative to the two big lobes of d z squared</span>
  <span m='307000'>along z. You can think of it as telling</span> <span m='311000'>you
  about the size of the lobes. And, accordingly,</span> <span m='314000'>the way that
  these lobes of the d-orbitals can interact with the</span> <span m='318000'>ligands
  at these positions on the surface of the sphere coming</span> <span m='321000'>right
  out of evaluating the angular parts of the wave</span> <span m='324000'>function.
  And then, there are other</span> <span m='326000'>important coordination geometries
  that we have to</span> <span m='329000'>consider. Because coordination number</span>
  <span m='333000'>six, which corresponds to the octahedron, is relatively</span>
  <span m='337000'>common. But coordination number four is</span> <span m='340000'>also
  quite common. And one of the important</span> <span m='343000'>coordination geometries
  for coordination number four is a</span> <span m='347000'>tetrahedral coordination
  geometry.</span> </p><p><span m='350000'>The tetrahedron is not limited to being
  important in organic</span> <span m='354000'>chemistry. It is also important for</span>
  <span m='357000'>coordination chemistry. And you will recall that when</span> <span
  m='362000'>we look at a tetrahedron we talk about ligands at alternating</span>
  <span m='366000'>corners of a cube. And I will call these ligand</span> <span m='370000'>positions
  seven, eight, nine,</span> <span m='372000'>and ten. And, if we have a tetrahedral</span>
  <span m='375000'>metal complex with four ligands, be they water ligands or</span>
  <span m='380000'>chloride ligands and be the central metal ions,</span> <span m='383000'>something
  like cobalt two or nickel two,</span> <span m='387000'>a tetrahedral array like
  this is produced.</span> </p><p><span m='393000'>And we can go ahead and evaluate
  the d orbital wave</span> <span m='397000'>functions at theta and phi values that
  correspond to these</span> <span m='402000'>positions, seven, eight, nine,</span>
  <span m='405000'>and ten, all at the same distance from the center.</span> </p><p><span
  m='409000'>And then we can generate a similar table,</span> <span m='413000'>where
  we have our ligand position and our set of d</span> <span m='418000'>orbitals. And
  I will start here with</span> <span m='422000'>d(xz), d(yz) and d(xy), and over
  here,</span> <span m='427000'>d z squared and d x squared minus y squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='434000'>And we need our ligands</span> <span m='437000'>positioned
  at seven, eight, nine,</span> <span m='441000'>and ten, which are these alternating
  corners of the cube,</span> <span m='447000'>which is the tetrahedral geometry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='453000'>And what we find, when we go through and evaluate</span>
  <span m='457000'>for those theta and phi values that correspond to these ligand</span>
  <span m='463000'>positions using our polar coordinate system and then</span> <span
  m='468000'>scaling it the same way that we do over here for the octahedron,</span>
  <span m='474000'>is that all of these values come out to be one-third.</span> </p><p><span
  m='480000'>Notice that, in the case of the octahedron,</span> <span m='482000'>we
  are interacting with some of the lobes, like the lobes of d z</span> <span m='487000'>squared,
  the large ones,</span> <span m='489000'>directly along the axis that makes it a
  pure sigma</span> <span m='493000'>interaction, a cylindrically symmetric interaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='496000'>A big lobe of d z squared and a ligand coming</span> <span
  m='500000'>in along the z-axis. But if you think of the</span> <span m='503000'>positions
  of the lobes of the xz, yz, and xy orbitals relative</span> <span m='507000'>to
  these ligand positions, seven, eight,</span> <span m='510000'>nine, and ten, the
  interaction is kind of</span> <span m='513000'>oblique. It is not zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='516000'>We are not on a node, but it is pretty small.</span> </p><p><span m='519000'>The
  overlap is not going to be as good.</span> </p><p><span m='522000'>And it evaluates
  to one-third for all of those positions.</span> </p><p><span m='526000'>What we
  find is that while xz, yz, and xy were all zero over</span> <span m='530000'>here
  for the octahedral case, over here, for the tetrahedral</span> <span m='534000'>case,
  they are all the same again, but they are not at zero.</span> </p><p><span m='540000'>They
  are at one-third. And then, for x squared minus y</span> <span m='543000'>squared,
  remember x squared minus y</span> <span m='547000'>squared has its lobes along x
  and y.</span> </p><p><span m='549000'>What that means is that ligands seven, eight,</span>
  <span m='553000'>nine, and ten actually lie on a nodal surface of the d x squared</span>
  <span m='557000'>minus y squared orbital. And that means that this is</span> <span
  m='561000'>zero, this is zero, this is zero,</span> <span m='563000'>and this is
  zero. And the amazing thing about the</span> <span m='569000'>math of the tetrahedral
  geometry is that these ligands,</span> <span m='574000'>seven, eight, nine, and
  ten also lie on the</span> <span m='579000'>nodal surface of d z squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='583000'>Remember that d z squared looks like this and has our opposite</span>
  <span m='589000'>phase torus in the middle and then has a conical nodal</span> <span
  m='594000'>surface. We actually went ahead and --</span> <span m='600000'>If you
  set the equation for d z squared equal to zero</span> <span m='605000'>and solved
  for it, we found this angle here.</span> </p><p><span m='608000'>We found that angle.
  And you will remember that that</span> <span m='613000'>was the arc cosine of root
  three over three.</span> </p><p><span m='616000'>It turns out that that value is
  exactly half of the tetrahedral</span> <span m='621000'>angle, which is the angel
  between seven,</span> <span m='625000'>the center and eight. And, because of this,</span>
  <span m='629000'>all ligands, seven, eight,</span> <span m='631000'>nine, and ten
  lie on the conical nodal surface of d z</span> <span m='635000'>squared, such that
  we get zeros here,</span> <span m='639000'>too. One thing that relates very</span>
  <span m='641000'>nicely, the orbital picture for the tetrahedral case for the</span>
  <span m='646000'>octahedral case, is that z squared has the same</span> <span m='649000'>energy
  as x squared minus y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='652000'>When you sum over all
  the ligand positions,</span> <span m='655000'>we are going to get three here, and
  we are going to get three</span> <span m='660000'>here. And xz, yz, and xy all have</span>
  <span m='664000'>zero. And over here xz,</span> <span m='666000'>yz, and xy all
  have four-thirds.</span> </p><p><span m='669000'>And z squared and x squared minus
  y squared</span> <span m='674000'>both have zero. And so I will redraw that over</span>
  <span m='678000'>here.</span> </p><p><span m='688000'>What we are doing is drawing
  up d orbital splitting diagrams for</span> <span m='693000'>two different possible
  coordination geometries for a</span> <span m='697000'>coordination complex. Let
  me just make that very</span> <span m='701000'>clear.</span> </p><p><span m='725000'>And
  I have my energy units here, zero, one,</span> <span m='728000'>two, three. And
  this energy level diagram</span> <span m='731000'>looks like this for the octahedral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='734000'>And we symbolize the octahedral geometry with this Oh for</span>
  <span m='738000'>octahedral. And we have here an energy</span> <span m='741000'>splitting.
  We have a triply degenerate set</span> <span m='747000'>of orbitals which we recognize
  as xz, yz, and xy.</span> </p><p><span m='755000'>And the name that we give to that
  triply degenerate set is</span> <span m='764000'>t(2g). This t(2g) triply degenerate</span>
  <span m='770000'>set, for this whole set, is the t(2g) set.</span> </p><p><span
  m='778000'>If I use that label t(2g), you should remember the</span> <span m='781000'>specific
  d orbitals that contribute to the t(2g) set and</span> <span m='784000'>make up
  the t2g set. Up here we have the d z squared</span> <span m='788000'>and the d x
  squared minus y squared</span> <span m='792000'>at the same energy, which are three
  relative energy</span> <span m='795000'>units here. And those two together</span>
  <span m='797000'>constitute the e(g) set. And I will often write that</span> <span
  m='800000'>with a star because we are going to find out later,</span> <span m='803000'>when
  we do the molecular orbital theory of coordination</span> <span m='807000'>complexes,
  that these are antibonding.</span> </p><p><span m='811000'>And the reason they are
  antibonding is because,</span> <span m='814000'>if you go over here and look at
  it, if you have a ligand that</span> <span m='818000'>wants to act as a Lewis base
  with respect to d z squared,</span> <span m='822000'>then putting an electron in
  d z squared</span> <span m='825000'>leads to repulsion of that ligand, generating</span>
  <span m='829000'>antibonding characters. You want your Lewis acid to</span> <span
  m='833000'>have empty orbitals to receive lone pairs of electrons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='838000'>And, if instead they are populated, that corresponds to</span> <span
  m='841000'>antibonding character, much like we have talked about</span> <span m='845000'>for
  other types of molecular orbital diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='848000'>This d-orbital
  splitting diagram for Oh is really a</span> <span m='852000'>simplified molecular
  orbital diagram for the molecule in</span> <span m='856000'>which we just look at
  those orbitals that derive from the</span> <span m='860000'>set of five d orbitals
  on that metal ion.</span> </p><p><span m='863000'>Because these are the orbitals,
  --</span> <span m='867000'>-- and, together with the electrons that occupy them,</span>
  <span m='871000'>they control the properties of color and magnetism that we will</span>
  <span m='876000'>be talking about for the rest of today.</span> </p><p><span m='880000'>And
  let me remind you here that we have a name for the magnitude</span> <span m='885000'>of
  this splitting, which is called delta O for</span> <span m='889000'>octahedral.
  And then, we also have the</span> <span m='892000'>tetrahedral case. And how do
  we get the diagram</span> <span m='896000'>from this? We just sum over the</span>
  <span m='900000'>contributions from each of the ligand positions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='904000'>In tetrahedral, there are only four ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='908000'>For
  xz, yz, and zy we have to sum up four times one-third,</span> <span m='913000'>and
  that gives us, for that set of three orbitals</span> <span m='917000'>using the
  same energy scale as over there, three orbitals at a</span> <span m='922000'>value
  of four-thirds and two orbitals down here at our zero</span> <span m='927000'>of
  energy. And these will be d z squared,</span> <span m='932000'>located on that node,
  and x squared minus y</span> <span m='938000'>squared. Whereas, up here we have
  xz,</span> <span m='944000'>yz, and zy. And these get the names e and</span> <span
  m='948000'>t(2) in the tetrahedral geometry.</span> </p><p><span m='952000'>And
  the splitting between the levels, the doubly degenerate</span> <span m='958000'>and
  the triply degenerate pair of energy levels,</span> <span m='964000'>is here referred
  to as delta t. And from the math of these two</span> <span m='971000'>tables and
  the magnitude of this splitting being three relative</span> <span m='978000'>to
  this one being four-thirds, you can easily derive the</span> <span m='983000'>relation
  that delta t is equal to four-ninths of delta O.</span> </p><p><span m='989000'>One
  of the neat things about</span> <span m='995000'>this result qualitatively is that
  if you have more ligands,</span> <span m='1000000'>six versus four, you have a larger
  splitting of</span> <span m='1005000'>the energy levels. And that corresponds to
  putting</span> <span m='1009000'>more Lewis bases, more negative charges,</span>
  <span m='1013000'>around that sphere that we talked about,</span> <span m='1016000'>in
  the coordination sphere. And also, if you have</span> <span m='1022000'>interactions
  between ligands and metal d orbitals that are end-on</span> <span m='1028000'>sigma
  symmetry, directed at each other,</span> <span m='1032000'>you get bigger splitting
  because that leads to better</span> <span m='1037000'>overlap than the type of oblique
  overlap that you get if you have</span> <span m='1043000'>a ligand at a position
  such as seven relative to an orbital</span> <span m='1049000'>like d(xz). You can
  now see that to fully</span> <span m='1053000'>appreciate this, you really have
  to have a very</span> <span m='1057000'>good grasp of the nodal properties of the
  d orbitals.</span> </p><p><span m='1060000'>This is why I am going to re-emphasize
  that you should</span> <span m='1064000'>spend some time on the computer visualizing
  these things and</span> <span m='1068000'>rotating them around and seeing where
  these ligand positions for</span> <span m='1072000'>these different coordination
  geometries are with respect to</span> <span m='1076000'>each of the five d orbitals.
  That is quite important.</span> </p><p><span m='1080000'>Also, you are going to
  see that you could consider other</span> <span m='1084000'>possible coordination
  geometries that involve ligands at these</span> <span m='1088000'>positions or at
  other positions. For coordination number five,</span> <span m='1092000'>you could
  have a trigonal bipyramid coordination geometry.</span> </p><p><span m='1096000'>And
  you could go ahead and evaluate the d orbitals at the</span> <span m='1100000'>relevant
  positions. You would already have three of</span> <span m='1103000'>them here because
  in a trigonal bipyramid, you would have</span> <span m='1107000'>ligands at positions
  one and six, and two.</span> </p><p><span m='1111000'>And then two more back here
  at 120 degrees to two,</span> <span m='1114000'>but in the x,y-plane. So you can
  do a trigonal</span> <span m='1117000'>bipyramid the same way and generate the d-orbital
  splitting</span> <span m='1120000'>diagram for it. You can also go ahead and do
  a</span> <span m='1123000'>d-orbital splitting diagram for a different geometry</span>
  <span m='1127000'>corresponding to coordination number four, which would be the</span>
  <span m='1130000'>square planar coordination geometry.</span> </p><p><span m='1133000'>If
  you just took ligand positions two,</span> <span m='1135000'>three, four, and five
  you could generate a</span> <span m='1138000'>diagram. And that diagram would be</span>
  <span m='1141000'>relevant for systems that do have square planar coordination</span>
  <span m='1145000'>around a metal center, and these are actually fairly</span> <span
  m='1149000'>common. Those are the four coordination</span> <span m='1152000'>geometries,
  octahedral, tetrahedral,</span> <span m='1154000'>trigonal bipyramid, and square
  planar that are all</span> <span m='1157000'>pretty commonly encountered and that
  you can actually interpret</span> <span m='1162000'>pretty nicely using the d-orbital
  splitting diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='1165000'>Now, one of the properties that
  we are going to want to</span> <span m='1169000'>interpret will be the magnetism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1190000'>And, in talking about the magnetism of coordination</span>
  <span m='1194000'>complexes, we are going to start by mentioning two terms that
  you</span> <span m='1200000'>have probably heard, but I would like to define</span>
  <span m='1204000'>explicitly today. One is paramagnetic.</span> </p><p><span m='1208000'>That
  term is given to substances that are attracted</span> <span m='1213000'>into a magnetic
  field. It is somehow a bulk phenomenon</span> <span m='1217000'>that we are going
  to relate to properties of d orbital</span> <span m='1222000'>splitting diagrams.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1235000'>And systems can also be described as diamagnetic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1238000'>And there are many other types of magnetic behavior that
  we</span> <span m='1242000'>won't be discussing. I'm a little too close to the</span>
  <span m='1250000'>board, here. Diamagnetic.</span> </p><p><span m='1256000'>And
  that means that the substance is repelled out of or</span> <span m='1262000'>away
  from a magnetic field. And one thing that you should</span> <span m='1270000'>keep
  in mind is that the magnitude of paramagnetism is</span> <span m='1276000'>usually
  orders of magnitude greater than the magnitude of</span> <span m='1284000'>diamagnetism.
  So, this is much larger.</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>And what this means is
  if a substance behaves as a</span> <span m='1297000'>paramagnet, you can often neglect
  its diamagnetism that</span> <span m='1301000'>also may be present, also must be
  present.</span> </p><p><span m='1303000'>The substances that are paramagnetic are
  also</span> <span m='1306000'>diamagnetic, but the paramagnetism is much larger
  in</span> <span m='1310000'>terms of its order of magnitude and wins out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1313000'>If you want to measure one of these quantities for a system,</span>
  <span m='1317000'>that which is far more difficult to measure is the</span> <span
  m='1320000'>diamagnetism because it is a much smaller number.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1325000'>And then, I want to bring up this quantity S.</span> </p><p><span m='1331000'>This
  is the spin quantum number.</span> </p><p><span m='1348000'>And you can readily
  calculate S from looking at a populated d</span> <span m='1355000'>orbital spitting
  diagram because it will be the total number of</span> <span m='1363000'>electrons
  multiplied by one-half, which is the spin per</span> <span m='1370000'>electron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1380000'>If you are confronted with a particular coordination complex,</span>
  <span m='1383000'>the kind of thought process you will need to go through is,</span>
  <span m='1387000'>what is the coordination number, what is the coordination</span>
  <span m='1391000'>geometry, what does the d orbital splitting diagram look</span>
  <span m='1394000'>like, how many electrons do I have with which to populate the</span>
  <span m='1398000'>d orbital splitting diagram? After I have figured out how to</span>
  <span m='1402000'>populate the d orbital splitting diagram, how many of those</span>
  <span m='1406000'>electrons are unpaired? That gives me this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1410000'>I can then calculate S. And, if I have S,</span> <span m='1413000'>I
  can make a prediction about the value of something called</span> <span m='1418000'>the
  spin-only magnetic moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1429000'>Let me mention one more
  thing back here, and that would be the</span> <span m='1434000'>units.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1441000'>When we talk about magnetism, we are going to be using units.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1448000'>This is called the Bohr magneton.</span> </p><p><span m='1452000'>It
  is sometimes written as mu sub b.</span> </p><p><span m='1458000'>It is also sometimes
  written as capital B., capital M.</span> </p><p><span m='1464000'>That is the Bohr
  magneton.</span> </p><p><span m='1470000'>And it is equal to 9.2741x10^-24 joules
  per tesla.</span> </p><p><span m='1479000'>This is the value of the Bohr magneton.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1487000'>And the Bohr magneton is the unit, also, of our magnetic</span>
  <span m='1498000'>moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1510000'>And in particular, today,
  I am going to be talking</span> <span m='1514000'>about the spin-only value of the
  magnetic moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1518000'>So we are going to be making predictions
  using spin-only</span> <span m='1522000'>considerations. And for those considerations,</span>
  <span m='1526000'>we need to be able to calculate S.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>And
  we can do that pretty quickly after we have it</span> <span m='1534000'>correctly
  populated, correctly chosen d orbital</span> <span m='1538000'>splitting diagram
  for the system.</span> </p><p><span m='1541000'>And so the spin-only value for the
  magnetic moment is given by</span> <span m='1546000'>this formula, which is mu is
  equal to 2.00</span> <span m='1550000'>times the square root of S times S plus one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1554000'>And, in this formula,</span> <span m='1560000'>this part,
  this square root of S times S plus one,</span> <span m='1566000'>from the quantum
  mechanics, is the value of the angular</span> <span m='1573000'>momentum, the electron
  spin angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='1590000'>And this value 2.00, I am
  calling it 2.00.</span> </p><p><span m='1594000'>It is actually a number that differs
  only very slightly from</span> <span m='1600000'>two. So we can, for most purposes,</span>
  <span m='1604000'>use 2.00. This is called the gyromagnetic</span> <span m='1608000'>ratio
  of the electron.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>And, as its name implies, it is
  the ratio of the angular</span> <span m='1624000'>momentum to the magnetic moment
  for the electron.</span> </p><p><span m='1629000'>This is our conversion factor
  to go back and forth between</span> <span m='1634000'>angular momentum and magnetic
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1637000'>And that factor is the gyromagnetic ratio
  for the</span> <span m='1641000'>electron. You will see this as gamma,</span> <span
  m='1644000'>sometimes. And, for the free electron</span> <span m='1648000'>value,
  it is a number very close to two.</span> </p><p><span m='1653000'>And so, if you
  think about different ions that could be at</span> <span m='1657000'>the center
  of a coordination complex, you wonder,</span> <span m='1661000'>well, what are my
  possible values for the spin-only</span> <span m='1666000'>magnetic moment, as given
  by this formula?</span> </p><p><span m='1669000'>Well, we can make a table for that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1672000'>We have the number of electrons that are unpaired,</span>
  <span m='1676000'>remember. And then, we will be able to</span> <span m='1679000'>calculate
  S. And then we will want to get</span> <span m='1684000'>mu, which is this spin-only
  value calculated according to</span> <span m='1690000'>that formula. And ions from
  the part of the</span> <span m='1695000'>Periodic Table that we may consider working
  with can have</span> <span m='1701000'>one, two, three, four, five, six,</span>
  <span m='1704000'>up to seven unpaired electrons. These numbers,</span> <span m='1710000'>like
  six and seven, are more important for the</span> <span m='1713000'>lanthanide ions
  in systems with f-electrons than for systems</span> <span m='1718000'>with d electrons.
  But, nonetheless,</span> <span m='1720000'>we can easily make these predictions
  the same way.</span> </p><p><span m='1724000'>And so S would be one-half for one
  electron,</span> <span m='1728000'>one, then three-halves, then two for four unpaired</span>
  <span m='1731000'>electrons, then five-halves for five unpaired electrons,</span>
  <span m='1736000'>then three, and then seven-halves finally for seven</span> <span
  m='1740000'>unpaired electrons. And if you put this into this</span> <span m='1746000'>formula,
  you would see that for one unpaired electron,</span> <span m='1753000'>it would
  be one-half times one-half plus one square root</span> <span m='1760000'>times two.
  That would be square root of</span> <span m='1765000'>three, so this would be a
  spin-only magnetic moment of</span> <span m='1775000'>we actually have a value of
  about 2.83.</span> </p><p><span m='1782000'>And then for three unpaired electrons,
  we have a value of,</span> <span m='1788000'>let's say approximately 3.87. And then
  for S equals two,</span> <span m='1795000'>or four unpaired electrons, we have a
  value of 4.90.</span> </p><p><span m='1802000'>For the spin-only magnetic moment,
  if you go through with</span> <span m='1806000'>these values of S, these numbers
  of unpaired</span> <span m='1809000'>electrons. Let's just make sure we are</span>
  <span m='1812000'>very clear on that.</span> </p><p><span m='1820000'>And then 5.92,
  6.93, 7.94 approximately.</span> </p><p><span m='1826000'>You can check those numbers,
  but they are approximately</span> <span m='1834000'>right. And in each case what
  you are</span> <span m='1838000'>seeing is the spin-only prediction for the magnetic</span>
  <span m='1842000'>moment is always, in units of Bohr magnetons,</span> <span m='1846000'>a
  little less than one plus the number of unpaired electrons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1851000'>It is not like you have four unpaired electrons,</span> <span m='1855000'>so
  your spin-only magnetic moment is around four.</span> </p><p><span m='1860000'>It
  is actually a little less than five.</span> </p><p><span m='1863000'>And that is
  because of the quantum mechanics of the</span> <span m='1868000'>electron spin angular
  momentum. And this kind of consideration,</span> <span m='1875000'>here, leads you
  into thinking about what happens with</span> <span m='1880000'>different d^n counts
  for a particular type of metal</span> <span m='1885000'>complex.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1892000'>This means that we are going to attack and address the high</span> <span
  m='1900000'>spin/low spin problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1916000'>These systems
  are not so terribly difficult,</span> <span m='1919000'>but let's face it; --</span>
  <span m='1921000'>-- once you have been presented with a particular coordination</span>
  <span m='1924000'>complex, and you think you know the geometry,</span> <span m='1927000'>and
  you think you know the d orbital splitting diagram that</span> <span m='1931000'>corresponds
  to that geometry, and you think you know how many</span> <span m='1935000'>d electrons
  go into that diagram, there is one more</span> <span m='1938000'>thing. And that
  is sometimes you have</span> <span m='1940000'>to figure out if it is high spin
  or if it is low spin.</span> </p><p><span m='1945000'>And what that means is for
  a particular d^n count,</span> <span m='1949000'>there might be two possible choices
  over here,</span> <span m='1953000'>depending on how the electrons occupy the orbitals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1958000'>And so let's look at an example of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1961000'>Here is energy. Again, we are really focusing a</span> <span m='1966000'>lot
  on energy level diagrams. Sometimes we focus on molecular</span> <span m='1971000'>orbital
  diagrams. Right now, we are using these d</span> <span m='1976000'>orbital splitting
  diagrams. And I will give you an example</span> <span m='1983000'>that is octahedral.
  And this is a species that we</span> <span m='1987000'>looked at in a recent demonstration
  in class,</span> <span m='1992000'>which is hexaaquo meaning six waters around an
  iron two plus</span> <span m='1998000'>in an octahedral array.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2001000'>This will be our metal complex for which we will draw the d</span> <span
  m='2007000'>orbital splitting diagram. It is an octahedral complex,</span> <span
  m='2013000'>so we draw our diagram like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2017000'>And
  of course, we have t(2g) and e(g)* levels</span> <span m='2022000'>that we can populate
  with our d electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2026000'>And we are going to need to
  figure out how many d electrons</span> <span m='2032000'>we have to put into this
  diagram for the octahedral system.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>The oxidation
  state of the iron here is +2.</span> </p><p><span m='2044000'>And you can tell that
  because the way you tell oxidation state</span> <span m='2050000'>is to take into
  account both the charge on the ligands.</span> </p><p><span m='2056000'>Chlorides,
  for example, are minus one.</span> </p><p><span m='2060000'>Because water is a neutral
  molecule, it is simply neutral.</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>And then, you have
  to also take into account the charge on the</span> <span m='2072000'>whole ion.
  So this is iron two plus.</span> </p><p><span m='2076000'>The iron in the plus two</span>
  <span m='2078000'>oxidation state with six neutral ligands.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2080000'>If I had six NH three ligands in the same charge on</span> <span m='2083000'>the
  ion, then it would still be iron plus two.</span> </p><p><span m='2086000'>And you
  are going to get some practice figuring out oxidation</span> <span m='2090000'>state
  because if you cannot do that correctly you cannot</span> <span m='2093000'>identify
  the number of d electrons to put into the</span> <span m='2096000'>diagram correctly.
  And this is iron plus two.</span> </p><p><span m='2098000'>You need to know that
  iron is</span> <span m='2102000'>in Group 8 of the periodic table.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2105000'>The equation for number of d electrons here is eight minus</span> <span
  m='2111000'>two equals six. If it is in Group 8,</span> <span m='2115000'>that means
  that an iron atom has eight valance electrons,</span> <span m='2120000'>the same
  way that carbon has four valance electrons or oxygen</span> <span m='2126000'>has
  six valance electrons. And in Group 8 of the periodic</span> <span m='2132000'>table,
  we are subtracting two from the eight valance electrons</span> <span m='2136000'>because
  there is a two plus charge on the system.</span> </p><p><span m='2140000'>That leaves
  six valance electrons on the iron.</span> </p><p><span m='2143000'>And that means
  this is what we call a d six system.</span> </p><p><span m='2148000'>By convention,
  we are considering all the</span> <span m='2151000'>valance electrons that remain
  after the metal has been</span> <span m='2155000'>oxidized to plus two as d electrons,
  meaning they are</span> <span m='2159000'>going to go into our d orbital splitting
  diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='2164000'>Now, the reason we do this, in fact, is
  because in ions</span> <span m='2168000'>like this, the d orbitals are the orbitals
  on the metal,</span> <span m='2173000'>on the iron, that are the lowest in energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2177000'>After, in the case of iron, iron has principle quantum</span>
  <span m='2182000'>number three. There is also a 4s and a 4p set</span> <span m='2186000'>of
  orbitals available to iron, but they are much higher in</span> <span m='2191000'>energy.
  We are simplifying the system</span> <span m='2195000'>and just looking at what
  happens with the five d orbitals,</span> <span m='2200000'>which are the lowest
  valance energy orbitals available to the</span> <span m='2205000'>iron. Just like
  a carbon has a 2s and</span> <span m='2208000'>a set of three 2p orbitals, an iron
  has a set of five 3d</span> <span m='2213000'>orbitals, a 4s, and three 4p orbitals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2216000'>But those s and p ones are higher.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2220000'>We are just focusing on our d orbitals, here,</span> <span m='2224000'>using
  our d orbital only splitting diagrams with which we</span> <span m='2230000'>have
  six electrons for population of a diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='2234000'>And so
  what you see immediately is you will identify with the</span> <span m='2240000'>notion
  that there are two ways to populate this diagram with</span> <span m='2246000'>six
  electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2252000'>Because we can do this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2257000'>Here, we are following Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity,</span> <span
  m='2262000'>trying not to pair up any electrons until we run out of</span> <span
  m='2267000'>spots for them, and so we have to.</span> </p><p><span m='2270000'>There
  is one way to populate the diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='2274000'>Two electrons
  in e(g)*. Four electrons in t(2g).</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>One of them,
  spin inverted relative to the</span> <span m='2284000'>other five because you cannot
  put two electrons in the same</span> <span m='2290000'>orbital unless they have
  different spins.</span> </p><p><span m='2294000'>And, finally, we could populate
  the diagram</span> <span m='2298000'>this way. The case on the left is what we</span>
  <span m='2302000'>call high spin.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>The case on the
  right is what we call low spin.</span> </p><p><span m='2320000'>And, as you think
  about it, you will realize that the high</span> <span m='2324000'>spin/low spin
  problem only arises for certain d^n counts.</span> </p><p><span m='2329000'>It doesn't
  arise, for example,</span> <span m='2331000'>for d one because we would just put
  one electron down</span> <span m='2336000'>here in t(2g) and that is not a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2340000'>And you will see that, as you run through the d one</span>
  <span m='2344000'>all the way up to the d ten.</span> </p><p><span m='2347000'>d^n
  counts can go from d^0 to d^10, and that is the limit of</span> <span m='2352000'>the
  possibilities here. Zero, one, two,</span> <span m='2355000'>three, four, five,
  six, seven,</span> <span m='2357000'>eight, nine, and ten.</span> </p><p><span m='2359000'>Here
  I have chosen a d^6 case to illustrate the high spin</span> <span m='2363000'>versus
  low spin dichotomy. And you might wonder when do</span> <span m='2368000'>you --
  Well, let me get back to that</span> <span m='2372000'>in a moment. And let me just
  say here that</span> <span m='2376000'>we have four unpaired electrons in d^6 high
  spin.</span> </p><p><span m='2380000'>We have one, two, three, four.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2383000'>That makes this an s equals two case.</span> </p><p><span m='2386000'>And,
  over here, we have s equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2390000'>And so this one
  on the right, this low spin case is s equals</span> <span m='2395000'>zero. We would
  say that this is not</span> <span m='2398000'>paramagnetic. It is going to be only</span>
  <span m='2403000'>diamagnetic. It has no unpaired electrons to</span> <span m='2407000'>give
  it a magnetic moment according to the spin-only</span> <span m='2412000'>formula
  that we looked at over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2415000'>On the other hand,
  over here, we have an s equals</span> <span m='2420000'>two state that predicts
  a magnetic moment of 4.90 Bohr</span> <span m='2425000'>magnetons. And experimentally,</span>
  <span m='2428000'>mu was found for this system to be 5.1 Bohr magnetons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2435000'>So we say this one turned out to be high spin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2440000'>And in a little while, we will be talking more about</span> <span m='2445000'>what
  are the physical factors that determine whether a system</span> <span m='2452000'>is
  low spin or high spin. Remember, we have this delta O</span> <span m='2458000'>here.
  And there is not one value for</span> <span m='2462000'>delta O, and this is something
  I am going to emphasize again in a</span> <span m='2467000'>moment. Delta O varies
  according to a</span> <span m='2470000'>number of factors, and these factors include
  the</span> <span m='2474000'>specific nature of the ligands. It includes the charge
  on the</span> <span m='2479000'>metal center. It includes the specific metal</span>
  <span m='2482000'>that you are using. And at some point,</span> <span m='2485000'>if
  delta O gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and</span> <span m='2490000'>exceeds
  what we call the pairing energy --</span> <span m='2507000'>This pairing energy
  is something I will talk more about</span> <span m='2510000'>later, but it is the
  energy required to put two electrons in</span> <span m='2513000'>the same d orbital.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2530000'>If you get to a condition where delta O is greater than
  this</span> <span m='2535000'>pairing energy, in other words,</span> <span m='2540000'>there
  is a big splitting between t(2g) and e(g)*,</span> <span m='2545000'>then the electrons
  will prefer to pair up down here in the</span> <span m='2551000'>t(2g). Whereas,
  if you think of it</span> <span m='2555000'>going to the limit of an infinitely
  small delta O,</span> <span m='2559000'>they would have S equals two because the
  gap between t(2g)</span> <span m='2564000'>and e(g)* in the limit of vanishing delta
  O,</span> <span m='2567000'>for example, when ligands go to an infinite</span> <span
  m='2571000'>distance away from the metal center, they would then,</span> <span m='2575000'>in
  that limit, have all five the same energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>And so
  your S would naturally equal two.</span> </p><p><span m='2583000'>If delta O is
  much greater than the pairing energy giving a</span> <span m='2589000'>large value
  of delta O, then that favors low spin.</span> </p><p><span m='2594000'>Factors that
  give rise to large values of delta O favor low</span> <span m='2600000'>spin, and
  I will talk about a few more factors like that in a</span> <span m='2606000'>moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2616000'>Here is a brief introduction to the magnetic properties
  of</span> <span m='2620000'>coordination complexes. And I want to show that we can</span>
  <span m='2625000'>use the same types of diagrams to talk about the colors of</span>
  <span m='2629000'>transition metal complexes. We looked at the color change</span>
  <span m='2634000'>in that demonstration I showed you.</span> </p><p><span m='2638000'>And
  one of the really fascinating aspects of</span> <span m='2642000'>transition metal
  chemistry is the colors that arise because of</span> <span m='2648000'>absorption
  of a photon coincident with promotion of an</span> <span m='2653000'>electron from
  t(2g) to e(g)*. And so we will talk briefly now</span> <span m='2659000'>about electronic
  / absorption spectroscopy.</span> </p><p><span m='2680000'>And the most important
  thing I want to impart to you here is a</span> <span m='2688000'>selection rule
  wherein delta S is equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2698000'>This is the spin
  selection rule.</span> </p><p><span m='2710000'>And this means that when a photon
  comes in and interacts</span> <span m='2714000'>with d electrons in a system of
  the type we are discussing,</span> <span m='2719000'>that photon can be absorbed
  coincident with promotion of an</span> <span m='2724000'>electron from t(2g) to
  e(g)*, as long as it doesn't violate</span> <span m='2729000'>this spin selection
  rule. And that means that the number</span> <span m='2734000'>of unpaired electrons
  should be the same in the system before</span> <span m='2739000'>the photon is taken
  up, as it is after.</span> </p><p><span m='2743000'>And so here is an example of
  that, a simple example.</span> </p><p><span m='2747000'>Here is an octahedral system,
  titanium with six waters and a</span> <span m='2752000'>three plus charge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2756000'>Titanium is in Group 4 of the periodic table.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2761000'>Our water ligands are neutral, with three plus charges to be</span>
  <span m='2765000'>subtracted from four. We have a d^1 system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2767000'>This is one of the simplest cases for talking about</span> <span m='2771000'>electronic
  absorption spectroscopy and is the first</span> <span m='2774000'>thing that you
  encounter in your textbook.</span> </p><p><span m='2777000'>By the way, let me just
  remind you that right now you should be</span> <span m='2781000'>reading Chapter
  16 in your textbook, that deals with</span> <span m='2785000'>coordination chemistry,
  electronic structure of d-block</span> <span m='2788000'>elements, colors and magnetism,
  and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2793000'>And the ground state, here, is one
  in which t(2g) has</span> <span m='2798000'>a single electron in it for this d^1
  ion and e(g)* is vacant.</span> </p><p><span m='2805000'>And, if that system, in
  the case of titanium three</span> <span m='2810000'>aquo in aqueous solution, is
  a pale blue color,</span> <span m='2815000'>a pretty pale blue -- If a photon comes
  in of the</span> <span m='2821000'>appropriate energy delta O to promote the electron
  into e(g)*,</span> <span m='2827000'>then that transforms this system into an excited
  state,</span> <span m='2832000'>as follows, with a configuration (t two g) zero
  and</span> <span m='2836000'>(e g star) one.</span> </p><p><span m='2839000'>These
  diagrams, just like the molecular orbital</span> <span m='2844000'>diagrams we developed
  for diatomic molecules,</span> <span m='2848000'>can be associated with configurations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2853000'>And this transition can be written as( t two g) one (e
  g</span> <span m='2858000'>star) zero, photon in, electron promoted</span> <span
  m='2864000'>into e g star, t two g zero and e g star one</span> <span m='2870000'>now
  corresponding to the excited</span> <span m='2875000'>state. And this excited state
  is</span> <span m='2878000'>produced in a vibrationally excited manner.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2884000'>And it and the ground state interact with the environment in</span>
  <span m='2888000'>different ways, such that the absorption</span> <span m='2891000'>spectrum
  for a system of this type gives rise to not a sharp,</span> <span m='2895000'>but
  a broad peak. And, in fact,</span> <span m='2898000'>the spectrum would look something
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2901000'>Going from 200 to nanometers in wavelength,</span>
  <span m='2904000'>you would see a profile like this with one broad peak</span> <span
  m='2908000'>somewhere in the red, such that we would be behind</span> <span m='2912000'>the
  pale blue color of these solutions of aqueous titanium</span> <span m='2916000'>three.
  So this would be an absorption</span> <span m='2922000'>spectrum, and this is wavelength,
  down here.</span> </p><p><span m='2925000'>And this is the peak for what we call
  this d-d transition,</span> <span m='2929000'>from t(2g) to e(g)*. There are a lot
  more subtleties</span> <span m='2933000'>on this, which is where I will begin on
  Monday.</span> </p><p><span m='2937325'>Have a great weekend.</span> </p>
