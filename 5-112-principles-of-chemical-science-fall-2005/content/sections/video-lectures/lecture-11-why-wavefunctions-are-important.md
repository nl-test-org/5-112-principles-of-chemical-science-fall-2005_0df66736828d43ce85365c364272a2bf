  </p><p><span m='15000'>I just wanted to briefly remind you of some of the periodic</span>
  <span m='21000'>trends that we talked about. As you go across the periodic</span>
  <span m='27000'>table, both the electron affinity and the ionization</span> <span
  m='32000'>energy increase. They increase because the</span> <span m='37000'>nuclear
  charge increases. Remember, the potential energy</span> <span m='44000'>of interaction
  is Z times e, where that is the nuclear</span> <span m='50000'>charges, times e
  over 4 pi epsilon nought r.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>Z increases as you go
  across the periodic table here.</span> </p><p><span m='64000'>As you go across,
  r is remaining the same because</span> <span m='67000'>you are essentially still
  in the same shell.</span> </p><p><span m='71000'>And so what increases is that attractive
  interaction,</span> <span m='75000'>meaning the electrons are more strongly bound,</span>
  <span m='78000'>meaning ionization energy and electron affinity increases as</span>
  <span m='83000'>you go across. And this also means,</span> <span m='85000'>as you
  go across, r, the radius decreases.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>The radius decreases
  again because Z increases.</span> </p><p><span m='94000'>The nucleus is pulling
  the electrons in closer.</span> </p><p><span m='98000'>Since they are all in the
  same shell, r is remaining the same.</span> </p><p><span m='104000'>And so, the
  overall effect is that the radius of the atoms</span> <span m='109000'>decreases.
  As you go down the Periodic</span> <span m='113000'>Table, the ionization energy
  and the electron affinity decrease.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>They decrease
  because it is the r dependence,</span> <span m='124000'>here, that takes over. Z
  is, of course,</span> <span m='127000'>increasing, but not as fast as r.</span>
  </p><p><span m='130000'>As you go down the Periodic Table, you are going to shells</span>
  <span m='136000'>that, on the average, are further out from the</span> <span m='140000'>nucleus.
  And that dependence takes over,</span> <span m='144000'>causing EA and IE to decrease.
  And then the radius,</span> <span m='150000'>of course, increases, because, as you
  go down,</span> <span m='154000'>you are putting the electrons into shells which
  are on the</span> <span m='161000'>average farther away from the nucleus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='164000'>That is just a review of those trends.</span> </p><p><span
  m='168000'>Then, finally, I want to just define another</span> <span m='173000'>term,
  and that is the electronegativity.</span> </p><p><span m='179000'>Sometimes we give
  that the symbol chi.</span> </p><p><span m='181000'>The electronegativity is an
  empirical quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='185000'>We are going to use Mulliken's
  definition for the</span> <span m='189000'>electronegativity. There is a Pauling
  definition.</span> </p><p><span m='193000'>Mulliken is a little bit more straightforward.</span>
  </p><p><span m='197000'>And that electronegativity is defined as one-half times
  the</span> <span m='201000'>quantity ionization energy plus the electron affinity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='206000'>The electronegativity is</span> <span m='211000'>proportional
  to the average of the ionization energy and the</span> <span m='217000'>electron
  affinity. The electronegativity is a</span> <span m='222000'>measure of the tendency
  of an atom to accept or to donate an</span> <span m='228000'>electron. If you look
  at the Periodic</span> <span m='231000'>Table, here, you have atoms in the upper
  right-hand corner of</span> <span m='234000'>This wave function is passing</span>
  <span m='235000'>Here is the wave function.</span> <span m='237000'>the Periodic
  Table. Well, they have high</span> <span m='242000'>electronegativities. They are
  good electron</span> <span m='247000'>acceptors. They have high</span> <span m='249000'>electronegativities
  because they have high electron affinities.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>Adding
  an electron to them means that there is a larger</span> <span m='260000'>amount
  of energy release. The anion is much more stable</span> <span m='266000'>than the
  neutral. And the electron affinity is</span> <span m='270000'>minus that energy
  change, remember from last time.</span> </p><p><span m='274000'>These atoms here,
  with their high electron</span> <span m='277000'>affinities, are good electron acceptors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='279000'>They are also good electron acceptors because their</span>
  <span m='283000'>ionization energies are also high, which means you have to</span>
  <span m='287000'>put in a lot of energy to pull an electron off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='290000'>They don't like to donate electrons, rather they are good</span> <span
  m='294000'>electron acceptors. And then, the elements that are</span> <span m='300000'>in
  the bottom left-hand corner of the Periodic Table have low</span> <span m='306000'>electronegativities.
  They are good electron donors</span> <span m='311000'>because their ionization energy
  is low in this part of the</span> <span m='317000'>periodic table. You don't have
  to put in so</span> <span m='322000'>much energy to pull an electron off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='326000'>They are also good electron donors because their electron</span>
  <span m='331000'>affinity is low. You don't get as much energy</span> <span m='337000'>back
  when you put an electron on them.</span> </p><p><span m='340000'>These are good
  electron donors. High chi, here.</span> </p><p><span m='344000'>These are good electron
  acceptors.</span> </p><p><span m='346000'>And one thing you already know probably
  is that some of the</span> <span m='351000'>strongest ionic bonds are made between
  elements in these two</span> <span m='356000'>corners of the periodic table. An
  ionic bond,</span> <span m='361000'>as we are going to talk about, is one in which
  the electrons</span> <span m='366000'>are not shared equally. And so these strong
  ionic bonds</span> <span m='371000'>occur between elements with high electronegativity
  and low</span> <span m='377000'>electronegativity. So that's that concept.</span>
  </p><p><span m='381000'>And then, finally, one other kind of odd and end</span>
  <span m='385000'>here. That is this term</span> <span m='387000'>isoelectronic.
  I have listed here a bunch of</span> <span m='392000'>atoms and ions that are isoelectronic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='395000'>Isoelectronic means having the same electron structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='400000'>All of these atoms and ions have the electron configuration</span>
  <span m='405000'>1s 2 2s 2 2p 6.</span> </p><p><span m='408000'>For example, this
  nitrogen,</span> <span m='411000'>N minus 3, it has added three electrons to</span>
  <span m='415000'>be nitrogen minus three. It has added three electrons to</span>
  <span m='421000'>get this electron configuration, this rare gas configuration,</span>
  <span m='427000'>this octet configuration which is a very stable configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='433000'>Aluminum has three electrons removed to obtain this</span>
  <span m='438000'>particular electron configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='441000'>The
  common ions, ions that you see commonly in</span> <span m='445000'>nature, are ions
  that, in fact, do have this octet</span> <span m='450000'>configuration, this electron
  configuration of</span> <span m='454000'>an inert gas. For example,</span> <span
  m='457000'>you will often see compounds with nitrogen minus three.</span> </p><p><span
  m='462000'>You won't very often see a</span> <span m='464000'>compound with nitrogen
  minus two or nitrogen minus one</span> <span m='469000'>because those are not as
  stable as nitrogen minus</span> <span m='474000'>three, given this rare gas or the</span>
  <span m='477000'>octet configuration. All right.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>That
  is just a little odd and end.</span> </p><p><span m='484000'>I just wanted to make
  sure that everybody was on the same level</span> <span m='489000'>with the understanding
  of the word isoelectronic there.</span> </p><p><span m='495000'>Well, now what I
  thought I would do is talk a little bit</span> <span m='500000'>about wave functions
  and the usefulness of wave functions.</span> </p><p><span m='505000'>This is going
  to be on the side boards here.</span> </p><p><span m='511000'>I wanted to just show
  you in kind of simple terms how a wave</span> <span m='516000'>function actually
  determines the intensity of some transition.</span> </p><p><span m='522000'>Many
  of you have asked me about the intensities of transitions,</span> <span m='527000'>and
  so I thought I would show you just a little bit about how</span> <span m='533000'>these
  wave functions determine the intensities of transitions.</span> </p><p><span m='540000'>First
  of all, I have to explain this diagram</span> <span m='543000'>to you. This is going
  to be a diagram</span> <span m='546000'>for a hydrogen atom. That is what we are
  going to</span> <span m='550000'>talk about here. What we are going to start with</span>
  <span m='554000'>is an energy level diagram for the hydrogen atoms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='559000'>That is what this axis is. And so, I am plotting in that</span> <span
  m='563000'>diagram, energy, going up.</span> </p><p><span m='566000'>And I plot
  the energy level for n equals 1.</span> </p><p><span m='571000'>I plot the energy
  level for n equals 2, n equals 3,</span> <span m='577000'>all the way up to n equals
  235, which is really very close to</span> <span m='585000'>zero. That is part of
  what is on this</span> <span m='590000'>plot right here, n equals 1, n equals 2,</span>
  <span m='595000'>n equals 3. But then, what is also</span> <span m='600000'>typically
  done on the same plot is that the potential energy of</span> <span m='607000'>interaction
  is plotted as a function of r.</span> </p><p><span m='611000'>And so, on this axis
  here, kind of superimposed,</span> <span m='617000'>is this distance r. And we plot
  often the potential</span> <span m='622000'>energy of interaction. The potential
  energy of</span> <span m='627000'>interaction kind of looks like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='633000'>This potential energy of interaction is the Coulomb</span> <span m='637000'>interaction,
  minus e squared 4 pi epsilon nought times r.</span> </p><p><span m='643000'>That
  is what that line is on</span> <span m='648000'>this plot. Then what we do is we
  actually</span> <span m='651000'>plot the form of the wave function, kind of on
  top of the</span> <span m='656000'>energy levels. What we do is to say,</span> <span
  m='661000'>for example, take the n equals 1 wave</span> <span m='664000'>function,
  which starts at r equals 0 at some finite value</span> <span m='670000'>and it is
  just an exponential decay.</span> </p><p><span m='674000'>And we plot it on this
  diagram, but we use the n equals 1</span> <span m='679000'>energy here as the value
  of Psi equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='683000'>In other words, the n equals 1 wave
  function</span> <span m='688000'>looks kind of like that. This level here is Psi
  equals</span> <span m='696000'>whatever it is, at r equals 0,</span> <span m='698000'>and
  there is just an exponential decay.</span> </p><p><span m='701000'>We plot the wave
  function on top of that energy level.</span> </p><p><span m='706000'>In other words,
  this is a complex diagram here.</span> </p><p><span m='709000'>You are going to
  see, if you take any course beyond</span> <span m='713000'>this, this diagram a
  lot, with energy levels and wave</span> <span m='718000'>functions plotted on top
  of them.</span> </p><p><span m='722000'>And then, the n equals 2 wave function is
  plotted on top of</span> <span m='727000'>the n equals 2 energy level. Again, at
  r equals 0,</span> <span m='731000'>it is some finite value and then it drops.</span>
  </p><p><span m='734000'>At some value of r, we have a node for n equals 2</span>
  <span m='739000'>here. The n equals 2 is the Psi</span> <span m='741000'>equals
  0. Right here, you have a radial</span> <span m='745000'>node. Then it goes up and
  then it</span> <span m='747000'>comes back. It goes down to a negative</span> <span
  m='752000'>value and then comes back up. That is n equals 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='757000'>And so forth and so on. n equals 3 looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='762000'>It has two radial nodes. That is what that diagram is</span> <span m='767000'>showing
  here. And then we get to n equals</span> </p><p><span m='774000'>Is this is a hydrogen
  atom and you have n equals 235,</span> <span m='779000'>how many radial nodes do
  you have?</span> </p><p><span m='786000'>through this origin 234 times. That is
  the wave function.</span> </p><p><span m='791000'>And then it tails off. There is
  always an exponential</span> <span m='796000'>dependence there. That is what that
  wave function</span> <span m='800000'>looks like. Now, how do these relate to the</span>
  <span m='803000'>intensity of some transition? Well, the intensity of a</span> <span
  m='808000'>transition is related to the overlap between the wave</span> <span m='812000'>function
  of the initial state and the wave function of the</span> <span m='817000'>final
  state. What do I mean by overlap?</span> </p><p><span m='822000'>Well, by overlap,
  I mean you take the wave</span> <span m='826000'>function, here, of the initial
  state,</span> <span m='829000'>so I am going to pretend we have a hydrogen atom
  in the</span> <span m='834000'>state, this is its wave function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='837000'>And that hydrogen atom is going to be relaxing to the n equals 1</span>
  <span m='843000'>state. What I am going to do,</span> <span m='846000'>to get the
  overlap, is I'm going to take the</span> <span m='849000'>product of the wave function
  of the initial state times that of</span> <span m='854000'>the final state, and
  essentially I am going to</span> <span m='857000'>integrate that resulting function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='859000'>I am going to multiply these two wave functions together,</span>
  <span m='863000'>and I am going to integrate over all r the resulting</span> <span
  m='867000'>function. That is what I mean by overlap.</span> </p><p><span m='871000'>But
  there is another term here. There is an r,</span> <span m='873000'>too. That r is
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='875000'>It has to do with the transition moment
  dipole.</span> </p><p><span m='878000'>And we won't go into that, but it is there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='881000'>But it won't affect the argument I am going to make for</span>
  <span m='884000'>you right now. We take the wave function of</span> <span m='887000'>the
  initial state, multiply it by the final state</span> <span m='890000'>times r, and
  then we integrate this whole thing from r equals 0</span> <span m='894000'>to infinity
  and then square it. That quantity is proportional</span> <span m='900000'>to the
  intensity of some transition.</span> </p><p><span m='903000'>Let's do that. Here
  is Psi n equals 235,</span> <span m='907000'>we are multiplying it by Psi of</span>
  <span m='911000'>n equals 0 and actually multiplying it by r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='916000'>And what we are going to see, if we just look at this product</span>
  <span m='922000'>here, if we just looked at Psi n equals 235 and</span> <span m='928000'>Psi
  n equals 1, if we just looked at that</span> <span m='933000'>product, we are going
  to multiply this times that.</span> </p><p><span m='939000'>In a graphical form,
  it is going to look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='942000'>It is going to go
  up, down, up, down,</span> <span m='944000'>up, down. It is going to oscillate and</span>
  <span m='947000'>then tail off in an exponential way because we are multiply this</span>
  <span m='951000'>up, down, up, down, up down times this</span> <span m='953000'>exponential
  decay. It is going to look something</span> <span m='956000'>like that. But now,
  we are going to</span> <span m='960000'>integrate this resulting curve. What you
  can see is that the</span> <span m='964000'>area above this curve is equal to the
  area below this curve,</span> <span m='969000'>approximately. And, when we integrate</span>
  <span m='972000'>something, we are calculating the area underneath the curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='977000'>These positive areas are going to cancel these negative
  areas.</span> </p><p><span m='983000'>The result is that this integral is going
  to be very</span> <span m='987000'>small. And the result is that the</span> <span
  m='991000'>intensity of that line is very low.</span> </p><p><span m='994000'>The
  intensities are proportional to this overlap,</span> <span m='998000'>the overlap
  of the initial state wave function and the</span> <span m='1002000'>final state
  wave function. And you can see,</span> <span m='1006000'>here, graphically, how
  if you integrate that</span> <span m='1009000'>product in this case, the positive
  areas cancel the</span> <span m='1013000'>negative areas, and you don't have a very</span>
  <span m='1017000'>intense transition. However, suppose we look at the</span> <span
  m='1022000'>transition from n equals 3 to n equals 2.</span> </p><p><span m='1026000'>Well,
  here is the n equals 3 wave function,</span> <span m='1030000'>here is the n equals
  2 wave function.</span> </p><p><span m='1033000'>And our intensity expression says
  that we have to multiply</span> <span m='1039000'>these two. Let's do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1041000'>Let's multiply n equals 3 times n equals 2, here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1045000'>Well, the result, if you excuse my not so great</span>
  <span m='1050000'>drawing, is we start out with a very positive function here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1057000'>But then we have two negatives here, which make it a little
  bit</span> <span m='1062000'>less negative. But then, we have a positive,</span>
  <span m='1065000'>here, times a negative, and what that makes is a large</span>
  <span m='1070000'>area that is negative. And, if we go and integrate</span> <span
  m='1074000'>that, now we don't have the same cancellation of positive and</span>
  <span m='1079000'>negative areas. We integrate that,</span> <span m='1083000'>and
  that transition energy is large.</span> </p><p><span m='1086000'>Or, that area is
  large, therefore the intensity of that</span> <span m='1090000'>transition is large.
  Bottom line,</span> <span m='1092000'>that is one of the elements that dictates
  the intensity of a</span> <span m='1097000'>transition. It is also one of the elements</span>
  <span m='1100000'>that dictates the intensity of your photoelectron spectra.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1104000'>Somebody asked me about it the other day.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1109000'>I had drawn lines in the photoelectronic spectra that</span> <span m='1112000'>were
  of the same intensity, 1s, 2s, 2p 6.</span> </p><p><span m='1116000'>Somebody said,
  well, you have more electrons</span> <span m='1120000'>in the 2p state. Why don't
  you have a larger</span> <span m='1123000'>number of electrons coming off? The answer
  is,</span> <span m='1126000'>that is part of what goes into determining the intensity
  of the</span> <span m='1131000'>transition, but there is more to it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1134000'>It is not just the number of electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='1137000'>Here
  is one of the elements that goes into determining the</span> <span m='1141000'>intensity
  of some transition. It is the wave functions and</span> <span m='1147000'>the overlap
  between the final and the initial state.</span> </p><p><span m='1153000'>And then,
  I just wanted to also show you, here,</span> <span m='1157000'>for this atom in
  the n equals 235 state, I plotted just for</span> <span m='1163000'>fun, kind of
  schematically, what the radial probability</span> <span m='1169000'>distribution
  would look like. That is just r squared times</span> <span m='1175000'>the radial
  part squared. And, of course,</span> <span m='1178000'>since the wave function goes
  like this, oscillates,</span> <span m='1181000'>that is what the radial probability
  distribution is</span> <span m='1185000'>going to do. And you are going to see</span>
  <span m='1188000'>nodes here, 234 values of r, that is going to make the wave</span>
  <span m='1192000'>function be equal to zero. And then way out here,</span> <span
  m='1196000'>you are going to have a feature.</span> </p><p><span m='1200000'>That
  last feature, here, is going to have the</span> <span m='1204000'>maximum probability,
  and that is your value of r</span> <span m='1209000'>that is most probable. It turns
  out for n equals</span> <span m='1215000'>that the most probable value of r is 43,800
  angstroms.</span> </p><p><span m='1221000'>That is about 4.38x10^-6 meters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1224000'>This is a really large hydrogen atom, n equals 235.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1231000'>Do they exist? The answer is yes,</span> <span m='1233000'>they
  do exist. They exist, particularly in</span> <span m='1237000'>outer space, where
  there is lots of UV radiation to get these</span> <span m='1241000'>hydrogen atoms
  up into these very excited states.</span> </p><p><span m='1245000'>And they exist
  in deep outer space, where the temperatures</span> <span m='1250000'>are pretty
  cold. And you need those cold</span> <span m='1253000'>temperatures because this
  hydrogen atom is not very stable</span> <span m='1258000'>in n equals 235. And,
  if you went and calculated</span> <span m='1266000'>here, I am going to draw a line,
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1272000'>This is going to be n equals 235, and this
  is the zero of</span> <span m='1281000'>energy. This energy difference here is</span>
  <span m='1287000'>about 4x10^-23 joules. Whereas, at room temperature,</span> <span
  m='1294000'>we will just talk about the thermal energy,</span> <span m='1298000'>thermal
  energy is about 4x10^-21 joules.</span> </p><p><span m='1301000'>You can see that
  any little fluctuation at room temperature,</span> <span m='1306000'>since this
  is two orders of magnitude larger than what this</span> <span m='1312000'>bound
  by, any little fluctuation would kick this very weakly</span> <span m='1317000'>bound
  electron up and ionize it. And it would.</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>You really
  only see these in environments that are very cold,</span> <span m='1327000'>where
  you don't perturb what are called Rydberg atoms</span> <span m='1332000'>sometimes.
  I think in the laboratory the</span> <span m='1336000'>largest Rydberg atom that
  has been made is n equals 180 or n</span> <span m='1342000'>equals 200 or so. Anyway,
  that was really just</span> <span m='1346000'>for fun that I wanted to tell you
  about that.</span> </p><p><span m='1352000'>Now, there is another little tidbit
  that I want to talk to</span> <span m='1358000'>you about that has to do with how
  knowing something about the</span> <span m='1364000'>energy levels in an atom leads
  to a nice practical device,</span> <span m='1371000'>like a helium neon laser. We
  have to take a look at the</span> <span m='1377000'>neon energy levels. And so we
  have another</span> <span m='1382000'>discharge lamp here, and we have some more
  of these</span> <span m='1387000'>glasses, here, so that you can resolve the</span>
  <span m='1392000'>neon lines here. The TAs will get them out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1396000'>Here is our neon discharge lamp.</span> </p><p><span m='1407000'>You
  can resolve, here, the neon spectrum.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>The spectrum
  that you should see should be what is shown on</span> <span m='1414000'>the side
  walls here. Let me turn off the lights so</span> <span m='1418000'>that you can
  see it a little bit better, hopefully.</span> </p><p><span m='1432000'>You can see
  lots of lines in the case of neon because we have</span> <span m='1437000'>lots
  of different occupied states.</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>The glasses that I
  have actually are doing a phenomenal</span> <span m='1445000'>job in resolving those
  very closely spaced lines.</span> </p><p><span m='1450000'>I must have a better
  quality glass today.</span> </p><p><span m='1475000'>And, if you look at the side
  walls, you can see that I drew</span> <span m='1480000'>one of those lines. One
  of those emission lines is</span> <span m='1484000'>at 632 nanometers, which is
  the emission line of a</span> <span m='1488000'>helium neon laser. But it is really
  a neon</span> <span m='1492000'>transition that we will talk about in a moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1496000'>I drew it as very thick on the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1501000'>Because when I looked at the discharge lamp and drew that</span> <span
  m='1505000'>picture, my glasses did not resolve those lines so very</span> <span
  m='1510000'>well. And so that one looked really</span> <span m='1513000'>thick to
  me. At least my glasses,</span> <span m='1516000'>I can really see lots and lots
  of discrete lines.</span> </p><p><span m='1520000'>But it is this transition, 632
  nanometers,</span> <span m='1523000'>that is the output of the helium neon laser,</span>
  <span m='1527000'>which is the red laser that I use sometimes in the lecture,</span>
  <span m='1532000'>here, to point. It is the basis of the laser</span> <span m='1537000'>that
  is used in the grocery stores to scan the prices on</span> <span m='1543000'>your
  items. And it turns out that what is</span> <span m='1546000'>going on, here, is
  the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1550000'>If you look on the side walls, we
  have neon in the ground</span> <span m='1555000'>state before we turn the discharge
  on.</span> </p><p><span m='1560000'>And then, when we turn the discharge on,</span>
  <span m='1564000'>that pumps energy into the neon atoms such that one of those</span>
  <span m='1571000'>electrons, the 2p electron, gets promoted into the 5s</span> <span
  m='1577000'>state. And then, of course,</span> <span m='1580000'>that atom wants
  to relax. And so here it comes again.</span> </p><p><span m='1586000'>That 5s state
  relaxes. That electron relaxes to the 3p</span> <span m='1593000'>state. And it
  is actually that</span> <span m='1595000'>transition that occurs at 632.8 nanometers,
  the basis of the</span> <span m='1601000'>helium neon laser. It is that transition,</span>
  <span m='1605000'>from the 5s to the 3p. It is not all the way down,</span> <span
  m='1610000'>but ultimately, of course, that state relaxes.</span> </p><p><span m='1614000'>But
  what is going on in the helium neon laser?</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>Well,
  in the helium neon laser, we have a discharge ignited</span> <span m='1625000'>where
  we have a lot of neon atoms here in this excited</span> <span m='1630000'>state,
  with the one electron in the 5s state right as I show</span> <span m='1636000'>you.
  And that is emitting,</span> <span m='1638000'>a photon comes out. But what is happening
  here is</span> <span m='1644000'>that the photon that is emitted is able to, because
  of the</span> <span m='1650000'>construction of this laser, contact or to interact
  with</span> <span m='1656000'>another neon atom in this same excited state,</span>
  <span m='1661000'>that 2p 5 5s state. That photon interacts with this</span> <span
  m='1668000'>excited atom. When it interacts with that</span> <span m='1673000'>excited
  atom, what happens is that the photon</span> <span m='1678000'>stimulates that excited
  atom to actually emit a photon of the</span> <span m='1684000'>same energy. This
  photon stimulates this</span> <span m='1690000'>excited atom to release its energy
  right at that time.</span> </p><p><span m='1694000'>The result is that you have
  two photons coming out.</span> </p><p><span m='1698000'>They are going to come out
  in the same direction and they are</span> <span m='1703000'>going to be what is
  called coherent.</span> </p><p><span m='1706000'>That is, their phases are going
  to match.</span> </p><p><span m='1711000'>If you think now of the photon as a wave,
  they are going to be</span> <span m='1716000'>coherent. And the result is that you
  are</span> <span m='1719000'>going to have some radiation that is going to be twice
  as</span> <span m='1724000'>intense because they are coherent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1727000'>They are in phase. And then, what happens is that</span> <span m='1731000'>these
  two photons, they each then interact with</span> <span m='1735000'>another neon
  atom in this same excited state.</span> </p><p><span m='1741000'>And each of those
  photons stimulates another atom to emit</span> <span m='1746000'>photons. And the
  result is now that you</span> <span m='1749000'>have four photons being emitted,
  the same frequency,</span> <span m='1754000'>same direction, and same phase.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1757000'>And it is in this way that we amplify the light in any
  kind of</span> <span m='1762000'>laser. This is what is going on,</span> <span m='1765000'>this
  process of simulated emission.</span> </p><p><span m='1770000'>Where you have a
  photon that now is exactly the frequency of</span> <span m='1774000'>the energy
  difference of the transition that you are going to</span> <span m='1780000'>make
  in this excited atom. This stimulates that atom to</span> <span m='1784000'>emit
  a photon. The two photons then come off</span> <span m='1788000'>coherently. And
  then, these two interact</span> <span m='1791000'>with two other atoms. Now you
  have four photons that</span> <span m='1795000'>are coming off. That is the process
  of</span> <span m='1798000'>amplification in any type of laser.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1808000'>Of course, in order to make this work, you have to have a</span> <span
  m='1813000'>lot of these excited neon atoms around because you have to be</span>
  <span m='1819000'>able to have a photon interact with them before they just emit</span>
  <span m='1825000'>spontaneously. This is stimulated emission.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1830000'>The other kind of emission that we were talking about is</span> <span
  m='1834000'>spontaneous emission. In other words,</span> <span m='1836000'>you have
  to have a high concentration of these excited</span> <span m='1840000'>neon atoms
  so that the photons that are originally emitted</span> <span m='1844000'>here, by
  just spontaneous emission, can interact with</span> <span m='1848000'>those excited
  state neon atoms and stimulate the emission and</span> <span m='1852000'>get this
  whole process rolling. In order to produce a whole lot</span> <span m='1857000'>of
  those excited neon atoms, what happens is we add in a</span> <span m='1861000'>little
  bit of helium. It turns out that in helium</span> <span m='1866000'>there are some
  excited states that are just,</span> <span m='1870000'>by accident, at the same
  energy as this</span> <span m='1873000'>excited state of neon. And the helium actually</span>
  <span m='1877000'>transfers its energy to the neon, into this state,</span> <span
  m='1881000'>and maintains, then, that very high population</span> <span m='1885000'>of
  neon atoms here in this excited state.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>That is the
  function of the helium.</span> </p><p><span m='1892000'>It is just the energy transfer
  from the helium excited state to</span> <span m='1897000'>the neon excited state.
  It keeps the population of the</span> <span m='1902000'>neon atoms really high.
  The helium, you don't see that</span> <span m='1906000'>emission. That is just a
  helper in this</span> <span m='1909000'>device. It is the neon transition that</span>
  <span m='1913000'>you are looking at here. That was just a short story</span> <span
  m='1919000'>about the usefulness of knowing about the energy levels in atoms</span>
  <span m='1926000'>and how ultimately you can make a practical device because you</span>
  <span m='1934000'>know something about the energy levels of your atoms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1940000'>Well, that is going to finish up, right now,</span> <span m='1945000'>our
  discussion of atoms. And now, it is time to move</span> <span m='1952000'>onto one
  of the very important parts of chemistry,</span> <span m='1956000'>and that is chemical
  bonds and the combination of atoms to form</span> <span m='1962000'>a chemical bond.
  That is what we are going to</span> <span m='1966000'>start talking about, now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1968000'>Today, what we are going to do is just talk about the</span>
  <span m='1973000'>fundamental interactions that are present in every chemical</span>
  <span m='1978000'>bond. Let's start with that.</span> </p><p><span m='1982000'>Let
  me come over here while the lights are warming up so you can</span> <span m='1987000'>see
  that board. Suppose we have a hydrogen atom</span> <span m='1992000'>here, nucleus
  a, plus charge.</span> </p><p><span m='1994000'>And it, of course, has electron
  a attached to it.</span> </p><p><span m='1999000'>And way out here, we have nucleus
  b and electron</span> <span m='2003000'>b that is attached to it. And they are very
  far apart.</span> </p><p><span m='2010000'>And so, in this case, where they are
  very far apart,</span> <span m='2014000'>the energy of interaction is just the energy
  of interaction</span> <span m='2019000'>between the electron and the nucleus, the
  electron-nuclear</span> <span m='2024000'>attraction. Here it is, the</span> <span
  m='2026000'>electron-nuclear attraction. However, as we bring these two</span> <span
  m='2032000'>hydrogen atoms together, at some point this electron</span> <span m='2036000'>that
  was only attracted to nucleus a is now begins to</span> <span m='2041000'>experience
  an attraction with nucleus b.</span> </p><p><span m='2046000'>And this electron
  that was attracted only to nucleus b</span> <span m='2050000'>experiences an interaction
  whereby it is now attracted to</span> <span m='2054000'>nucleus a. And that kind
  of mutual</span> <span m='2057000'>attractive interaction then brings those two
  nuclei closer</span> <span m='2062000'>together. However, at the same time,</span>
  <span m='2065000'>when you bring those two nuclei closer together,</span> <span
  m='2069000'>you are bringing the electrons closer together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2074000'>And so there is an electron-electron repulsion that</span> <span m='2078000'>is
  present. In addition,</span> <span m='2080000'>as you bring these two nuclei together,
  what is happening here</span> <span m='2085000'>is you are having a nuclear-nuclear
  repulsion.</span> </p><p><span m='2089000'>A chemical bond is really the sum of
  these three interactions</span> <span m='2094000'>and the interplay between these
  three interactions.</span> </p><p><span m='2100000'>That is what we want to try
  to look at and try to understand.</span> </p><p><span m='2105000'>How are we going
  to do that? Well, the first thing I am</span> <span m='2110000'>going to do is I
  am going to draw an energy of interaction as</span> <span m='2115000'>a function
  of the distance between the two hydrogen atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='2121000'>I
  am going to take two hydrogen atoms and I am going to call the</span> <span m='2126000'>distance
  between them r. Now, I have changed my</span> <span m='2132000'>definition of r.
  r is the distance between the</span> <span m='2136000'>two nuclei. It is no longer
  the distance</span> <span m='2139000'>between the nucleus and the electron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2143000'>I have just changed my definition of r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2146000'>And I am going to plot the energy of interaction as a</span> <span m='2151000'>function
  of that distance between the two nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='2155000'>Here is
  my energy of interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2160000'>There is going to be a
  zero of energy, here.</span> </p><p><span m='2164000'>I am going to plot this as
  a function of r,</span> <span m='2168000'>and the plot is going to look like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2172000'>Way out here, where r is large,</span> <span m='2175000'>I
  have two separated hydrogen atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='2179000'>The energy, here,
  is minus 2,624 kilojoules per</span> <span m='2184000'>mole. That is what this energy
  of</span> <span m='2187000'>interaction is, here.</span> </p><p><span m='2191000'>Now,
  as I bring these two hydrogen atoms together,</span> <span m='2195000'>what happens
  is that this energy is going to decrease.</span> </p><p><span m='2200000'>And it
  is going to keep decreasing until we get to some</span> <span m='2204000'>point.
  And then, as r gets even</span> <span m='2207000'>smaller, that energy of interaction
  is going to</span> <span m='2211000'>skyrocket and go to infinity. Starting about
  here somewhere,</span> <span m='2216000'>where the energy of interaction is less,
  is more negative than</span> <span m='2222000'>the separated hydrogen atoms. Well,
  what that means is that</span> <span m='2228000'>we are forming a chemical bond.
  The two hydrogen atoms are more</span> <span m='2232000'>stable then when they are
  separated.</span> </p><p><span m='2235000'>The two hydrogen atoms are bound as soon
  as this energy of</span> <span m='2239000'>interaction gets more negative than the
  separated atom limit.</span> </p><p><span m='2244000'>And it keeps getting more
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='2246000'>And, of course, the value of r at which
  that</span> <span m='2249000'>energy of interaction is a maximum negative number,</span>
  <span m='2253000'>well, that is the equilibrium bond length.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2258000'>This is the most stable value of r at which the energy is the</span>
  <span m='2265000'>lowest. It is the most stable</span> <span m='2269000'>configuration.
  In the case of hydrogen,</span> <span m='2274000'>that value of r is 0.74 angstroms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2280000'>In this potential energy curve, as it is often called,</span>
  <span m='2285000'>everywhere where this energy of interaction is lower than the</span>
  <span m='2291000'>separated hydrogen atom limit, everywhere here,</span> <span m='2295000'>this
  is called the attractive region of the interaction</span> <span m='2301000'>potential.
  It is attractive because the</span> <span m='2304000'>hydrogen atoms bound are more
  stable than they are separated.</span> </p><p><span m='2312000'>Or, the hydrogen
  atoms are bound.</span> </p><p><span m='2314000'>They are more stable than the two
  hydrogen atoms separated.</span> </p><p><span m='2320000'>We call this the attractive
  region of the potential energy</span> <span m='2325000'>curve. We also call this
  region,</span> <span m='2327000'>this attractive region, we call that the well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2331000'>And the well depth, here, from the bottom to the</span>
  <span m='2336000'>separated hydrogen atom limit, if you measure the energy from</span>
  <span m='2341000'>the bottom up, that energy is the bond</span> <span m='2344000'>association
  energy. We are going to call it delta E</span> <span m='2350000'>sub d, from the
  bottom here to the</span> <span m='2354000'>separated hydrogen atom limit. That
  is the bond energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2358000'>432 kilojoules per mole is the
  energy that you have to put into</span> <span m='2363000'>the H two molecule to
  separate it.</span> </p><p><span m='2368000'>You have to get it from the bottom
  of this well to the</span> <span m='2372000'>separated hydrogen atom limit here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2375000'>Now, you can also see, here, as you push those two</span>
  <span m='2379000'>hydrogen atoms even closer together than the equilibrium</span>
  <span m='2383000'>bond length, you can see that the energy is going back up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2388000'>And at some point, if you push the two hydrogen</span>
  <span m='2392000'>atoms close enough together such that the energy is equal to that</span>
  <span m='2397000'>of the separated hydrogen atom, it then becomes greater than</span>
  <span m='2402000'>that of the separated hydrogen atom.</span> </p><p><span m='2407000'>From
  this value of r on, the hydrogen atoms are no</span> <span m='2410000'>longer bound
  because their energy is greater than the</span> <span m='2414000'>separated hydrogen
  atom limit. We call this part of the</span> <span m='2418000'>potential energy of
  interaction the repulsive part.</span> </p><p><span m='2422000'>In other words,
  as you push the two hydrogen</span> <span m='2426000'>atoms closer together, they
  form a bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2430000'>But if you push them too close, they
  are going to fly apart.</span> </p><p><span m='2436000'>They are no longer bound.
  This is the general potential</span> <span m='2442000'>energy of interaction for
  every chemical bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2446000'>Every single bond has this
  general shape.</span> </p><p><span m='2451000'>That is important. But that shape
  is really a</span> <span m='2455000'>consequence of these three interactions that
  I talked about</span> <span m='2461000'>when we started this problem, here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2467000'>And so, what I want to try to do is now try to dissect
  that</span> <span m='2471000'>curve into the three components that give rise to
  that potential</span> <span m='2477000'>energy of interaction, that dependence as
  a function</span> <span m='2481000'>of r. I want to pull that apart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2490000'>This energy of interaction is the sum of the nuclear</span> <span m='2496000'>repulsion.
  Pushing the nuclei too close</span> <span m='2501000'>together, there is a repulsive
  interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2507000'>That is one of the interactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2511000'>Plus, the electron-nuclear attraction is the attraction</span>
  <span m='2518000'>between the electron and the nucleus on which it came in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2527000'>And also between the electron and the other nucleus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2531000'>That is the electron-nuclear attraction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2534000'>Plus the electron-electron repulsive.</span> </p><p><span m='2537000'>Well,
  when you bring two hydrogen atoms together those</span> <span m='2541000'>electrons
  are going to repel. That is the energy of</span> <span m='2545000'>interaction.
  It is the sum of those three</span> <span m='2548000'>fundamental interactions.
  But what I want to do is figure</span> <span m='2554000'>out an r dependence for
  each one of these interactions.</span> </p><p><span m='2559000'>And the sum of that
  r dependence should give me a</span> <span m='2564000'>shape that looks like this.
  I want to see which</span> <span m='2568000'>interactions are important at what
  values of r.</span> </p><p><span m='2573000'>Let me start. Let's start with the</span>
  <span m='2576000'>nuclear-nuclear repulsion here. If I wanted an r dependence for</span>
  <span m='2581000'>what that nuclear-nuclear repulsion looked like,</span> <span
  m='2584000'>what would that be?</span> </p><p><span m='2591000'>Coulomb force. It
  is the repulsive Coulomb</span> <span m='2594000'>interaction. It is e squared over
  4 pi</span> <span m='2598000'>epsilon nought r.</span> </p><p><span m='2602000'>This
  is just two like charges that are repelling.</span> </p><p><span m='2607000'>And
  so now let me draw that repulsive interaction as a</span> <span m='2612000'>function
  of r on an energy level diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='2617000'>Here is my energy
  of interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='2620000'>It is a function of r. There is
  going to be a zero</span> <span m='2624000'>here. And this repulsive interaction</span>
  <span m='2628000'>is going to be positive everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='2631000'>It
  is going to be infinite here and a one over r</span> <span m='2636000'>dependence
  coming down. This is the Coulomb</span> <span m='2641000'>interaction. This is the
  nuclear-nuclear</span> <span m='2645000'>repulsion. That is what it looks like as
  a</span> <span m='2649000'>function of r. That is one component.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2652000'>Now, what about the other components here?</span> </p><p><span m='2656000'>Well,
  it turns out I have no simple way of estimating what</span> <span m='2661000'>the
  r dependence is for the electron-nuclear attraction.</span> </p><p><span m='2668000'>I
  have no simple way of estimating what the r dependence</span> <span m='2672000'>is
  for the electron-electron repulsion.</span> </p><p><span m='2675000'>And I have
  no simple way of doing that for the sum of those</span> <span m='2679000'>two terms.
  Actually, the sum of these two</span> <span m='2682000'>terms, I am going to call
  the electron interactions.</span> </p><p><span m='2686000'>Each one of these terms
  involves the electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2690000'>The is the electron-electron
  repulsion, electron-nuclear</span> <span m='2694000'>attraction. This term does
  not have any</span> <span m='2697000'>electrons in it. I have no simple way of telling</span>
  <span m='2703000'>you or estimating what the r dependence is of the sum of</span>
  <span m='2709000'>these two terms. However, what I can do is</span> <span m='2713000'>figure
  out what the energy is for the sum of those two</span> <span m='2718000'>interactions
  at two extremes. I can tell you what the energy</span> <span m='2725000'>is at r
  equal infinity, and then I can tell you what it</span> <span m='2730000'>is at r
  equal zero. And, therefore,</span> <span m='2735000'>on this plot, I am going to
  come in with a</span> <span m='2738000'>value for r equal infinity and a value for
  r equal zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2743000'>I am going to draw a straight line
  as an estimate for the r</span> <span m='2748000'>dependence. Then I am going to
  add them up</span> <span m='2751000'>and see if the result looks, in fact, like
  this energy of</span> <span m='2756000'>interaction that I drew for you. And so
  that is what I am going</span> <span m='2762000'>to have to do on Friday. I will
  see you on Wednesday,</span> <span m='2766000'>if not sooner.</span> </p>
