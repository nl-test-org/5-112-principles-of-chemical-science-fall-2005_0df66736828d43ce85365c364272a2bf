  \ <span m='6000'>Additional information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare\
  \ in general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>And your equation\
  \ is equal to E Psi.</span> <span m='18000'>And we saw that these energies, the\
  \ binding energies of the</span> <span m='25000'>electron to the nucleus, were quantized.</span>\
  \ <span m='35000'>Well, these energy levels then were given by minus this Rydberg</span>\
  \ <span m='41000'>constant R sub H over n squared. And this n</span> <span m='48000'>was\
  \ our quantum number. It is a principle quantum</span> <span m='53000'>number. And\
  \ we saw that n,</span> <span m='56000'>the smallest value was 1, 2 and ran all\
  \ the way up to</span> <span m='61000'>infinity. Well, today what we are going</span>\
  \ <span m='68000'>to do is solve this equation, or we are going to look at the</span>\
  \ <span m='76000'>results of solving this equation for the wavefunction Psi.</span>\
  \ <span m='84000'>Now, Psi, in general, is the function of r,</span> <span m='90000'>theta,\
  \ phi, and also time. But we are going to be looking</span> <span m='98000'>at problems\
  \ in which time does not have an effect.</span> <span m='102000'>In other words,\
  \ the wave functions that we are</span> <span m='107000'>going to be looking at\
  \ are what are called stationary waves.</span> <span m='113000'>We actually are\
  \ not going to be looking at the wave function as</span> <span m='119000'>a chemical\
  \ reaction is happening.</span> <span m='124000'>We are either going to look at\
  \ it before or after,</span> <span m='128000'>but not during. And, in those cases,</span>\
  \ <span m='131000'>we are looking at a wave function.</span> <span m='134000'>And\
  \ the atom is just stable and is sitting there.</span> <span m='138000'>The time\
  \ dependence here does not have a consequence.</span> <span m='143000'>And so, therefore,\
  \ the wave functions that we are</span> <span m='147000'>going to be looking at\
  \ are just a function of r,</span> <span m='151000'>theta and phi. And we are looking\
  \ at what is</span> <span m='156000'>called time-independent quantum mechanics.</span>\
  \ <span m='160000'>Later on, actually, if you are in chemistry,</span> <span m='165000'>in\
  \ a graduate course in chemistry, is when you look at</span> <span m='170000'>time-dependent\
  \ wave functions. We are going to look at</span> <span m='175000'>time-independent\
  \ quantum mechanics, the stationary wave.</span> <span m='182000'>Now, it turns\
  \ out that when we go and solve the Schr\u02C6dinger</span> <span m='186000'>equation\
  \ here for Psi, what happens is that two more</span> <span m='190000'>quantum numbers\
  \ drop out of that solution to the differential</span> <span m='195000'>equation.\
  \ Remember, we said last time how</span> <span m='199000'>quantum numbers arise.\
  \ They arise from imposing</span> <span m='202000'>boundary conditions on a differential\
  \ equation,</span> <span m='206000'>making that differential equation applicable\
  \ to your</span> <span m='210000'>actual physical problem. And so, when we do that,</span>\
  \ <span m='216000'>we get a new quantum number called l.</span> <span m='220000'>And\
  \ l is, I think you already know, the angular momentum</span> <span m='227000'>quantum\
  \ number. Absolutely.</span> <span m='230000'>It is called the angular momentum\
  \ quantum number because</span> <span m='236000'>it indeed dictates how much angular\
  \ momentum the electron</span> <span m='243000'>has. It has allowed values.</span>\
  \ <span m='248000'>The allowed values of l, now, are zero.</span> <span m='254000'>Zero\
  \ is the smallest value of l, the lowest value of l</span> <span m='262000'>allowed.\
  \ 1, 2, all the way up to n minus</span> <span m='272000'>can have. It cannot be\
  \ any larger than n</span> <span m='276000'>minus 1. Why can't it be larger than\
  \ n</span> <span m='279000'>minus 1? Well, it cannot because the</span> <span m='282000'>angular\
  \ momentum quantum number, at least if you want to think</span> <span m='288000'>classically\
  \ for a moment, dictates how much rotational</span> <span m='293000'>kinetic energy\
  \ you have. And remember that this energy,</span> <span m='298000'>here, is dependent\
  \ only on n. This energy is the sum of</span> <span m='303000'>kinetic energy plus\
  \ potential energy.</span> <span m='306000'>If l had the same value as n, well,\
  \ essentially,</span> <span m='310000'>that would mean that we would have only rotational\
  \ kinetic</span> <span m='315000'>energy and we would have no potential energy.</span>\
  \ <span m='318000'>But that is not right. We have potential energy.</span> <span\
  \ m='322000'>We have potential energy of interaction.</span> <span m='325000'>So,\
  \ physically, that is why l is tied to n.</span> <span m='330000'>And it cannot\
  \ be larger than n minus 1.</span> <span m='334000'>And then, we have a third quantum\
  \ number that drops out of</span> <span m='341000'>that solution, which is called\
  \ M.</span> <span m='345000'>It is the magnetic quantum number.</span> <span m='349000'>It\
  \ is called that because indeed it dictates how an atom</span> <span m='355000'>moves\
  \ in a magnetic field. Or, how it behaves in a</span> <span m='363000'>magnetic\
  \ field. But, more precisely,</span> <span m='367000'>m is the z-component of the\
  \ angular momentum.</span> <span m='373000'>l is the total angular moment. m dictates\
  \ the z-component of</span> <span m='381000'>the angular momentum. And the allowed\
  \ values of m are</span> <span m='387000'>m equals zero. You can have no angular</span>\
  \ <span m='393000'>momentum in the z-component. Or, plus one,</span> <span m='398000'>plus\
  \ two, plus three, all the way up to plus l.</span> <span m='404000'>Again, m is\
  \ tied to l. It cannot be larger than l,</span> <span m='410000'>because if it were\
  \ then you would have more angular momentum</span> <span m='418000'>in the z-component\
  \ than you had total angular momentum.</span> <span m='426000'>And that is a no-no.\
  \ So, m is tied to l.</span> <span m='430000'>The largest value you can have is\
  \ l.</span> <span m='434000'>But, since this is a z-component and we've got some</span>\
  \ <span m='441000'>direction, m could also be minus 1, minus two,</span> <span m='446000'>minus\
  \ three, minus l.</span> <span m='450000'>We have three quantum numbers, now.</span>\
  \ <span m='453000'>That kind of makes sense because we have a 3-dimensional</span>\
  \ <span m='459000'>problem. We are going to have to have</span> <span m='463000'>three\
  \ quantum numbers to completely describe our system.</span> <span m='469000'>The\
  \ consequence, here, of having three quantum</span> <span m='474000'>numbers is\
  \ that we now have more states.</span> <span m='491000'>For example, our n equals\
  \ 1 state that we</span> <span m='494000'>talked about last time, more completely\
  \ we have to</span> <span m='498000'>describe that state by two other quantum numbers.</span>\
  \ <span m='501000'>When n is equal to one, what is the only value that l</span>\
  \ <span m='505000'>can have? Zero.</span> <span m='507000'>And if l is zero, what\
  \ is the only value m can</span> <span m='510000'>have? Zero.</span> <span m='512000'>And\
  \ so, more appropriately, or more completely,</span> <span m='517000'>that n equals\
  \ 1 state is the (1, 0, 0) state.</span> <span m='522000'>And, if we have an electron\
  \ in that (1, 0, 0) state,</span> <span m='528000'>we are going to describe that\
  \ electron by the wave function</span> <span m='535000'>Psi(1, 0, 0). Now, what\
  \ I have not told you</span> <span m='540000'>yet is exactly how Psi represents\
  \ the electron.</span> <span m='545000'>I am just telling you right now that Psi\
  \ does.</span> <span m='549000'>Exactly how it does is something I haven't told\
  \ you</span> <span m='554000'>yet. And we will do that later in</span> <span m='557000'>the\
  \ lecture today, sort of.</span> <span m='560000'>That is the energy, minus the\
  \ Rydberg constant.</span> <span m='564000'>But now, if n is equal two, what is\
  \ the smallest value that</span> <span m='570000'>l can have? Zero.</span> <span\
  \ m='573000'>And the value of m in that case?</span> <span m='576000'>Zero. And\
  \ so our n equals 2 state is</span> <span m='579000'>more completely the (2, 0,\
  \ 0) state.</span> <span m='582000'>And the wave function that describes the electron\
  \ in that</span> <span m='587000'>state is the Psi(2, 0, 0) wave function.</span>\
  \ <span m='591000'>And then, of course, here is the energy of that</span> <span\
  \ m='595000'>state. Now, when n is equal to 2,</span> <span m='598000'>what is the\
  \ next larger value of l?</span> <span m='603000'>One. And if l is equal to one,</span>\
  \ <span m='605000'>what is the largest value that m can be?</span> <span m='609000'>One.\
  \ And so we have another state</span> <span m='612000'>here, the (2, 1, 1) state.</span>\
  \ <span m='614000'>And if you have an electron in that state, it is described by</span>\
  \ <span m='619000'>the Psi(2, 1, 1) wave function.</span> <span m='622000'>However,\
  \ the energy here is also minus one-quarter the</span> <span m='627000'>Rydberg\
  \ constant. It has the same energy as the</span> <span m='632000'>(2, 0, 0) state.\
  \ Now, if n is equal two and l is</span> <span m='636000'>equal to one, what is\
  \ the next larger value</span> <span m='640000'>of m? Zero. And so we have a (2,\
  \ 1, 0) state.</span> <span m='643000'>Again, that wave function, for an electron\
  \ in that state,</span> <span m='648000'>we label as Psi(2, 1, 0).</span> <span\
  \ m='650000'>And then, finally, when n is equal to two,</span> <span m='653000'>l\
  \ is equal to one, what is the final possible</span> <span m='657000'>value of m?\
  \ Minus one.</span> <span m='661000'>We have a (2, 1, -1) state and a wave</span>\
  \ <span m='664000'>function that is the (2, 1, -1) wave function.</span> <span m='669000'>Notice\
  \ that the energy of all of these four states is the</span> <span m='675000'>same,\
  \ minus one-quarter the Rydberg constant.</span> <span m='680000'>These states are\
  \ what we call degenerate.</span> <span m='684000'>Degenerate means having the same\
  \ energy.</span> <span m='690000'>That is important. Now, this is the way we label</span>\
  \ <span m='694000'>wave functions, but we also have a different</span> <span m='698000'>scheme\
  \ for talking about wave functions.</span> <span m='702000'>That is, we have an\
  \ orbital scheme.</span> <span m='706000'>And, as I said, or alluded to the other\
  \ day,</span> <span m='710000'>an orbital is nothing other than a wave function.</span>\
  \ <span m='715000'>It is a solution to the Schr\u02C6dinger equation.</span> <span\
  \ m='721000'>That is what an orbital is. It is actually the spatial part</span>\
  \ <span m='724000'>of the wave function. There is another part called</span> <span\
  \ m='728000'>the spin part, which we will deal with later,</span> <span m='731000'>but\
  \ an orbital is essentially a wave function.</span> <span m='734000'>We have a different\
  \ language for describing orbitals.</span> <span m='737000'>The way we do this,\
  \ I think you are already</span> <span m='740000'>familiar with, but we are going\
  \ to describe it</span> <span m='743000'>by the principle quantum number and, of\
  \ course,</span> <span m='746000'>the angular momentum quantum number and the magnetic\
  \ quantum</span> <span m='750000'>number. Except that we have a scheme or</span>\
  \ <span m='755000'>a code for l and m. That code uses letters instead</span> <span\
  \ m='760000'>of numbers. For example,</span> <span m='762000'>if l is equal to zero\
  \ here, we call that an s wave function</span> <span m='768000'>or an s orbital.\
  \ For example,</span> <span m='771000'>in the orbital language, instead of Psi(1,</span>\
  \ <span m='775000'>0, 0), we call this a 1s orbital.</span> <span m='780000'>Here\
  \ is the principle quantum number.</span> <span m='782000'>Here is s. l is equal\
  \ to zero.</span> <span m='785000'>That is just our code for l is equal to zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='788000'>This state, (2, 0, 0), you have an electron in</span> <span m='792000'>that\
  \ state. Well, it can describe that</span> <span m='795000'>wavefunction by the\
  \ 2s orbital. Here is the principle quantum</span> <span m='799000'>number. He is\
  \ s, our code for l equals</span> <span m='802000'>zero. Now, when n is equal to\
  \ 1,</span> <span m='805000'>we call that a p wave function or a p orbital.</span>\
  \ <span m='810000'>This state right here, it is the 2p state.</span> <span m='813000'>Because\
  \ n is two and l is one, this state is also the 2p wave</span> <span m='819000'>function\
  \ and this state, it is also the 2p wave</span> <span m='824000'>function. Now,\
  \ if I had a wave function</span> <span m='827000'>up here where l was equal to\
  \ two, we would call that d</span> <span m='832000'>orbital. And, if I had a wave\
  \ function</span> <span m='836000'>up here where l was three, we would call that\
  \ an f</span> <span m='840000'>orbital. But now, all of these wave</span> <span\
  \ m='845000'>functions in the orbital language have the same</span> <span m='849000'>designation,\
  \ and that is because we have not taken care of this</span> <span m='855000'>yet,\
  \ the m quantum number, magnetic quantum number.</span> <span m='859000'>And we\
  \ also have an alphabet scheme for those quantum</span> <span m='864000'>numbers.\
  \ The bottom line is that when m</span> <span m='867000'>is equal to zero, we put\
  \ a z subscript on the p.</span> <span m='873000'>When m is equal to zero, that\
  \ is our 2pz wave function.</span> <span m='879000'>When m is equal to one, we are\
  \ going to put an x</span> <span m='884000'>subscript on the p wave function.</span>\
  \ <span m='887000'>And when m is equal to minus one, we are going to put a y</span>\
  \ <span m='894000'>subscription on the wave function.</span> <span m='899000'>However,\
  \ I have to tell you that in the case of m is equal</span> <span m='904000'>to one\
  \ and m is equal to minus one, that is not strictly</span> <span m='908000'>correct.\
  \ And the reason it is not is</span> <span m='912000'>because when you solve Schr\u02C6\
  dinger equation for the (2,</span> <span m='916000'>1, 1) wave function and the\
  \ (2, 1, -1) wave function,</span> <span m='921000'>the solutions are complex wave\
  \ functions.</span> <span m='925000'>They are not real wave function.</span> <span\
  \ m='929000'>And so, in order for us to be able to draw and think about the</span>\
  \ <span m='935000'>px and the py wave functions, what we do is we take a linear</span>\
  \ <span m='942000'>combination of the px and the py wave functions.</span> <span\
  \ m='947000'>We take a positive linear combination, in the case of the</span> <span\
  \ m='954000'>px wave function. The px wave function is really</span> <span m='959000'>this\
  \ wave function plus this wave function.</span> <span m='963000'>And the py wave\
  \ function is really this wave function minus</span> <span m='968000'>this wave\
  \ function. Then we will get a real</span> <span m='972000'>function, and that is\
  \ easier to deal with.</span> <span m='975000'>That is strictly what px and py are.</span>\
  \ <span m='978000'>px and py are these linear combinations of the actual</span>\
  \ <span m='983000'>functions that come out of the Schr\u02C6dinger equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='989000'>pz is exactly correct. pz, M is equal to zero,</span> <span m='992000'>in\
  \ the pz wavefunction. Now, you are not responsible</span> <span m='996000'>for\
  \ knowing that. I just wanted to let you know.</span> <span m='1000000'>You don't\
  \ have to remember that m equal to one gives you the x</span> <span m='1005000'>subscript,\
  \ and m equal to minus one gives you the y subscript.</span> <span m='1010000'>You\
  \ do have to know that when m is equal to zero,</span> <span m='1014000'>you get\
  \ a z subscript, because that is exactly right.</span> <span m='1020000'>Now, just\
  \ one other comment here.</span> <span m='1023000'>That is, you see we did not put\
  \ a subscript on the s wave</span> <span m='1028000'>functions. Well, that is because\
  \ for an s</span> <span m='1033000'>wave function, the only choice you have for\
  \ m</span> <span m='1037000'>is zero. And so we leave out that</span> <span m='1040000'>subscript.\
  \ We never put a z on there or a</span> <span m='1044000'>z on there. It is always\
  \ 1s,</span> <span m='1047000'>2s, or 3s. Well, in order to understand</span> <span\
  \ m='1052000'>that just a little more, let's draw an energy level</span> <span m='1057000'>diagram.\
  \ Here is the energy again.</span> <span m='1061000'>And for n equals 1, we now\
  \ see that the more</span> <span m='1065000'>complete description is three quantum\
  \ numbers,</span> <span m='1070000'>(1, 0, 0). That gives us the (1,</span> <span\
  \ m='1073000'>0, 0) state, or sometimes we say the 1s</span> <span m='1077000'>state.\
  \ There is one state at that</span> <span m='1080000'>energy. But, in the case of\
  \ n equals 2,</span> <span m='1085000'>we already saw that we have four different\
  \ states for the</span> <span m='1091000'>quantum number. Four different states.</span>\
  \ <span m='1094000'>They all have the same energy. They are degenerate.</span> <span\
  \ m='1099000'>Degenerate means having the same energy.</span> <span m='1103000'>They\
  \ differ in how much angular momentum the electron has.</span> <span m='1110000'>Or,\
  \ how much angular momentum the electron would have in the z</span> <span m='1115000'>component\
  \ if it were in a magnetic field.</span> <span m='1118000'>The total energy is the\
  \ same because only n determines the</span> <span m='1123000'>energy. It is just\
  \ that the amount of</span> <span m='1126000'>angular momentum, or the z component\
  \ of the</span> <span m='1130000'>angular momentum, differs in 2s,</span> <span\
  \ m='1132000'>2py, 2pz, 2px, but they all have the same</span> <span m='1136000'>energy.\
  \ In general, for any value of n,</span> <span m='1141000'>there are n squared degenerate\
  \ states at each value of n.</span> <span m='1148000'>If we have n is equal to three,\
  \ then the energy is minus</span> <span m='1154000'>one-ninth the Rydberg constant.\
  \ But how many states do we have</span> <span m='1161000'>at n equal three? Nine.</span>\
  \ <span m='1164000'>Here they are. Just like for n equal two,</span> <span m='1168000'>we\
  \ have the 3s, 3py, 3pz, and 3px.</span> <span m='1174000'>And there are the associated\
  \ quantum numbers for that.</span> <span m='1178000'>But now we have some states\
  \ here that I have labeled 3d</span> <span m='1184000'>states. Well, when you have\
  \ a d state,</span> <span m='1187000'>that means l is equal to two. All of these\
  \ states have</span> <span m='1192000'>principle quantum number three and angular\
  \ momentum quantum</span> <span m='1198000'>number two. And they differ also by\
  \ the</span> <span m='1203000'>amount of angular momentum in the z direction.</span>\
  \ <span m='1208000'>They differ in the quantum number m.</span> <span m='1212000'>For\
  \ example, we are going to call the m</span> <span m='1216000'>equal minus two state\
  \ the 3d(xy).</span> <span m='1220000'>We are going to put xy as a subscript.</span>\
  \ <span m='1224000'>For m equal minus one, we are going to put a subscript</span>\
  \ <span m='1230000'>yz. For m equals zero,</span> <span m='1233000'>we are going\
  \ to put a subscript z squared.</span> <span m='1238000'>For m equal one, d(xz).</span>\
  \ <span m='1240000'>And for m equal two, x squared minus y squared.</span> <span\
  \ m='1244000'>Again, for m equal minus two,</span> <span m='1249000'>minus one,\
  \ one and two, those wave functions,</span> <span m='1254000'>when you solve Schr\u02C6\
  dinger equations, are complex wave</span> <span m='1259000'>functions. And what\
  \ we do to talk about</span> <span m='1264000'>the wave functions is we take linear\
  \ combinations of them to</span> <span m='1268000'>make them real. And so, when\
  \ I say m is minus</span> <span m='1272000'>two, is the 3dxy wave function, it is\
  \ not strictly correct.</span> <span m='1276000'>Therefore, again, you don't need\
  \ to know m minus</span> <span m='1280000'>two. You don't need to know that</span>\
  \ <span m='1283000'>subscript. Or m equal one,</span> <span m='1284000'>you don't\
  \ need to know that subscript.</span> <span m='1289000'>But for m equal zero, this\
  \ is a z squared.</span> <span m='1292000'>Absolutely. These wave functions are\
  \ linear</span> <span m='1296000'>combinations. This one is not.</span> <span m='1298000'>It\
  \ is a real function when it comes out of the Schr\u02C6dinger</span> <span m='1303000'>equation.\
  \ You will talk about these 3d</span> <span m='1307000'>wave functions a lot with\
  \ Professor Cummins in the</span> <span m='1311000'>second-half of the course. You\
  \ will actually look at the</span> <span m='1316000'>shapes of those wave functions\
  \ in detail.</span> <span m='1321000'>So, that's the energy level diagram, here.</span>\
  \ <span m='1324000'>All right. Now let's actually talk about</span> <span m='1328000'>the\
  \ shapes of the wave functions.</span> <span m='1331000'>I am going to raise this\
  \ screen, I think.</span> <span m='1345000'>What do these wave functions actually\
  \ look like?</span> <span m='1360000'>Well, for a hydrogen atom, our wave function\
  \ here,</span> <span m='1365000'>given by three quantum numbers, n, l and m, function\
  \ of r,</span> <span m='1372000'>theta and phi, it turns out that those wave</span>\
  \ <span m='1377000'>functions are factorable into a function that is only in r and\
  \ a</span> <span m='1384000'>function that is only in the angles.</span> <span m='1390000'>You\
  \ can write that, no approximation,</span> <span m='1393000'>this is just the way\
  \ it turns out.</span> <span m='1396000'>The function that is a function only of\
  \ r, R of r,</span> <span m='1402000'>is called the radial function. We will call\
  \ it capital R,</span> <span m='1407000'>radial function of r. It is labeled by\
  \ only two</span> <span m='1411000'>quantum numbers, n and l.</span> <span m='1415000'>The\
  \ function that is a function only of the angles,</span> <span m='1420000'>theta\
  \ and phi, we are going to call Y.</span> <span m='1423000'>This is the angular\
  \ part of the wave function.</span> <span m='1428000'>And it labeled by only two\
  \ quantum numbers,</span> <span m='1432000'>but they are l and m. Sometimes we call\
  \ this angular</span> <span m='1438000'>part, for short, the Y(lm)'s.</span> <span\
  \ m='1442000'>There is a radial part, and there is an angular part.</span> <span\
  \ m='1446000'>The actual functional forms are what I show you here on the side</span>\
  \ <span m='1452000'>screen. And, in this case,</span> <span m='1455000'>what I did\
  \ is to separate the radial part from the angular</span> <span m='1460000'>part.\
  \ This first part,</span> <span m='1462000'>here, is the radial part of the wave\
  \ function.</span> <span m='1468000'>And here on the right is the angular part of\
  \ the wave</span> <span m='1472000'>function. And I have written them down</span>\
  \ <span m='1475000'>for the 1s, the 2s, and the bottom one is the 3s,</span> <span\
  \ m='1479000'>although I left the label off in order to get the whole wave</span>\
  \ <span m='1484000'>function in there. I want you to notice,</span> <span m='1488000'>here,\
  \ that the angular part, the Y(lm) for the s wave</span> <span m='1492000'>functions,\
  \ it has no theta and phi in it.</span> <span m='1496000'>There is no angular dependence.\
  \ They are spherically symmetric.</span> <span m='1502000'>That is going to be different\
  \ for the p wave functions.</span> <span m='1508000'>The angular part is just one\
  \ over four pi to the one-half</span> <span m='1513000'>power. And</span> <span\
  \ m='1516000'>it is the radial part, here, that we actually are</span> <span m='1521000'>going\
  \ to take a look at right now.</span> <span m='1524000'>Let's start with that 1s\
  \ wave function, up there.</span> <span m='1530000'>If I plot that wavefunction,\
  \ this is Psi(1,</span> <span m='1533000'>0, 0), or the 1s wave function versus\
  \ r.</span> <span m='1537000'>Oh, I should tell you one other thing that I didn't\
  \ tell you.</span> <span m='1542000'>That is that throughout these wave functions,</span>\
  \ <span m='1546000'>you see this thing called a nought.</span> <span m='1550000'>a\
  \ nought is a constant. It is called the Bohr radius.</span> <span m='1554000'>I\
  \ will explain to you where that comes from in a little bit</span> <span m='1560000'>later.\
  \ But it has a value of about</span> <span m='1564000'>0.529 angstroms. That is\
  \ just a constant.</span> <span m='1568000'>Let's plot here the (1, 0, 0) wave function.</span>\
  \ <span m='1572000'>If I went and plotted it, what I would find is simply</span>\
  \ <span m='1577000'>that the wave function at r is equal to zero,</span> <span m='1582000'>here,\
  \ would start out at some high finite value,</span> <span m='1587000'>and there\
  \ would just be an exponential decay.</span> <span m='1593000'>Because if you look\
  \ here at the functional form,</span> <span m='1596000'>what do you have? Well,\
  \ you have all this stuff,</span> <span m='1600000'>but that is just a constant.\
  \ And the only thing you have is</span> <span m='1605000'>an e to the minus r over\
  \ a nought</span> <span m='1609000'>dependence. That is what gives you this</span>\
  \ <span m='1612000'>exponential drop in the wave function.</span> <span m='1617000'>What\
  \ this says is that the wave function at all values of r has</span> <span m='1624000'>a\
  \ positive value. Now, what about the Psi(2,</span> <span m='1630000'>0, 0) wave\
  \ function? Let's look at that.</span> <span m='1635000'>Psi(2,0,0), or the 2s wave\
  \ function as a function of r.</span> <span m='1642000'>What happens here? Well,\
  \ we are plotting</span> <span m='1647000'>essentially this. All of this stuff is\
  \ a</span> <span m='1652000'>constant. And we have a two minus r over</span> <span\
  \ m='1656000'>a nought times an e to the minus r over 2 a nought.</span> <span m='1661000'>That\
  \ is what we are really</span> <span m='1665000'>plotting here. And, if I did that,</span>\
  \ <span m='1668000'>it would look something like this.</span> <span m='1671000'>We\
  \ start at some large, positive value here.</span> <span m='1674000'>And you see\
  \ that the wave function decreases.</span> <span m='1680000'>And it gets to a value\
  \ of r where Psi is equal to zero.</span> <span m='1686000'>That is a radial node.\
  \ And in the case of the 2s wave</span> <span m='1692000'>function, that radial\
  \ node occurs at r equals 2 a nought.</span> <span m='1698000'>And then the wave\
  \ function</span> <span m='1702000'>becomes negative, increases, and gets more and</span>\
  \ <span m='1707000'>more negative, until you get to a point where</span> <span m='1712000'>it\
  \ starts increasing again and then approaches zero.</span> <span m='1720000'>This\
  \ part, here, of the wave function is really</span> <span m='1724000'>dictated by\
  \ the exponential term, the e to the minus r over</span> <span m='1729000'>2 a nought.\
  \ This part of the wave function</span> <span m='1734000'>is dictated by this polynomial\
  \ here, two minus r over ao.</span> <span m='1740000'>If you wanted to solve for\
  \ that</span> <span m='1744000'>radial node, what would you do? You would take that\
  \ functional</span> <span m='1749000'>form, set it equal to zero and solve for r.</span>\
  \ <span m='1752000'>And so you can see that 2 minus r over a nought set equal to</span>\
  \ <span m='1756000'>zero, that when r is 2 a nought,</span> <span m='1760000'>that\
  \ the wave function would have a value of zero.</span> <span m='1764000'>That is\
  \ how you solve for the value of r</span> <span m='1769000'>at which you have a\
  \ node. Now, this is really important</span> <span m='1774000'>here. That is, at\
  \ the radial node,</span> <span m='1777000'>the wave function changes sign. The\
  \ amplitude of the wave</span> <span m='1782000'>function goes from positive to\
  \ negative.</span> <span m='1785000'>That is important because at all nodes, for\
  \ all wave</span> <span m='1790000'>functions, the wave function changes sign.</span>\
  \ <span m='1793000'>And the reason the sign of the wave function is so important\
  \ is</span> <span m='1799000'>in chemical bonding. But let me back up for a</span>\
  \ <span m='1803000'>moment. Many of you have talked about p</span> <span m='1806000'>orbitals\
  \ or have seen p orbitals before.</span> <span m='1809000'>Sometimes on a lobe of\
  \ a p orbital, you put a plus sign and</span> <span m='1814000'>sometimes you put\
  \ a negative sign.</span> <span m='1816000'>You have seen that, right?</span> <span\
  \ m='1818000'>Okay. Well, what that is just</span> <span m='1820000'>referring to\
  \ is the sign of the amplitude of the wave function.</span> <span m='1825000'>It\
  \ means that in that area the amplitude is positive,</span> <span m='1829000'>and\
  \ in the other area the amplitude is negative.</span> <span m='1834000'>And the\
  \ reason the amplitudes are so important,</span> <span m='1837000'>or the sign of\
  \ the amplitudes are so important is because in a</span> <span m='1842000'>chemical\
  \ reaction, when you are bringing two atoms</span> <span m='1846000'>together and\
  \ your electrons that are represented by waves are</span> <span m='1851000'>overlapping,\
  \ if you are bringing in two wave functions that have</span> <span m='1856000'>the\
  \ same sign, well, then you are going to</span> <span m='1859000'>have constructive\
  \ interference. And you are going to have</span> <span m='1865000'>chemical bonding.\
  \ If you bring in two atoms,</span> <span m='1869000'>and the wave functions are\
  \ overlapping and they have</span> <span m='1874000'>opposite signs, you have destructive</span>\
  \ <span m='1877000'>interference and you are not going to have any chemical</span>\
  \ <span m='1882000'>bonding. That is why the sign of those</span> <span m='1885000'>wave\
  \ functions is so important. So, that is Psi(2,</span> <span m='1890000'>0, 0).\
  \ What about Psi(3,</span> <span m='1894000'>0, 0)? That is the last function,</span>\
  \ <span m='1898000'>here, on the side walls. And let me just write down the</span>\
  \ <span m='1905000'>radial part, 27 minus 18(r over a nought) plus 2 times (r over\
  \ a</span> <span m='1913000'>nought) quantity squared times e to the minus r over\
  \ 3 a nought.</span> <span m='1929000'>And now, if I plotted that function, Psi(3,0,0),</span>\
  \ <span m='1934000'>3s wave function, I would find out that r equals</span> <span\
  \ m='1939000'>zero, large value of psi finite, it drops, it crosses zero,</span>\
  \ <span m='1946000'>gets negative, then gets less negative,</span> <span m='1950000'>crosses\
  \ zero again, and then drops off.</span> <span m='1956000'>In the case of the 3s\
  \ wave function, we have two radial</span> <span m='1960000'>nodes. We have a radial\
  \ node right in</span> <span m='1963000'>here, and we have a radial node right in\
  \ there.</span> <span m='1967000'>And, if you want to know what those radial nodes\
  \ are,</span> <span m='1971000'>you set the wave function equal to zero and solve\
  \ for the values</span> <span m='1976000'>of r that make that wave function zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='1981000'>And, if you do that, you would find this would come</span> <span\
  \ m='1984000'>out to be, in terms of units of a nought,</span> <span m='1988000'>1.9\
  \ a nought. And right here,</span> <span m='1990000'>it would be 7.1 a nought. The\
  \ wave function,</span> <span m='1993000'>in the case of the 3s, has a positive\
  \ value for r less</span> <span m='1997000'>than 1.9 a nought,</span> <span m='2000000'>has\
  \ a negative value from 1.9 a nought to 7.1 a nought,</span> <span m='2005000'>and\
  \ then a positive value again</span> <span m='2009000'>from 7.1 a nought to infinity.</span>\
  \ <span m='2013000'>So, those are the wave</span> <span m='2017000'>functions, the\
  \ functional forms, what they actually look like.</span> <span m='2025000'>Now,\
  \ it is time to talk about what the wave function actually</span> <span m='2033000'>means,\
  \ and how does it represent the electron.</span> <span m='2052000'>Well, this was,\
  \ of course, a very puzzling</span> <span m='2056000'>question to the scientific\
  \ community.</span> <span m='2060000'>As soon as S wrote down is Schr\u02C6dinger\
  \ equation,</span> <span m='2065000'>hmm, somehow these waves represent the particles,</span>\
  \ <span m='2070000'>but exactly how do they represent where the particles</span>\
  \ <span m='2075000'>are? And the answer to that question</span> <span m='2080000'>is\
  \ essentially there is no answer to that question.</span> <span m='2086000'>Wave\
  \ functions are wave functions.</span> <span m='2090000'>It is one of these concepts\
  \ that you cannot draw a classical</span> <span m='2097000'>analogy to. You want\
  \ to say,</span> <span m='2101000'>well, a wave function does this.</span> <span\
  \ m='2105000'>But the only way you can describe it is in terms of</span> <span m='2110000'>language\
  \ that is something that you experience everyday in your</span> <span m='2117000'>world,\
  \ so you cannot. A wave function is a wave</span> <span m='2122000'>function. I\
  \ cannot draw a correct analogy</span> <span m='2126000'>to a classical world. Really,\
  \ that is the case.</span> <span m='2132000'>However, it took a very smart gentleman\
  \ by the name of Max</span> <span m='2139000'>Born to look at this problem. He said,\
  \ \"If I take the wave</span> <span m='2146000'>function and I square it, if I interpret\
  \ that as a</span> <span m='2152000'>probability density, then I can understand\
  \ all the</span> <span m='2157000'>predictions made by the Schr\u02C6dinger equation\
  \ within that</span> <span m='2164000'>framework.\" In other words,</span> <span\
  \ m='2169000'>he said, let me take Psi and l and m as a function r,</span> <span\
  \ m='2176000'>theta, and phi and square it. Let me interpret that as a</span> <span\
  \ m='2183000'>probability density.</span> <span m='2192000'>Probability density\
  \ is not a probability.</span> <span m='2196000'>It is a density. Density is always\
  \ per unit</span> <span m='2201000'>volume. Probability density is a</span> <span\
  \ m='2205000'>probability per unit volume.</span> <span m='2214000'>It is a probability\
  \ per unit volume.</span> <span m='2217000'>Well, if I use that interpretation,</span>\
  \ <span m='2220000'>then I can understand all the predictions made by the</span>\
  \ <span m='2224000'>Schr\u02C6dinger equation. It makes sense.</span> <span m='2229000'>And,\
  \ you know what, that is it.</span> <span m='2233000'>Because that interpretation\
  \ does agree with our</span> <span m='2239000'>observations, it is therefore believed\
  \ to be</span> <span m='2245000'>correct. But it is just an assumption.</span> <span\
  \ m='2252000'>It is an interpretation. There is no derivation for it.</span> <span\
  \ m='2257000'>It is just that the interpretation works.</span> <span m='2261000'>If\
  \ it works, we therefore believe it to be</span> <span m='2265000'>accurate. There\
  \ is no indication,</span> <span m='2268000'>there are no data that seem to contradict\
  \ that interpretation,</span> <span m='2274000'>so we think it is right. That is\
  \ what Max Born said.</span> <span m='2280000'>Now, Max Born was really something\
  \ in terms of his</span> <span m='2283000'>scientific accomplishments. Not only\
  \ did he recognize or</span> <span m='2288000'>have the insight to realize what\
  \ Psi squared was,</span> <span m='2292000'>but he is also the Born of the Born-Oppenheimer\
  \ Approximation</span> <span m='2296000'>that maybe some of you have heard about\
  \ before.</span> <span m='2300000'>He is also the Born in the Distorted-Wave Born</span>\
  \ <span m='2304000'>Approximation, which probably none of you have</span> <span\
  \ m='2307000'>heard before. But, despite all of those</span> <span m='2312000'>accomplishments,\
  \ psi squared interpretation,</span> <span m='2317000'>Born-Oppenheimer Approximation,\
  \ Distorted-Wave Born</span> <span m='2322000'>Approximation, he is best known for\
  \ being the</span> <span m='2326000'>grandfather of Olivia Newton-John.</span> <span\
  \ m='2330000'>That's right. Oliver Newton-John is a singer</span> <span m='2334000'>in\
  \ Grease. Two weeks ago in the Boston</span> <span m='2339000'>Globe Parade Magazine,\
  \ which I actually think is a</span> <span m='2344000'>magazine that goes throughout\
  \ the country in all the Sunday</span> <span m='2349000'>newspapers, there is a\
  \ long article on Olivia Newton-John</span> <span m='2355000'>and a short sentence\
  \ about her grandfather, Max Born.</span> <span m='2359000'>So, that is our interpretation,\
  \ thanks to Max Born.</span> <span m='2364000'>Now, how are we going to use that?</span>\
  \ <span m='2369000'>Well, first of all, let's take our functional forms</span> <span\
  \ m='2375000'>for Psi, here, and square it and plot those</span> <span m='2380000'>probability\
  \ densities for the individual wave functions and</span> <span m='2387000'>see what\
  \ we get.</span> <span m='2395000'>The way I am going to plot the probability density\
  \ is by using</span> <span m='2400000'>some dots. And the density of the dots is</span>\
  \ <span m='2404000'>going to reflect the probability density.</span> <span m='2408000'>The\
  \ more dense the dots, the larger the probability</span> <span m='2413000'>density.\
  \ If I take that functional form</span> <span m='2416000'>for the 1s wave function\
  \ and square it and then plot the</span> <span m='2421000'>value of that function\
  \ squared with this density dot diagram,</span> <span m='2427000'>then you can see\
  \ that the dots here are most dense right at the</span> <span m='2433000'>origin,\
  \ and that they exponentially decay in all</span> <span m='2437000'>directions.\
  \ The probability density here</span> <span m='2441000'>for 1s wave function is\
  \ greatest at the origin,</span> <span m='2445000'>r equals 0, and it decays exponentially\
  \ in all directions.</span> <span m='2448000'>It is spherically symmetric. That\
  \ is what you would expect</span> <span m='2452000'>because that is what the wave\
  \ function looks like.</span> <span m='2456000'>You square that, you get another\
  \ exponential,</span> <span m='2459000'>and it decays exponentially in all directions.</span>\
  \ <span m='2463000'>That is a probability density, probability of finding the</span>\
  \ <span m='2468000'>electron per unit volume at some value r, theta,</span> <span\
  \ m='2472000'>and phi. And it turns out it doesn't</span> <span m='2475000'>matter\
  \ what theta and phi are because this is spherically</span> <span m='2480000'>symmetric.\
  \ What about the 2s wave</span> <span m='2483000'>function? Well, here is the 2s</span>\
  \ <span m='2486000'>probability density. Again, you can see the</span> <span m='2490000'>probability\
  \ density is a maximum at the origin,</span> <span m='2494000'>at the nucleus. That\
  \ probability density decays</span> <span m='2497000'>uniformly in all directions.\
  \ And it decays so much that at</span> <span m='2501000'>some point, you have no\
  \ probability density.</span> <span m='2505000'>Why? Because that is the node.</span>\
  \ <span m='2507000'>If you square zero, you still get zero.</span> <span m='2510000'>r\
  \ equals 2 a nought.</span> <span m='2512000'>You can see that in the probability\
  \ density.</span> <span m='2517000'>But then again, as you move up this way,</span>\
  \ <span m='2520000'>as you increase r, the probability density</span> <span m='2523000'>increases\
  \ again. Why?</span> <span m='2524000'>Remember the wave function? It has changed\
  \ sign.</span> <span m='2528000'>But in this area, here, where it is negative,</span>\
  \ <span m='2531000'>if I square it, well, the probability density</span> <span m='2535000'>still\
  \ is going to be large. Square a negative number,</span> <span m='2539000'>you are\
  \ going to have a large positive number.</span> <span m='2542000'>That is why the\
  \ probability density increases right in here,</span> <span m='2547000'>and then,\
  \ again, it decays towards zero.</span> <span m='2552000'>You can see the radial\
  \ node not only in the wave function,</span> <span m='2557000'>but also in the probability\
  \ density.</span> <span m='2561000'>Here is the probability density for the 3s wave\
  \ function.</span> <span m='2567000'>Once again, probability density is a maximum\
  \ at r equals 0,</span> <span m='2572000'>and it decays uniformly in all directions.</span>\
  \ <span m='2578000'>It decays so much that at some value of r, right here,</span>\
  \ <span m='2581000'>the probability density is zero.</span> <span m='2583000'>Why?\
  \ Because the wave function is</span> <span m='2585000'>zero. You square it,</span>\
  \ <span m='2587000'>and you are going to get a zero for the probability density.</span>\
  \ <span m='2591000'>And then the probability density increases again.</span> <span\
  \ m='2594000'>Why? Because you are getting a more</span> <span m='2596000'>and more\
  \ negative value for the wave function right in this</span> <span m='2600000'>area.\
  \ Square that,</span> <span m='2601000'>and it is going to increase. And then, as\
  \ you continue to</span> <span m='2605000'>increase r, probability density decreases.</span>\
  \ <span m='2610000'>It decreases again, so that you get a zero.</span> <span m='2613000'>You\
  \ get a zero because the wave function is zero right there.</span> <span m='2617000'>This\
  \ is our second radial node. But then, the probability</span> <span m='2621000'>density\
  \ increases again. It increases because the wave</span> <span m='2625000'>function\
  \ increases. Square that,</span> <span m='2628000'>we are going to get a high probability\
  \ density,</span> <span m='2631000'>and then it tapers off. So, the important point\
  \ here is</span> <span m='2635000'>the interpretation of the probability density.</span>\
  \ <span m='2640000'>Probability per unit volume. The fact that the s wave</span>\
  \ <span m='2645000'>functions are all spherically symmetric.</span> <span m='2648000'>They\
  \ do not have an angular dependence to them.</span> <span m='2653000'>And what a\
  \ radial node is. If you want to get a radial</span> <span m='2658000'>node, you\
  \ take the wave function, set it equal to zero,</span> <span m='2663000'>solve for\
  \ the value of r, and that gives you a zero.</span> <span m='2670000'>Now, so far,\
  \ we have talked only about the</span> <span m='2674000'>probability density and\
  \ this interpretation.</span> <span m='2678000'>We have not talked about any probabilities\
  \ yet.</span> <span m='2683000'>And, to do so, we are going to talk about this</span>\
  \ <span m='2688000'>function, here. It is called a radial</span> <span m='2692000'>probability\
  \ distribution. The radial probability</span> <span m='2698000'>distribution is\
  \ the probability of finding an electron in a</span> <span m='2704000'>spherical\
  \ shell. That spherical shell will be</span> <span m='2708000'>some distance r away\
  \ from the nucleus.</span> <span m='2712000'>That spherical shell will have a radius\
  \ r and will have a</span> <span m='2718000'>thickness. And the thickness,</span>\
  \ <span m='2720000'>we are going to call dr. This is not a solid sphere.</span>\
  \ <span m='2726000'>This is a shell. This is a sphere,</span> <span m='2730000'>but\
  \ the thickness of that sphere is very small.</span> <span m='2735000'>The thickness\
  \ of it is dr. And, to try to represent that a</span> <span m='2741000'>little bit\
  \ better, I show you here a picture of</span> <span m='2745000'>the probability\
  \ density for the (1, 0, 0) state.</span> <span m='2750000'>This is kind of my density\
  \ dot diagram.</span> <span m='2754000'>And then, this blue thing is my spherical\
  \ shell.</span> <span m='2760000'>This blue thing, here, has a radius r,</span>\
  \ <span m='2764000'>and this blue thing has a thickness dr.</span> <span m='2768000'>And\
  \ so, I am saying that the radial probability distribution</span> <span m='2774000'>is\
  \ going to be the probability of finding the electron in this</span> <span m='2781000'>spherical\
  \ shell. That spherical shell is a</span> <span m='2786000'>distance r from the\
  \ nucleus and has a thickness dr.</span> <span m='2793000'>Now, I want to point\
  \ out that the volume of the spherical</span> <span m='2797000'>shell is just the\
  \ surface area, here, 4 pi r squared,</span> <span m='2801000'>times the thickness,\
  \ which is dr.</span> <span m='2804000'>Not a very thick spherical</span> <span\
  \ m='2809000'>shell. The radial probability</span> <span m='2811000'>distribution\
  \ is the probability of finding that electron in that</span> <span m='2816000'>spherical\
  \ shell. It is like the probability of</span> <span m='2822000'>finding the electron\
  \ a distance r to r plus dr</span> <span m='2830000'>from the nucleus. Why is that\
  \ important?</span> <span m='2834000'>Well, because if I want to calculate a probability,</span>\
  \ <span m='2841000'>what I can do then is take the probability density here,</span>\
  \ <span m='2847000'>Psi squared for an s orbital, which is probability per unit</span>\
  \ <span m='2854000'>volume, and I can then multiply it by that unit volume.</span>\
  \ <span m='2863000'>In this case it was the 4pi r squared dr.</span> <span m='2868000'>And\
  \ the result will be a probability, because I have</span> <span m='2873000'>probability\
  \ density, probability per unit volume</span> <span m='2877000'>times a volume,\
  \ and that is a probability.</span> <span m='2882000'>Now we are getting somewhere\
  \ in terms of figuring out what the</span> <span m='2889000'>probability is of finding\
  \ the electron some distance r to r</span> <span m='2895000'>plus dr from the nucleus.\
  \ In the case of the s orbitals,</span> <span m='2902000'>I said that the Psi was\
  \ a product of the radial part and</span> <span m='2908000'>the Y(lm) angular part.\
  \ Remember that the Y(lm) for the</span> <span m='2914000'>s orbitals was always\
  \ one over the square-root of one over 4pi.</span> <span m='2920000'>The Y(lm) squared\
  \ is going to</span> <span m='2926000'>cancel with 4pi, and you are just going to\
  \ have</span> <span m='2930000'>r squared times the radial part squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='2934000'>For a 1s orbital, if you want to actually</span> <span m='2937000'>calculate\
  \ the probability at some value r,</span> <span m='2941000'>you just have to take\
  \ Psi squared and multiply it by 4pi r</span> <span m='2947000'>squared dr.</span>\
  \ <span m='2952000'>However, in the case of all other orbitals,</span> <span m='2956000'>you\
  \ cannot do that because they are not spherically symmetric.</span> <span m='2962000'>And\
  \ so, for all other orbitals, you have to take the radial</span> <span m='2968000'>part\
  \ and multiply it by r squared dr.</span> <span m='2974000'>I will explain that\
  \ a little bit more next time.</span> <span m='2978000'>Okay. See you on Monday.</span>\
