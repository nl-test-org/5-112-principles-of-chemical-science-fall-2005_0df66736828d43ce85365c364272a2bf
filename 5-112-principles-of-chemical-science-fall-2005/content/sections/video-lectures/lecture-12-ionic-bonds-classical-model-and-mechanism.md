  \ information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in\
  \ general is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='15000'>Last time we were\
  \ talking about the general interactions that</span> <span m='21000'>are present\
  \ in a chemical bond. And we were,</span> <span m='25000'>in particular, looking\
  \ at the energy of</span> <span m='29000'>interaction, here, as we brought two hydrogen</span>\
  \ <span m='34000'>atoms together. We were looking at that energy</span> <span m='40000'>of\
  \ interaction as a function of the distance r between these two</span> <span m='48000'>nuclei.\
  \ And we saw, of course,</span> <span m='51000'>way out here, that the energy of\
  \ interaction</span> <span m='56000'>was minus 2,624 kilojoules per mole.</span>\
  \ <span m='62000'>As we brought the two hydrogen atoms in closer together,</span>\
  \ <span m='66000'>that interaction energy went down.</span> <span m='68000'>It became\
  \ a maximum negative value at some r.</span> <span m='72000'>That r is the equilibrium\
  \ bond length.</span> <span m='75000'>And then, as you try to push the two nuclei\
  \ closer together,</span> <span m='79000'>the energy of interaction goes up again,\
  \ so far up that when</span> <span m='84000'>you get them really close, the energy\
  \ of interaction is</span> <span m='88000'>greater than that of the two separated\
  \ hydrogen atoms.</span> <span m='94000'>And so, in this region, the hydrogen atoms\
  \ are no</span> <span m='97000'>longer bound. Wherever this energy is lower</span>\
  \ <span m='101000'>than that of the separated hydrogen atom limit you have a</span>\
  \ <span m='105000'>bound molecule. This was the attractive part of</span> <span\
  \ m='109000'>the potential. This was the well depth or the</span> <span m='112000'>bond\
  \ association energy, measured from here to here.</span> <span m='116000'>That is\
  \ how much energy you would have to put in to pull the</span> <span m='121000'>two\
  \ hydrogens apart. This is the repulsive region of</span> <span m='128000'>that\
  \ interaction potential. We were talking about how that</span> <span m='135000'>curve,\
  \ that energy, was really the sum of three</span> <span m='142000'>components. That\
  \ energy of interaction was</span> <span m='147000'>the sum of the nuclear-nuclear\
  \ repulsion.</span> <span m='154000'>That is, the repulsion between the nucleus\
  \ of this hydrogen and</span> <span m='160000'>the nucleus of that hydrogen. In\
  \ addition to that</span> <span m='165000'>nuclear-nuclear repulsion, there is the\
  \ electron-nuclear</span> <span m='170000'>attraction. The electron-nuclear</span>\
  \ <span m='173000'>attraction, between the electron on the original nucleus and,</span>\
  \ <span m='179000'>when the two hydrogens get close enough,</span> <span m='183000'>the\
  \ electron attraction between the other nucleus.</span> <span m='190000'>And then,\
  \ finally, there is the electron-electron</span> <span m='194000'>repulsion. When\
  \ these two hydrogen atoms</span> <span m='197000'>come so close, the electrons\
  \ now are going to</span> <span m='201000'>repel. And so, this curve is actually</span>\
  \ <span m='204000'>the sum of those three contributions.</span> <span m='209000'>And\
  \ what we were trying to do last time is to look at the</span> <span m='214000'>dependence\
  \ of these interactions,</span> <span m='217000'>individually, on r.</span> <span\
  \ m='219000'>And then we wanted to sum them up to see why we actually have</span>\
  \ <span m='225000'>the shape of this interaction potential that we do.</span> <span\
  \ m='231000'>We are trying to decompose this.</span> <span m='234000'>We are trying\
  \ to understand over what regions of r,</span> <span m='239000'>which one of these\
  \ interaction energies is dominant.</span> <span m='246000'>That is what we are\
  \ doing. And I think last time we</span> <span m='250000'>started in the sense that\
  \ we recognized what the r dependence</span> <span m='256000'>was for the nuclear-nuclear\
  \ repulsion.</span> <span m='259000'>The nuclear-nuclear repulsion is just the Coulomb\
  \ interaction</span> <span m='265000'>energy between two like positive charges.</span>\
  \ <span m='270000'>That nuclear-nuclear repulsion was e squared over 4 pi epsilon</span>\
  \ <span m='275000'>nought times r.</span> <span m='280000'>And so that component\
  \ I could easily draw.</span> <span m='284000'>And I did draw it last time, I think.</span>\
  \ <span m='287000'>This is one over r dependence.</span> <span m='291000'>This is\
  \ the e squared over 4 pi epsilon nought r.</span> <span m='305000'>That was one\
  \ of them. Now, next, these two terms are</span> <span m='311000'>what I am going\
  \ to call the electron interactions because</span> <span m='317000'>both of them\
  \ involve the electron.</span> <span m='321000'>This one did not. This was just\
  \ the nucleus.</span> <span m='328000'>It turns out that I don't have a nice simple\
  \ way to tell you</span> <span m='333000'>what the r dependence between the nuclei\
  \ will be for the</span> <span m='337000'>electron-nuclear attraction, nor do I\
  \ have a nice simple way</span> <span m='342000'>to figure out what the r dependence\
  \ will be for the</span> <span m='347000'>electron-electron repulsion. I cannot\
  \ do that without</span> <span m='351000'>actually solving the Schr\u02C6dinger\
  \ equation.</span> <span m='355000'>I don't have a simple way to break that down.</span>\
  \ <span m='360000'>However, what I can do is I can estimate what the sum of these</span>\
  \ <span m='368000'>electron interactions are at two extremes.</span> <span m='374000'>Is\
  \ this noisy? Can you hear me?</span> <span m='379000'>I can see why it is noisy.</span>\
  \ <span m='403000'>I do know what it is at two extremes.</span> <span m='406000'>I\
  \ know what those sums of those interactions are for very large</span> <span m='411000'>r,\
  \ and I know what it is for r equals 0.</span> <span m='415000'>What I am going\
  \ to do is calculate it for r equals</span> <span m='420000'>infinity and r equals\
  \ 0. And I am going to then put it</span> <span m='425000'>on this plot. And then\
  \ to just estimate what</span> <span m='429000'>the r dependence is, I am going\
  \ to draw a line from</span> <span m='433000'>that point to that point. That is\
  \ the best I can do.</span> <span m='438000'>Let's do that.</span> <span m='447000'>Let\
  \ me start with this energy of interaction at r equals</span> <span m='453000'>infinity.\
  \ I want to evaluate what the</span> <span m='457000'>repulsive interaction is between\
  \ the electrons at r equals</span> <span m='462000'>infinity. What is that interaction</span>\
  \ <span m='465000'>energy? It is zero because the</span> <span m='467000'>electrons\
  \ are so far apart at r equals infinity that there is no</span> <span m='473000'>interaction\
  \ energy. It is the repulsive</span> <span m='476000'>interaction. It is this kind\
  \ of interaction,</span> <span m='480000'>r equals infinity. That is going to be\
  \ zero.</span> <span m='485000'>But now this term, this electron-nuclear</span>\
  \ <span m='490000'>attraction. When the two hydrogen atoms</span> <span m='494000'>here\
  \ are very far apart, what is the energy of the</span> <span m='500000'>electron-nuclear\
  \ attraction there?</span> <span m='504000'>I cannot hear you, so I will tell you.</span>\
  \ <span m='510000'>It is the binding energy of a 1s electron.</span> <span m='514000'>I\
  \ mean that is the energy of interaction.</span> <span m='518000'>When r is very\
  \ large, when r is infinity,</span> <span m='522000'>the energy of interaction is\
  \ just the 1s binding energy of</span> <span m='527000'>the electron to each of\
  \ its nuclei.</span> <span m='531000'>The energy of interaction, the electron-nuclear\
  \ attraction</span> <span m='536000'>is just E sub 1s for this one.</span> <span\
  \ m='542000'>And e sub 1s for that one.</span> <span m='545000'>In a hydrogen atom\
  \ that is what it is.</span> <span m='549000'>It is the electron-nuclear attraction.</span>\
  \ <span m='552000'>And so, right here, this is equal to 2 times E sub</span> <span\
  \ m='557000'>1s.</span> <span m='570000'>Now, you know that E sub 1s is equal to\
  \ minus</span> <span m='576000'>2.18x10^-18 joules, but in kilojoules per mole,</span>\
  \ <span m='581000'>that is equal to minus 1 kilojoules per mole.</span> <span m='587000'>And,\
  \ if we have two of them, as we do, 2 times E sub 1s</span> <span m='594000'>is\
  \ minus 2 kilojoules per mole.</span> <span m='599000'>I calculated what the electron</span>\
  \ <span m='608000'>interaction energy is at r is equal to infinity.</span> <span\
  \ m='614000'>That is way out here. This is hydrogen plus hydrogen.</span> <span\
  \ m='621000'>This is minus 2,624, the same number I got over</span> <span m='628000'>there.\
  \ Now, what we have to do --</span> <span m='642000'>-- is calculate what that energy\
  \ of interaction is at r is</span> <span m='647000'>equal to 0. When r is equal\
  \ to 0,</span> <span m='650000'>we have two hydrogen atoms right on top of each\
  \ other.</span> <span m='655000'>We have two hydrogen nuclei right on top of each\
  \ other.</span> <span m='662000'>That means, in our kind of thought experiment here,</span>\
  \ <span m='666000'>that the charge on the nucleus is Z equals 2.</span> <span m='670000'>That\
  \ means when the two hydrogen atoms are right on top</span> <span m='675000'>of\
  \ each other, it looks like we have a helium</span> <span m='678000'>nucleus. And\
  \ there is electron number</span> <span m='682000'>one around it and electron number\
  \ two around it.</span> <span m='686000'>That looks like a helium atom. What is\
  \ the total electron</span> <span m='692000'>interaction in the case of a helium\
  \ atom?</span> <span m='696000'>What is the total energy of interaction there?</span>\
  \ <span m='701000'>Well, the total energy of interaction is going to be minus</span>\
  \ <span m='707000'>the first ionization energy, this is going to be the energy</span>\
  \ <span m='713000'>of interaction of the helium, for a helium atom.</span> <span\
  \ m='720000'>Because minus the first ionization energy of the helium</span> <span\
  \ m='725000'>atom is the binding energy of the first electron to the helium</span>\
  \ <span m='732000'>plus minus the second ionization energy of the helium atom.</span>\
  \ <span m='738000'>In other words, if I hid this one away,</span> <span m='742000'>then\
  \ the electron-nuclear attraction between the helium</span> <span m='747000'>nucleus\
  \ in electron two is just minus the second ionization</span> <span m='753000'>energy\
  \ of helium. Does that make sense?</span> <span m='764000'>You are too hot to think.\
  \ Okay.</span> <span m='767000'>That is what that is. And if you look them up,</span>\
  \ <span m='772000'>the total energy of interaction is minus 7,622 kilojoules per</span>\
  \ <span m='779000'>mole.</span> <span m='786000'>I can plot that on this graph at\
  \ r equals 0.</span> <span m='790000'>I have minus 7,622 kilojoules. Now, I have\
  \ two points.</span> <span m='795000'>I have a point over here and a point over\
  \ there.</span> <span m='800000'>I am going to draw a straight line between the\
  \ two.</span> <span m='805000'>To get my total energy of interaction, I am going\
  \ to add</span> <span m='811000'>this curve to that curve. And when I do that,</span>\
  \ <span m='817000'>we are going to get something that looks like that.</span> <span\
  \ m='824000'>The bottom line is that this shape here is determined by the</span>\
  \ <span m='832000'>competition between the electron interactions,</span> <span m='838000'>which\
  \ are always attractive. They are always negative.</span> <span m='845000'>The electron\
  \ interactions are actually the sum of an</span> <span m='849000'>attractive term\
  \ and a repulsive term, but the repulsive term is</span> <span m='854000'>not so\
  \ repulsive as to overcome the attractive term.</span> <span m='858000'>It is always\
  \ negative. Overall, the sum is still</span> <span m='862000'>attractive. The electron\
  \ interactions are</span> <span m='865000'>attractive. This particular curve is\
  \ the</span> <span m='868000'>competition between the electron interactions,</span>\
  \ <span m='872000'>those attractive interactions and the nuclear interactions,</span>\
  \ <span m='876000'>which are repulsive. In other words,</span> <span m='881000'>you\
  \ have to get the two hydrogen atoms close enough in</span> <span m='885000'>order\
  \ for the attractive interactions to take hold.</span> <span m='890000'>But you\
  \ cannot get them so close because if you get them</span> <span m='895000'>too close,\
  \ the nuclear-nuclear repulsions set in.</span> <span m='900000'>Where your chemical\
  \ bond length is, is determined by that</span> <span m='905000'>competition between\
  \ the electron attractive interactions and</span> <span m='911000'>those nuclear-nuclear\
  \ repulsions.</span> <span m='914000'>That is what determines the bond length.</span>\
  \ <span m='918000'>That is fundamentally, here, what determines the bond</span>\
  \ <span m='923000'>strength, the competition between these overall attractive</span>\
  \ <span m='929000'>interactions due to the electrons and the</span> <span m='933000'>nuclear-nuclear\
  \ repulsion. That was the concept,</span> <span m='939000'>really, that I wanted\
  \ to get across here, those fundamental</span> <span m='944000'>interactions that\
  \ make up this kind of curve.</span> <span m='949000'>You are going to see this\
  \ curve a lot.</span> <span m='953000'>All chemical bonds have this kind of dependence\
  \ on r,</span> <span m='958000'>energy of interaction on r. There is one other point\
  \ I want</span> <span m='965000'>to make. That is that what we often and</span>\
  \ <span m='969000'>usually do is we reset our zero of energy.</span> <span m='974000'>Another\
  \ words, we are going to reset our zero</span> <span m='979000'>of energy, here,\
  \ so that the zero of energy</span> <span m='984000'>corresponds to the separated\
  \ atom limit.</span> <span m='990000'>Why do we do that? Well, because this energy</span>\
  \ <span m='995000'>difference, the minus 2,624, was really the attractive</span>\
  \ <span m='1001000'>interaction between the electron and its nucleus.</span> <span\
  \ m='1007000'>It did not have anything to do with the attraction or repulsion</span>\
  \ <span m='1014000'>between the two atoms. And so, when we want to talk</span> <span\
  \ m='1020000'>only about the chemical bond and the energy changes when we make</span>\
  \ <span m='1025000'>a chemical bond, it is often useful to shift our</span> <span\
  \ m='1029000'>zero of energy down, so that the separated atom</span> <span m='1033000'>limit\
  \ is our zero of energy. And now, everything that is</span> <span m='1038000'>negative\
  \ relative to that is a bound interaction.</span> <span m='1042000'>When it gets\
  \ too close, it will be a positive</span> <span m='1046000'>interaction and the\
  \ atoms are no longer bound.</span> <span m='1051000'>I mean, we are not forgetting\
  \ about this energy here.</span> <span m='1056000'>We know if you are calculating\
  \ the total energy,</span> <span m='1060000'>it has to be there, but oftentimes\
  \ we just want to</span> <span m='1065000'>talk about the relative changes of the\
  \ energy of interaction as</span> <span m='1071000'>a function of r when we are\
  \ concerned only with forming a</span> <span m='1076000'>bond. Make sense?</span>\
  \ <span m='1078000'>Okay. That is the general phenomenon.</span> <span m='1102000'>Now,\
  \ what I want to talk about is one very simple model for an</span> <span m='1111000'>ionic\
  \ bond. This is a classical model.</span> <span m='1116000'>And the amazing thing\
  \ about it is that this simple classical</span> <span m='1122000'>model does give\
  \ us insight into the mechanism by which this bond</span> <span m='1130000'>is formed.\
  \ It is a mechanism that is only</span> <span m='1134000'>going to work when you\
  \ form a very ionic bond.</span> <span m='1141000'>This is particular for a very\
  \ ionic bond.</span> <span m='1145000'>We want to take a look at this mechanism\
  \ because it is going to</span> <span m='1152000'>give us some insight into how\
  \ the bond is actually formed.</span> <span m='1159000'>We are going to look at\
  \ the formation of sodium chloride,</span> <span m='1165000'>here. We have a sodium\
  \ atom and a</span> <span m='1170000'>chlorine atom, and they are coming together,</span>\
  \ <span m='1175000'>moving toward each other. What happens is that at a</span> <span\
  \ m='1182000'>certain distance from each other, the sodium atom,</span> <span m='1187000'>believe\
  \ it or not, actually ejects an electron.</span> <span m='1191000'>And that electron\
  \ hooks onto the chlorine.</span> <span m='1195000'>When it does that, of course\
  \ the chlorine now</span> <span m='1200000'>becomes bigger than the sodium, but\
  \ now we have two charges</span> <span m='1205000'>separated. A positive and a negative\
  \ ion.</span> <span m='1210000'>And there is a large attractive interaction between\
  \ those two.</span> <span m='1217000'>What happens is these two ions are attracted\
  \ in to each other.</span> <span m='1223000'>They are just roped right in. It is\
  \ called the Harpoon</span> <span m='1228000'>Mechanism. Why does the sodium and\
  \ the</span> <span m='1232000'>chlorine just pull right into each other?</span>\
  \ <span m='1236000'>Well, because of that rope. That rope is that Coulomb</span>\
  \ <span m='1241000'>interaction. This really happens.</span> <span m='1244000'>At\
  \ some distance the sodium atom ejects that electron,</span> <span m='1249000'>and\
  \ then that sodium just pulls that chlorine right into it</span> <span m='1254000'>until\
  \ it gets close enough to form a chemical bond,</span> <span m='1259000'>-- and\
  \ you have sodium chloride.</span> <span m='1263000'>This is a reaction mechanism\
  \ that was elucidated many years</span> <span m='1268000'>ago, called the harpoon\
  \ mechanicism.</span> <span m='1271000'>It is a mechanics elucidated by Dudley Herschbach,</span>\
  \ <span m='1275000'>who is here at Harvard in the Chemistry Department,</span> <span\
  \ m='1279000'>who has since retired. John Polanyi,</span> <span m='1282000'>who\
  \ is at Toronto, and Yuan Lee,</span> <span m='1285000'>who was at Berkeley, for\
  \ most of his career.</span> <span m='1290000'>They received the Nobel Prize for\
  \ this discovery of this</span> <span m='1294000'>mechanism, and many other kinds\
  \ of mechanism and dynamics of</span> <span m='1300000'>chemical reactions. Yuan\
  \ Lee right here,</span> <span m='1303000'>this gentleman was actually my Ph.D.</span>\
  \ <span m='1306000'>thesis supervisor at Berkeley.</span> <span m='1320000'>This\
  \ is a simple picture, and this is exactly what is</span> <span m='1324000'>going\
  \ on. This seems a little strange to</span> <span m='1328000'>you, so let's try\
  \ to understand exactly how this is working.</span> <span m='1334000'>To understand\
  \ this, what we are going to have to do</span> <span m='1339000'>is look at the\
  \ energetics of the system.</span> <span m='1342000'>And now I am going to raise\
  \ this screen here,</span> <span m='1347000'>I think. No, I don't want to.</span>\
  \ <span m='1351000'>I am going to raise it a little bit.</span> <span m='1352000'>How\
  \ is that?</span> <span m='1380000'>All right. What we are seeing is this gas</span>\
  \ <span m='1384000'>phase sodium atom ejecting an electron to form this gas phase</span>\
  \ <span m='1390000'>sodium ion, plus this electron. And of course,</span> <span\
  \ m='1395000'>that is going to cost energy. The energy change is the</span> <span\
  \ m='1401000'>ionization energy, which for sodium is</span> <span m='1405000'>kilojoules\
  \ per mole. But, at the same time,</span> <span m='1411000'>that electron is being\
  \ caught by the chlorine.</span> <span m='1415000'>And when a chlorine and an electron\
  \ recombine to form the</span> <span m='1420000'>Cl minus gas phase, there is an\
  \ energy</span> <span m='1425000'>release, as we saw. That energy release is minus</span>\
  \ <span m='1429000'>the electron affinity of chlorine.</span> <span m='1432000'>That\
  \ is equal to minus kilojoules per mole.</span> <span m='1436000'>Overall, going\
  \ from a gas phase</span> <span m='1442000'>sodium atom plus a gas phase chlorine\
  \ atom</span> <span m='1448000'>to a gas phase sodium ion and a gas phase</span>\
  \ <span m='1453000'>chlorine ion, the overall energy change here,</span> <span m='1459000'>which\
  \ is now the ionization energy minus the electron</span> <span m='1464000'>affinity,\
  \ that overal energy change is 147 kilojoules per</span> <span m='1469000'>mole.\
  \ Although we get some energy</span> <span m='1473000'>back when that electron attaches\
  \ to the chlorine,</span> <span m='1478000'>we don't get enough energy back to compensate\
  \ for having to pull</span> <span m='1484000'>the electron off of the sodium. Right\
  \ now, this still looks</span> <span m='1489000'>like an overall endothermic reaction.</span>\
  \ <span m='1493000'>We have to put 147 kilojoules into the system to make it go.</span>\
  \ <span m='1500000'>It is beginning to seem a little peculiar.</span> <span m='1505000'>How\
  \ does this work? Well, we have to remember that</span> <span m='1511000'>once we\
  \ make that sodium plus and the chlorine minus,</span> <span m='1517000'>that there\
  \ is that Coulomb interaction.</span> <span m='1523000'>The Coulomb interaction,\
  \ bringing the sodium ion plus</span> <span m='1528000'>the chlorine ion together\
  \ to make the sodium chloride,</span> <span m='1533000'>that delta E,</span> <span\
  \ m='1537000'>if I take two ions, sodium and chlorine,</span> <span m='1541000'>in\
  \ from infinity and bring them together at the bond length,</span> <span m='1546000'>that\
  \ energy change is minus kilojoules per mole.</span> <span m='1551000'>If I add\
  \ up all three reactions to get sodium gas plus chlorine</span> <span m='1557000'>gas\
  \ to make sodium chloride in the gas phase,</span> <span m='1563000'>the overall\
  \ energy change there</span> <span m='1568000'>is minus 445 kilojoules per mole.</span>\
  \ <span m='1573000'>And, of course, the reaction is downhill.</span> <span m='1577000'>But\
  \ that still doesn't give you a really good feeling for what</span> <span m='1583000'>is\
  \ really going on here. To do that, let's look at an</span> <span m='1588000'>energy\
  \ level diagram. You want to kill the front</span> <span m='1593000'>lights. This\
  \ is going to be back and</span> <span m='1596000'>forth here. All right.</span>\
  \ <span m='1598000'>What have I draw here? I have drawn the energy of</span> <span\
  \ m='1602000'>interaction between a sodium atom and a chlorine atom,</span> <span\
  \ m='1607000'>just like I did for hydrogen. I said all chemical bonds have</span>\
  \ <span m='1613000'>this same shape of energy of interaction.</span> <span m='1616000'>Here\
  \ is the bond length. 2.36 angstroms.</span> <span m='1621000'>Here is the well\
  \ depth or the dissociation energy.</span> <span m='1626000'>In this case, I show\
  \ it measured from here to</span> <span m='1631000'>there. It is minus delta E sub\
  \ d,</span> <span m='1634000'>minus 445.</span> <span m='1636000'>Here I set the\
  \ zero of energy at the separated atom limit,</span> <span m='1642000'>sodium plus\
  \ chlorine. When sodium and chlorine are</span> <span m='1648000'>way out here,\
  \ when r is really large,</span> <span m='1651000'>we saw that it is going to take\
  \ 147 kilojoules to make a sodium</span> <span m='1657000'>ion from sodium and a\
  \ chlorine ion from chlorine.</span> <span m='1661000'>That is what I calculated,\
  \ right here.</span> <span m='1665000'>If the two are far apart, if you pull an\
  \ electron off a</span> <span m='1670000'>sodium and put it onto chlorine, it is\
  \ still going to require</span> <span m='1675000'>energy, 147 kilojoules per mole.\
  \ However, I also said that when</span> <span m='1683000'>the sodium and the chlorine\
  \ come close enough,</span> <span m='1688000'>the ions are pulled in close enough\
  \ such that they can form a</span> <span m='1695000'>chemical bond, the energy you\
  \ get back is</span> <span m='1700000'>kilojoules per mole. On this diagram,</span>\
  \ <span m='1704000'>where is that? Well, that is this energy.</span> <span m='1710000'>From\
  \ up here to down there is 592 kilojoules per mole.</span> <span m='1716000'>Where\
  \ did I get that number, 592 kilojoules per mole?</span> <span m='1722000'>Well,\
  \ I calculated it using the Coulomb potential energy of</span> <span m='1730000'>interaction,\
  \ which I am calling, here, U of r sub E</span> <span m='1737000'>at this value\
  \ of r. The Coulomb potential energy of</span> <span m='1743000'>interaction is\
  \ right here for a point charge.</span> <span m='1747000'>If you treat the sodium\
  \ as a plus one charge and you treat</span> <span m='1752000'>the chlorine as a\
  \ minus one charge.</span> <span m='1755000'>All of a sudden, we are forgetting\
  \ everything</span> <span m='1759000'>about the other electrons. We are just treating\
  \ sodium ion</span> <span m='1764000'>and chlorine ion as two point charges.</span>\
  \ <span m='1769000'>If you forget completely about the other electrons and just</span>\
  \ <span m='1774000'>treat them as point charges, that is the interaction energy</span>\
  \ <span m='1780000'>right here. That 592 comes from taking that</span> <span m='1784000'>expression\
  \ and plugging in 2.36 angstroms.</span> <span m='1788000'>That is how much energy\
  \ you get back.</span> <span m='1791000'>Now we understand the energies a little\
  \ bit,</span> <span m='1795000'>but we still don't understand exactly how this electron\
  \ jump</span> <span m='1801000'>process is happening. Because the way I have it</span>\
  \ <span m='1807000'>drawn, here, it still looks like we have an electron jumping\
  \ from</span> <span m='1813000'>sodium to chlorine way out here. And we have to\
  \ put in</span> <span m='1819000'>kilojoules before we get any energy back.</span>\
  \ <span m='1823000'>Well, that is not the case. And that is not the case</span>\
  \ <span m='1828000'>because of this. This blue curve,</span> <span m='1832000'>here,\
  \ is just the Coulomb energy of interaction.</span> <span m='1836000'>We evaluated\
  \ that point, that number,</span> <span m='1840000'>from here to here using this\
  \ expression.</span> <span m='1843000'>But you know that this is a minus one over\
  \ r</span> <span m='1848000'>dependence. If you are way up here and you</span> <span\
  \ m='1852000'>treat this as a zero of energy for a plus charge and a minus</span>\
  \ <span m='1857000'>charge, one over r kind of looks like this.</span> <span m='1863000'>That\
  \ is the blue curve. But you also notice that right</span> <span m='1869000'>here,\
  \ you see that that Coulomb interaction is intersecting with</span> <span m='1877000'>this\
  \ interaction potential between a neutral sodium atom</span> <span m='1884000'>and\
  \ a neutral chlorine atom, right in there.</span> <span m='1891000'>Right at this\
  \ value of r, which we are going to call r</span> <span m='1897000'>star, the potential\
  \ energy of interaction from here to here is</span> <span m='1904000'>equal to the\
  \ sum of this ionization energy minus the</span> <span m='1910000'>electron affinity.\
  \ Right here, the electron can</span> <span m='1915000'>jump without having to put\
  \ any energy into the system.</span> <span m='1923000'>You are close enough for\
  \ the electron to jump because that</span> <span m='1929000'>Coulomb interaction\
  \ has gotten lower, and it is right at that</span> <span m='1935000'>point when\
  \ you can have that electron transfer and not have</span> <span m='1941000'>to put\
  \ any energy into the system to get it to go.</span> <span m='1946000'>In other\
  \ words, right here, the energy from</span> <span m='1951000'>right there to this\
  \ point is minus e squared 4 pi epsilon</span> <span m='1957000'>nought r star.</span>\
  \ <span m='1964000'>That energy right at that point is equal to, if I am measuring</span>\
  \ <span m='1969000'>here from the top minus the quantity ionization energy of</span>\
  \ <span m='1973000'>sodium minus the electron affinity of chlorine.</span> <span\
  \ m='1978000'>In order to solve for this</span> <span m='1982000'>distance r at\
  \ which the electron jumps, for which that electron</span> <span m='1987000'>jump\
  \ is energetically allowed, I am going to set this equal to</span> <span m='1993000'>this.\
  \ I know what the ionization</span> <span m='1996000'>energy and the electron affinity\
  \ of sodium and chlorine are.</span> <span m='2001000'>I know everything except\
  \ r star, so I am going to solve</span> <span m='2007000'>for r star. Let's do that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2010000'>I am going to need the lights, here.</span> <span m='2020000'>If\
  \ I rearrange that equation, r star is equal to e squared</span> <span m='2025000'>over\
  \ 4 pi epsilon nought times the ionization energy of sodium</span> <span m='2030000'>minus\
  \ the electron affinity of chlorine.</span> <span m='2033000'>I know</span> <span\
  \ m='2038000'>what e star is. It is 1.602x10^-19 Coulomb's</span> <span m='2044000'>squared.\
  \ I have a 4 pi epsilon nought.</span> <span m='2048000'>I know what epsilon nought\
  \ is. And then, the difference</span> <span m='2054000'>between the ionization energy\
  \ and the electron affinity I</span> <span m='2061000'>calculated over there. That\
  \ is 147 kilojoules per mole</span> <span m='2067000'>or 1.47x10^5 joules per mole.\
  \ But now, and this is what</span> <span m='2075000'>everybody forgets on an exam,\
  \ I have to calculate r star per</span> <span m='2082000'>molecule, not per mole\
  \ because per mole does not make sense.</span> <span m='2089000'>And I have this\
  \ energy written here per mole,</span> <span m='2094000'>so I need an Avogadro's\
  \ number up here, 6.022x10^23 per mole.</span> <span m='2103000'>Don't forget Avogadro's\
  \ number when you calculate r.</span> <span m='2111000'>What is r star? Well, it\
  \ comes out to be</span> <span m='2118000'>9.45x10^-10 meters. Let's get a perspective\
  \ on</span> <span m='2126000'>these distances. The sodium atom diameter is 3.8</span>\
  \ <span m='2134000'>angstroms. Chlorine atom diameter,</span> <span m='2139000'>2\
  \ angstroms. What I am saying is that this</span> <span m='2145000'>electron can\
  \ jump, or does jump from sodium to</span> <span m='2151000'>chlorine at this distance\
  \ r star, which is equal to 9.45</span> <span m='2159000'>angstroms. So, the sodium\
  \ and the chlorine</span> <span m='2164000'>really are a considerable distance apart\
  \ when that</span> <span m='2169000'>electron jumps. But that electron can jump</span>\
  \ <span m='2172000'>because it is at that point that the Coulomb interaction is\
  \ large</span> <span m='2178000'>enough here to compensate for the difference in\
  \ the ionization</span> <span m='2184000'>energy and the electron affinity.</span>\
  \ <span m='2187000'>And this actual number, here, was verified in these</span> <span\
  \ m='2191000'>experiments by Herschbach and Lee.</span> <span m='2196000'>It actually\
  \ does happen. And this very simple classical</span> <span m='2201000'>model, where\
  \ we are actually treating the sodium and the</span> <span m='2206000'>chlorine\
  \ as point charges, we have forgotten everything</span> <span m='2211000'>else about\
  \ the electrons, that works remarkably well.</span> <span m='2215000'>Now, what\
  \ this model does not give you very well is the bond</span> <span m='2221000'>energy.\
  \ Because, if you look at this</span> <span m='2226000'>diagram again right in here,\
  \ let me go back on here,</span> <span m='2232000'>this 147 kilojoules here, that\
  \ I can look up.</span> <span m='2237000'>This 592 kilojoules, that is just the\
  \ Coulomb</span> <span m='2242000'>interaction between a positive and a negative\
  \ charge at 2.36</span> <span m='2249000'>eV. That is all that is.</span> <span\
  \ m='2252000'>You can calculate that. And so, therefore,</span> <span m='2256000'>if\
  \ I want to calculate the bond energy of sodium chloride,</span> <span m='2261000'>the\
  \ bond energy is just the difference between this energy</span> <span m='2266000'>and\
  \ that energy, and that is 435 kilojoules per</span> <span m='2270000'>mole. Well,\
  \ that does not come out so</span> <span m='2273000'>well in terms of the actual\
  \ bond energy.</span> <span m='2277000'>The actual bond energy is kilojoules per\
  \ mole.</span> <span m='2283000'>And we know why that did not come out too well.</span>\
  \ <span m='2287000'>That is because this depends on all of the interactions that\
  \ are</span> <span m='2294000'>much closer into the nucleus. By the time you get\
  \ down here,</span> <span m='2300000'>the repulsive interactions are present.</span>\
  \ <span m='2304000'>The nuclear-nuclear repulsions are present.</span> <span m='2310000'>And,\
  \ in our simple model, we did not take that into</span> <span m='2314000'>account,\
  \ the nuclear-nuclear repulsions.</span> <span m='2317000'>This simple model worked\
  \ to get r star because r star is further</span> <span m='2322000'>out. The nuclear-nuclear\
  \ repulsions</span> <span m='2325000'>have not really set in yet. Therefore, the\
  \ simple model</span> <span m='2329000'>works when you are at a far distance, when\
  \ r is large.</span> <span m='2334000'>But to get the bond strength, here, you are\
  \ much closer in.</span> <span m='2340000'>You are at 2.36 angstroms. That is the\
  \ difference in</span> <span m='2344000'>energy from here to there. We forgot about\
  \ the repulsive</span> <span m='2348000'>interactions between the two nuclei, so\
  \ the model is not</span> <span m='2353000'>going to work so close to the nucleus,\
  \ but it does a really</span> <span m='2358000'>good job of getting r star far away\
  \ from the nucleus.</span> <span m='2362000'>Again, this simple model only works\
  \ for very ionic compounds,</span> <span m='2367000'>very ionic bonds like sodium\
  \ chloride.</span> <span m='2372000'>It won't work very well for hydrogen chloride,</span>\
  \ <span m='2379000'>for example. Questions on that?</span> <span m='2383000'>Yes?</span>\
  \ <span m='2395000'>We are going to deal with entropy and Gibbs free energy</span>\
  \ <span m='2399000'>changes in a week or two. Right now, what I am writing</span>\
  \ <span m='2403000'>here are energy changes. I am actually dealing with</span> <span\
  \ m='2407000'>single molecules. I might have,</span> <span m='2410000'>in my mind,\
  \ here, energies per mole.</span> <span m='2413000'>But what I am thinking about\
  \ is not an ensemble of molecules.</span> <span m='2418000'>I am actually thinking\
  \ about what is happening in each</span> <span m='2423000'>individual single molecule\
  \ interaction.</span> <span m='2428000'>That is why I have not talked about delta\
  \ G here at all.</span> <span m='2433000'>And, in the field of chemical dynamics,\
  \ that is where we want</span> <span m='2438000'>to look at individual events as\
  \ opposed to a Boltzmann average</span> <span m='2444000'>of events. That is what\
  \ I am talking about</span> <span m='2448000'>right here, but we are going to talk\
  \ about collections of</span> <span m='2453000'>molecules and the energy changes.</span>\
  \ <span m='2458000'>I am going to change my definition from delta E to delta</span>\
  \ <span m='2465000'>H, the bond enthalpy, in a couple of days or so.</span> <span\
  \ m='2471000'>Other questions? Okay.</span> <span m='2474000'>Well, there is one\
  \ other just rather brief topic that I wanted</span> <span m='2482000'>to talk about.\
  \ That is, measuring dipole</span> <span m='2487000'>moments. And then, from the\
  \ dipole</span> <span m='2492000'>moments, getting out some ionic character to a\
  \ chemical bond.</span> <span m='2497000'>Your book actually calls ionic bonds polar\
  \ covalent bonds.</span> <span m='2501000'>And that is fine because even a very\
  \ ionic bond like sodium</span> <span m='2506000'>chloride is not completely ionic,\
  \ in the sense that when it</span> <span m='2511000'>is the molecule you know that\
  \ it is not a point charge on sodium</span> <span m='2516000'>and a point charge\
  \ on chlorine. You have an electron</span> <span m='2522000'>distribution when you\
  \ are that close.</span> <span m='2526000'>And so, what you have in an ionic bond\
  \ or a polar covalent</span> <span m='2533000'>bond, here, is an asymmetric charge\
  \ distribution.</span> <span m='2538000'>In HCl, here, you have both electrons,</span>\
  \ <span m='2543000'>on the average, being closer to the chlorine</span> <span m='2548000'>nucleus\
  \ than to the hydrogen nucleus.</span> <span m='2554000'>And you have that because\
  \ you have a bond between atoms with</span> <span m='2559000'>two very different\
  \ electronegativities.</span> <span m='2562000'>So, that is a polar covalent bond.</span>\
  \ <span m='2565000'>Now, what we are going to do is we are going to use this symbol</span>\
  \ <span m='2571000'>delta here as a measure of the amount of electron transfer.</span>\
  \ <span m='2576000'>Delta is the fraction of a full charge that is asymmetrically</span>\
  \ <span m='2581000'>distributed. This plus delta,</span> <span m='2585000'>this\
  \ delta that was on the hydrogen, is now on the</span> <span m='2589000'>chlorine.\
  \ That is the interpretation of</span> <span m='2592000'>that symbol. That asymmetric\
  \ charge</span> <span m='2595000'>distribution leads to a dipole moment, which is\
  \ defined as q,</span> <span m='2600000'>where q is the magnitude of the charge\
  \ separation,</span> <span m='2605000'>times r, where r is that charge separation.</span>\
  \ <span m='2608000'>It is, strictly speaking,</span> <span m='2614000'>a vector.\
  \ Q times R is what we define as</span> <span m='2619000'>a dipole moment. The units\
  \ of dipole moment is</span> <span m='2624000'>Coulombs times meters. You can see\
  \ that from Q times</span> <span m='2629000'>R. A dipole moment is also a</span>\
  \ <span m='2632000'>vector. I have the vector on this slide</span> <span m='2637000'>going\
  \ from the positively charged end to the negatively</span> <span m='2643000'>charged\
  \ end. That is the way your present</span> <span m='2647000'>book does it. In your\
  \ notes,</span> <span m='2649000'>I have it reversed. I have it reversed because\
  \ the</span> <span m='2652000'>last time I taught this, I was using a book that\
  \ used a</span> <span m='2656000'>different notation and I sent it out for Xeroxing\
  \ before I</span> <span m='2660000'>noticed it was different. So, change it around.</span>\
  \ <span m='2663000'>Not that it is every going to make any difference,</span> <span\
  \ m='2666000'>but your book has this convention from positive to</span> <span m='2669000'>negative.</span>\
  \ <span m='2677000'>This unit, though, of a Coulomb meter,</span> <span m='2680000'>is\
  \ a very large unit, an inconvenient unit,</span> <span m='2684000'>so we have another\
  \ unit. It is called the Debye,</span> <span m='2688000'>named after Peter Debye\
  \ who first studied these polar</span> <span m='2693000'>covalent molecules. And\
  \ a Debye,</span> <span m='2696000'>here, is defined as the following.</span> <span\
  \ m='2700000'>It is defined as if you have a full unit charge,</span> <span m='2705000'>not\
  \ a delta, moved from here to here,</span> <span m='2709000'>and the charge is separated\
  \ by 0.208 angstroms,</span> <span m='2715000'>that defines this unit called the\
  \ Debye.</span> <span m='2720000'>So, there are 0.208 angstroms per Debye.</span>\
  \ <span m='2731000'>If you knew the fraction of charge that is separated and you</span>\
  \ <span m='2736000'>knew the bond length in angstroms, and then you have our</span>\
  \ <span m='2741000'>definition for a Debye, which is 0.208 angstroms per</span>\
  \ <span m='2746000'>Debye, you could calculate the dipole moment in Debye.</span>\
  \ <span m='2751000'>Usually what we do is not to calculate the dipole moment.</span>\
  \ <span m='2757000'>We usually measure the dipole moment and calculate the partial</span>\
  \ <span m='2762000'>charge distribution. Because we usually don't know</span> <span\
  \ m='2768000'>this. We can measure that.</span> <span m='2770000'>We can measure\
  \ the dipole moments in kind of a capacitor</span> <span m='2774000'>arrangement,\
  \ where we have some molecules that have a dipole</span> <span m='2778000'>moment,\
  \ a positive charge on one plate, a negative charge on the</span> <span m='2783000'>other.\
  \ And, when you do that,</span> <span m='2785000'>of course, these electric dipoles\
  \ are going to align.</span> <span m='2790000'>That is going to change the capacitance.</span>\
  \ <span m='2792000'>If this capacitor is part of a resonant circuit,</span> <span\
  \ m='2796000'>it is going to change the resonant frequent.</span> <span m='2799000'>The\
  \ resonant frequency is related to the dipole moment.</span> <span m='2803000'>And,\
  \ in that way, you calculate or measure the</span> <span m='2806000'>dipole moment.\
  \ That is how it was originally</span> <span m='2809000'>done. However, you can\
  \ now measure</span> <span m='2812000'>dipole moments very accurately by rotational\
  \ spectroscopy.</span> <span m='2816000'>And we are going to look at that in a few\
  \ lectures or so.</span> <span m='2822000'>But take HCl right here. Here is HCl.</span>\
  \ <span m='2825000'>Here is the measured dipole moment, and here is the bond</span>\
  \ <span m='2830000'>length. We can use these two pieces of</span> <span m='2833000'>information\
  \ to calculate the fraction of charge distributed.</span> <span m='2839000'>And,\
  \ in the case of HCl, that is about 0.18.</span> <span m='2843000'>Sometimes, we\
  \ refer to this in a percentage.</span> <span m='2848000'>So, this would be 18%\
  \ of a charge separation.</span> <span m='2852000'>Sometimes we say 18% ionic character\
  \ in HCl.</span> <span m='2856000'>That compares to something like 70% or 80% in\
  \ sodium chloride or</span> <span m='2863000'>lithium chloride. So, HCl is not anywhere\
  \ near as</span> <span m='2868000'>ionic. The charge distribution is not</span>\
  \ <span m='2871000'>as asymmetric as it is in sodium chloride or lithium chloride.</span>\
  \ <span m='2879000'>Thank you very much for hanging in here today.</span> <span\
  \ m='2883000'>It has been hot. Have a nice cool weekend.</span> <span m='2887875'>See\
  \ you next Wednesday.</span> </p>"
