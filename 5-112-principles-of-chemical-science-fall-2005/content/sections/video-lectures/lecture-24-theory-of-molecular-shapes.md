  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Today I would like to
  start by discussing a timeline.</span> </p><p><span m='19000'>And you will see in
  a moment what this timeline has to do</span> <span m='25000'>with. It is obviously
  only a partial</span> <span m='28000'>timeline. But let's start here in 1916,</span>
  <span m='33000'>as we have done this semester, by talking about the Lewis</span>
  <span m='39000'>theory of electronic structure.</span> </p><p><span m='50000'>And
  his electron pair theory is something we are going to come</span> <span m='56000'>back
  to a couple of times during lecture today.</span> </p><p><span m='62000'>Let's move
  on to 1954. 1954 was an important year in</span> <span m='67000'>electronic structure
  theory, because in that year there was</span> <span m='73000'>awarded, to Linus
  Pauling, the Nobel Prize in chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='79000'>Let me write
  down Pauling here.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>And if you are interested in knowing
  something about what</span> <span m='93000'>Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize
  in chemistry for,</span> <span m='96000'>I will show you over here on the side boards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125000'>What you are going to see here, if you read this citation
  for</span> <span m='130000'>Linus Carl Pauling in 1954 for the Nobel Prize in chemistry,</span>
  <span m='135000'>his prize was awarded principally for his</span> <span m='138000'>contributions
  to our understanding of the nature of</span> <span m='142000'>the chemical bond.
  If you think back to the</span> <span m='146000'>elegant title of the paper by Lewis
  that we started out our</span> <span m='151000'>discussion of acid-base theory with,
  it was a paper entitled</span> <span m='156000'>"The Atom and the Molecule." And
  now we have gotten to Pauling,</span> <span m='160000'>in 1954, who is being awarded
  a Nobel Prize in chemistry for the</span> <span m='165000'>nature of the chemical
  bond. That also is the title of a</span> <span m='170000'>very famous chemistry
  book by Linus Pauling entitled "The</span> <span m='174000'>Nature of the Chemical
  Bond." That was published by Cornell</span> <span m='180000'>University Press originally,
  because it stemmed from his set</span> <span m='184000'>of lectures at Cornell,
  the Baker lectures,</span> <span m='188000'>in the 1950s. As we talk about electronic</span>
  <span m='191000'>structure theory, I would like you to keep in</span> <span m='194000'>mind
  the way in which these different geniuses were</span> <span m='198000'>approaching
  the problem, a problem that we are going to</span> <span m='202000'>launch in on
  today and spend the next few lectures on.</span> </p><p><span m='206000'>We will
  move up here to 1966.</span> </p><p><span m='215000'>In 1966 there was awarded a
  Nobel Prize to Mulliken.</span> </p><p><span m='229000'>Not to be confused with
  Milliken.</span> </p><p><span m='248000'>We are going from 1954 to 1966.</span>
  </p><p><span m='274000'>You are going to find, as you explore the Nobel Prize</span>
  <span m='277000'>website, that there are a lot of informational links on these</span>
  <span m='281000'>people. You can go and read</span> <span m='283000'>biographies.
  You can read some of their</span> <span m='286000'>writings. In the case of Linus
  Pauling,</span> <span m='288000'>you have links to all the pages of all of his research</span>
  <span m='292000'>notebooks, spanning more than 60 years of research.</span> </p><p><span
  m='295000'>Those are pretty interesting supportive materials.</span> </p><p><span
  m='300000'>In the case of Robert S. Mulliken, he is being cited for</span> <span
  m='303000'>his contributions to the molecular orbital method,</span> <span m='307000'>which
  we will also call the molecular orbital theory.</span> </p><p><span m='310000'>We
  have the Lewis theory. We have, in the case of</span> <span m='313000'>Pauling,
  I am going to say the nature of the chemical bond,</span> <span m='317000'>described
  in terms of valance bond theory.</span> </p><p><span m='320000'>We will come back
  to that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='323000'>And then, in the case of Mulliken,
  we have a Nobel Prize</span> <span m='326000'>for molecular orbital theory. And
  I just would like to show</span> <span m='333000'>you something kind of neat, here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='336000'>This has to do with the fact that if I go to the section</span>
  <span m='343000'>labeled other resources, I can click on MIT digital</span> <span
  m='348000'>thesis library. Then I can choose a page of</span> <span m='353000'>Mulliken's
  thesis to display. And that is because Robert S.</span> </p><p><span m='361000'>Mulliken
  was Course 5 1917. Let's hear it for Course 5</span> <span m='366000'>chemistry.
  [APPLAUSE] Robert S.</span> </p><p><span m='369000'>Mulliken was one of you guys,
  and he graduated in 1917.</span> </p><p><span m='375000'>His undergraduate chemistry
  thesis at MIT was entitled "The</span> <span m='381000'>Effective Structure on the
  Activity of the Hydroxyl Group</span> <span m='387000'>in Alcohols." Submitted by
  Robert S.</span> </p><p><span m='391000'>Mulliken. There is his signature.</span>
  </p><p><span m='393000'>Isn't it cool to have your undergraduate thesis linked in</span>
  <span m='397000'>from the Nobel Prize website? Robert S.</span> </p><p><span m='399000'>Mulliken
  for molecular orbital theory.</span> </p><p><span m='401000'>And you can see, even
  as you read his</span> <span m='404000'>undergraduate thesis, he was talking about
  the effect</span> <span m='407000'>of structure on the activity of the hydroxyl
  group.</span> </p><p><span m='410000'>He had the idea that if you knew something
  about the</span> <span m='414000'>structure of the molecule, even back then,</span>
  <span m='416000'>you could make predictions about the properties of the</span> <span
  m='420000'>molecule. And that is what we really want</span> <span m='424000'>to
  be able to do in chemistry, because we want to be able to</span> <span m='429000'>control
  function as much as possible.</span> </p><p><span m='432000'>I will take that way
  for now and we'll come back in a moment</span> <span m='436000'>because I am going
  to mention to you that in 1998 there was</span> <span m='441000'>another Nobel Prize
  given for advances in our understanding of</span> <span m='446000'>electronic structure
  of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='450000'>And this one was a shared prize, rather
  than these three</span> <span m='455000'>other ones that I mentioned. Well, two
  others.</span> </p><p><span m='460000'>Lewis was neglected from that category, unfortunately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='465000'>In 1998 Kohn and Pople shared the Nobel Prize for furthering</span>
  <span m='471000'>our understanding of how to describe electronic structure of</span>
  <span m='477000'>molecules. And this is a theory that we</span> <span m='482000'>are
  not going to be talking about too much explicitly here</span> <span m='486000'>in
  5.112 this semester, but if you go on in chemistry,</span> <span m='490000'>you
  will be exposed to it more and more.</span> </p><p><span m='493000'>It is called
  density functional theory.</span> </p><p><span m='496000'>It is one of the most
  expedient ways to use computers to get</span> <span m='500000'>electronic structure
  information about molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='504000'>And so, that method
  has become extremely important.</span> </p><p><span m='509000'>And I will just show
  you a little piece of information from</span> <span m='513000'>that website, so
  we go to 1998.</span> </p><p><span m='516000'>And, under the John Pople section,
  I am going to go to</span> <span m='521000'>interview. He has given an interview
  on</span> <span m='524000'>different topics relating to his involvement in chemistry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='529000'>One short piece of that interview is entitled "Interest</span>
  <span m='533000'>in Quantum Mechanics and Development of Computer</span> <span m='537000'>Techniques."
  We are going to take a look at</span> <span m='542000'>that and hopefully, if the
  audio and video are both</span> <span m='546000'>working, you will be able to see
  John Pople talking a little bit</span> <span m='550000'>about this important area
  of chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='553000'>We just don't have time for fixing
  audio/video problems in</span> <span m='558000'>real-time here, unfortunately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='560000'>Therefore, what I would like you to do is go to</span> <span
  m='563000'>NobelPrize.org, Chemistry Laureates on Pople,</span> <span m='567000'>and
  actually watch that five-minute segment of his</span> <span m='570000'>interview
  that has to do with his feelings about electronic</span> <span m='575000'>structure
  theory and advice to students on that topic.</span> </p><p><span m='587000'>And
  I will summarize his comments here --</span> <span m='605000'>-- by saying that
  the goal of studying electronic structure of</span> <span m='611000'>molecules is
  to try to get predictive power about molecular</span> <span m='616000'>systems.
  And we want predictive power in</span> <span m='620000'>terms of the 3D structure
  of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>We know how to represent connectivity
  in molecules in two</span> <span m='634000'>dimensions. We have been doing that
  already</span> <span m='637000'>quite a bit this semester. But we would like to
  know,</span> <span m='641000'>if you know which atoms are bonded to which.</span>
  </p><p><span m='644000'>And then how does that translate into the intricate</span>
  <span m='648000'>three-dimensional structures that molecules can have?</span> </p><p><span
  m='652000'>Also, molecules can have color. That is an important property</span>
  <span m='657000'>of a molecular system. In addition to which,</span> <span m='661000'>molecules
  can be magnetic. So, magnetism is one of the</span> <span m='666000'>important properties
  of molecular systems.</span> </p><p><span m='670000'>And, as they aggregate into
  extended solid materials,</span> <span m='675000'>the way in which magnetic molecules
  interact to produce</span> <span m='680000'>macroscopic magnetic phenomena is very
  much an area of interest</span> <span m='685000'>to chemists. People want to design
  molecular</span> <span m='690000'>magnets in order to be able to make materials
  that have desired</span> <span m='695000'>properties that will be useful to us in
  building things.</span> </p><p><span m='700000'>And then, of course, we have molecules
  that are</span> <span m='704000'>redox-active. And redox properties are very</span>
  <span m='707000'>important. We would like to be able to sit</span> <span m='711000'>down
  with our computer and draw out a structure.</span> </p><p><span m='716000'>We would
  like to be able to pop it into its optimum 3D geometry</span> <span m='720000'>and
  find out what that is. We would like to then know how</span> <span m='724000'>easy
  is it to remove an electron from that system or how easy it</span> <span m='729000'>is
  to add an electron to that system.</span> </p><p><span m='731000'>Can we sit down
  and, right from the start,</span> <span m='734000'>use theory to predict properties
  like the energies</span> <span m='738000'>associated with electron transfer to and
  from a molecular</span> <span m='742000'>system? That would be important if we</span>
  <span m='746000'>are going to do what I talked about last time in terms of</span>
  <span m='751000'>inventing systems to transform light energy into chemical</span>
  <span m='755000'>energy in terms of the water splitting reaction I discussed</span>
  <span m='760000'>last time. Also, molecules have acid-base</span> <span m='764000'>chemistry.
  And this is one of the most</span> <span m='767000'>pervasive forms of chemical
  reactivity that we can discuss.</span> </p><p><span m='772000'>And so, we really
  have been talking, so far in my lectures,</span> <span m='776000'>about redox chemistry
  and acid-base chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='782000'>And, as I go on, during
  the next few lectures,</span> <span m='785000'>we are going to be also talking about
  properties like color and</span> <span m='790000'>magnetism and 3D structure from
  theoretical considerations.</span> </p><p><span m='794000'>Acid-base is one type
  of reactivity, but then also there</span> <span m='798000'>are all kinds of different
  modes of reactivity that can be</span> <span m='802000'>classified in different
  ways. Just to give you an example,</span> <span m='806000'>there is a class of reactions
  in organic chemistry called</span> <span m='811000'>electrocyclic reactions. We
  will be talking a little bit</span> <span m='817000'>about reactions of that sort.
  And then there is something</span> <span m='823000'>that Professor Ceyer referred
  to earlier in the semester as</span> <span m='829000'>stability and the idea that
  this can take on both kinetic and</span> <span m='836000'>thermodynamic forms. And
  so, we would want,</span> <span m='840000'>from first principles, to be able to
  sit down and</span> <span m='844000'>consider a molecular system composed of whatever
  elements</span> <span m='848000'>from whatever part of the periodic table it is
  composed,</span> <span m='852000'>and just how these properties follow naturally
  from the</span> <span m='856000'>collection of elements that you have put together
  into a</span> <span m='860000'>molecule. This is really chemistry and</span> <span
  m='863000'>this is what we would like to be able to do.</span> </p><p><span m='868000'>In
  this next part, what I would like to do is just</span> <span m='873000'>spend a
  little time right here in 1957 because that is when</span> <span m='880000'>Ronald
  Gillespie published his VSEPR theory.</span> </p><p><span m='900000'>Ronald Gillespie
  is now kind of in the twilight of his career.</span> </p><p><span m='905000'>He
  has published on his "Lifetime in Chemistry." And so,</span> <span m='910000'>you
  can Google Ronald Gillespie and find information about him</span> <span m='915000'>and
  his VSEPR theory that will go well beyond what you will</span> <span m='921000'>find
  in that section devoted to it in your textbook.</span> </p><p><span m='925000'>This
  VSEPR theory, it is an acronym.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>And it stands for
  Valance-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion theory.</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>I tell
  you, the closer you get to the board the less easily you</span> <span m='965000'>can
  see the things on that board.</span> </p><p><span m='968000'>When we talk about
  VSEPR theory, Ronald Gillespie</span> <span m='972000'>formulates it simply in terms
  of five basic considerations.</span> </p><p><span m='977000'>The first of these,
  you can tell very easily from</span> <span m='981000'>the name, and that is that
  electron pairs repel each other.</span> </p><p><span m='994000'>And note here I
  am underlining the word "pairs." And that is</span> <span m='998000'>because we
  know that electrons are all negatively charged</span> <span m='1002000'>particles.
  And so they should all</span> <span m='1005000'>individually repel each other. And
  they do,</span> <span m='1008000'>in fact. But, based on the ideas of</span> <span
  m='1010000'>Lewis, you will see that Gillespie is formulating this</span> <span
  m='1014000'>theory, taking the notion of the electron pair as the fundamental</span>
  <span m='1019000'>unit to consider. And he is saying that electron</span> <span
  m='1024000'>pairs are somehow organized in space in a manner that they</span> <span
  m='1029000'>repel each other, and they try to occupy</span> <span m='1032000'>different
  regions of space from one another.</span> </p><p><span m='1035000'>And this is going
  to be useful in terms of predicting the 3D</span> <span m='1040000'>structure of
  molecules, and this is what this theory is</span> <span m='1044000'>devoted to.
  And, two molecules can have</span> <span m='1047000'>single bonds, or they can have
  double bonds,</span> <span m='1051000'>or they can have triple bonds between pairs
  of atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='1057000'>Maybe we will see this semester also that
  molecules can have</span> <span m='1061000'>quadruple bonds between pairs of atoms
  if the orbitals are</span> <span m='1066000'>available for that. But in the VSEPR
  theory,</span> <span m='1069000'>in this context multiple bonds are treated like
  single bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='1089000'>You might suspect that that type of
  approximation is a</span> <span m='1092000'>little crude and that it might lead
  to certain guesses that</span> <span m='1095000'>might turn out not to be quite
  right, but actually it is a</span> <span m='1099000'>useful enough approximation
  for the prediction of the</span> <span m='1102000'>three-dimensional structures
  of a lot of different molecules</span> <span m='1106000'>that we are actually going
  to adopt for the purposes of our</span> <span m='1109000'>treatment of VSEPR theory.
  Number three:</span> <span m='1114000'>if you have multiple central atoms, --</span>
  <span m='1127000'>- they are treated independently.</span> </p><p><span m='1135000'>And
  you will see what I mean by that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1138000'>You
  should see, from that statement,</span> <span m='1140000'>that in the context of
  VSEPR theory, we are going to be</span> <span m='1144000'>trying to identify central
  atoms and peripheral atoms that are</span> <span m='1148000'>attached all to the
  central atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1151000'>And there may be one or more central
  atoms in a molecule that</span> <span m='1156000'>themselves are interconnected.
  And, four, we have two kinds of</span> <span m='1162000'>electron pairs that we
  consider in VSEPR theory.</span> </p><p><span m='1166000'>We have lone pairs, and
  we have bond pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='1175000'>And lone pairs occupy more space
  --</span> <span m='1188000'>-- than bond pairs do.</span> </p><p><span m='1195000'>And
  we will discuss the reason for that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='1200000'>Finally,
  I want to give you rule number five for 3D</span> <span m='1204000'>structure prediction
  using VSEPR.</span> </p><p><span m='1207000'>That is that lone pairs are not included
  in the description of</span> <span m='1213000'>the structure. And you will see what
  I mean by</span> <span m='1217000'>that in a moment. The idea is that the names
  that</span> <span m='1222000'>we give to different molecular structures have to
  do with the</span> <span m='1227000'>3D arrangement in space of the nuclei only
  and not the</span> <span m='1232000'>electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='1240000'>The
  lone pairs are not included in the structure description.</span> </p><p><span m='1251000'>This
  is reserved for the nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='1255000'>Now, let's do a couple
  of examples.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>And, in introducing these examples,
  I will also be giving</span> <span m='1265000'>you some more of the shorthand that
  is associated with VSEPR</span> <span m='1270000'>treatment of molecular structure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1273000'>Let's talk about this one here.</span> </p><p><span m='1284000'>I
  have drawn here a very simple Lewis dot structure for a</span> <span m='1289000'>hydrogen
  sulfide molecule, H2S.</span> </p><p><span m='1292000'>And for a molecule like this,
  we really only have two</span> <span m='1295000'>possibilities for the structure
  because you have three nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='1300000'>And so, either they
  can all be arranged -- we are going to</span> <span m='1304000'>assume that nuclei
  are not going to fuse together and be one on</span> <span m='1308000'>top of another
  because those positively charged nuclei do</span> <span m='1312000'>indeed repel
  each other very successfully -- and so,</span> <span m='1316000'>therefore, we could
  either have a linear or a bent structure.</span> </p><p><span m='1331000'>And we
  can approach that question using the VSEPR theory</span> <span m='1339000'>very
  nicely. We start out by recognizing</span> <span m='1345000'>that we have two lone
  pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='1355000'>That would be this one and this one in the
  Lewis dot structure</span> <span m='1359000'>that are not interacting with both
  hydrogen and sulfur nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='1364000'>And we will call those
  E. And then we have two bond</span> <span m='1369000'>pairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1378000'>And we will refer to those each as X.</span> </p><p><span m='1382000'>And
  then we have a single central atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1387000'>We have a central
  sulfur atom. And the central atom is usually</span> <span m='1395000'>given the
  label A. And so, that means that we have</span> <span m='1402000'>a system here
  of the type AX two E two.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>And if you look at the
  general class of molecules of the type</span> <span m='1416000'>AX two E two, it
  turns out that we can draw</span> <span m='1422000'>their structures this way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1432000'>What I am trying to indicate in this structure is that
  one of</span> <span m='1435000'>these lone pairs is coming up and out of the board
  this way</span> <span m='1439000'>and the other one is going back behind the board
  the other way.</span> </p><p><span m='1444000'>These are our two bond pairs that
  I am representing as lines.</span> </p><p><span m='1448000'>Bond pairs occupy less
  space than lone pairs do,</span> <span m='1452000'>and that is because you have
  two electrons interacting with</span> <span m='1456000'>two positively charged nuclei.
  Whereas, in the case of a lone</span> <span m='1460000'>pair, you have a single
  pair of electrons interacting only with</span> <span m='1465000'>a singly positively
  charged nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='1469000'>Two nuclei cause a greater localization
  in space of bond</span> <span m='1474000'>pairs, as compared with lone pairs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1477000'>And the angle here that this vector associated with the
  lone</span> <span m='1483000'>pair direction makes to the hydrogen is something</span>
  <span m='1488000'>approximately tetrahedral. Actually, probably larger than</span>
  <span m='1493000'>tetrahedral in this case because the H-S-H angle is smaller than</span>
  <span m='1499000'>tetrahedral in H two S. But this is an angle certainly</span>
  <span m='1507000'>greater than 90 degrees. And that is one of our angles</span>
  <span m='1512000'>of the type E-A-X that describes the interaction of a lone pair</span>
  <span m='1518000'>with a bond pair. What we want to do is maximize</span> <span
  m='1523000'>those E-A-E and E-A-X angles because, as I was saying</span> <span m='1528000'>earlier,
  a lone pair of electrons requires a greater</span> <span m='1533000'>amount of space
  than does a bond pair of electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='1540000'>The magnitude
  of the repulsions, if we get back to</span> <span m='1543000'>the word repulsion
  in the name of this theory,</span> <span m='1546000'>the greatest repulsions are
  found between lone pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='1550000'>And so, next we have repulsions
  between lone pairs and bond</span> <span m='1554000'>pairs. And then, finally,</span>
  <span m='1556000'>the weakest repulsions in the system will be between bond</span>
  <span m='1560000'>pairs. And so, the best</span> <span m='1563000'>three-dimensional
  structure given by this theory is that</span> <span m='1568000'>which minimizes
  these different repulsions in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='1573000'>If we
  considered the linear structure, then what we would</span> <span m='1578000'>have
  to do is put all the electrons in the same plane of</span> <span m='1583000'>the
  molecule. And these angles here would</span> <span m='1587000'>have to be 90. And,
  overall,</span> <span m='1591000'>this would be a higher energy structure because
  of the</span> <span m='1595000'>necessity of putting in an E lone pair at 90 degrees
  to a</span> <span m='1600000'>couple of bond pairs and so on around the molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1604000'>Three dimensionally in space, this quasi-tetrahedral geometry</span>
  <span m='1609000'>gets the four pairs of electrons of the molecule the farthest</span>
  <span m='1614000'>apart in space and minimizes electron pair repulsion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1620000'>And that leads, therefore, to a description of</span> <span m='1623000'>the
  structure as bent. The structure is called bent</span> <span m='1626000'>rather
  than tetrahedral because we include only the nuclei in</span> <span m='1631000'>the
  way that we refer to the structure of the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1635000'>And
  we do not include those electron pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='1638000'>Let me give
  you a feel for how this looks.</span> </p><p><span m='1656000'>And in this picture
  that I am going to show you,</span> <span m='1660000'>which will recall to mind
  some that I showed you in my first</span> <span m='1666000'>couple of lectures,
  you will see that what I have</span> <span m='1671000'>here is an electron density
  isosurface for the H two S</span> <span m='1677000'>molecule. And you can see here
  one of the</span> <span m='1682000'>S-H bonds. Here is another S-H bond.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1684000'>Over here is that region in space where the electron density</span>
  <span m='1688000'>isosurface is associated with lone pairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1691000'>And you can see that certainly the electron density is a lot</span>
  <span m='1695000'>more tightly contracted in the region between the sulfurs and</span>
  <span m='1699000'>the hydrogens than it is elsewhere, where it bulges out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1703000'>And you can see that effect of getting the eight valance</span>
  <span m='1706000'>electrons in this molecule as far apart from each other in</span>
  <span m='1710000'>space as you can. And then, furthermore,</span> <span m='1714000'>the
  coloring in this diagram represents the propensity of</span> <span m='1719000'>electrons
  at that point in space to come together as pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='1724000'>In
  effect, that coloring is the three-dimensional manifestation</span> <span m='1729000'>of
  the Pauli principle mapped onto an electron density</span> <span m='1733000'>isosurface
  for the H two S *molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1738000'>This type of picture
  is very nicely associated with the VSEPR</span> <span m='1743000'>representation
  of molecular structure.</span> </p><p><span m='1746000'>And I am going to go through
  another example.</span> </p><p><span m='1750000'>I am numbering this off so as not
  to distract you with that</span> <span m='1755000'>picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1762000'>This next example is SF four.</span> </p><p><span m='1782000'>Let me
  draw out a Lewis dot structure of this.</span> </p><p><span m='1804000'>As you are
  looking at this Lewis dot structure,</span> <span m='1807000'>one of the things
  you should do is to see if the number of</span> <span m='1811000'>electrons that
  I am including in my drawing is,</span> <span m='1814000'>in fact, the correct number
  of valance electrons for this</span> <span m='1818000'>system. And that is easy
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1820000'>You know that fluorine is in Group 19 of
  the Periodic Table.</span> </p><p><span m='1825000'>You know that sulfur is in Group
  6 of the Periodic Table.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>And so you can quickly
  figure out how many valance electrons</span> <span m='1834000'>there should be.
  And, hopefully,</span> <span m='1837000'>I have indicated all of them on my drawing,
  and no more than all</span> <span m='1841000'>of them. What you might not like about
  a</span> <span m='1845000'>drawing like this is that while each fluorine has been</span>
  <span m='1849000'>represented as an octet, as being associated with eight</span>
  <span m='1853000'>electrons, four pairs of electrons, the central sulfur</span>
  <span m='1857000'>atom seems to be, in this drawing,</span> <span m='1860000'>associated
  with ten electrons, --</span> <span m='1864000'>-- doesn't it? That seems to be
  a violation of</span> <span m='1867000'>the octet rule. And I will defer that</span>
  <span m='1870000'>observation for now, but it is an interesting</span> <span m='1873000'>feature
  of this. And, when you do yourself write</span> <span m='1876000'>down Lewis structures
  as a prelude to subjecting them to</span> <span m='1881000'>the valence bond theory
  of Pauling or to the valence shell</span> <span m='1885000'>electron pair repulsion
  theory of Gillespie or the molecular</span> <span m='1889000'>orbital theory of
  Mulliken or the density functional theory of</span> <span m='1894000'>Kohn and Pople,
  you should be sticking with the</span> <span m='1897000'>basics here and making
  sure you are working with the right</span> <span m='1902000'>number of valance electrons
  -- -- because your whole initial</span> <span m='1907000'>description of the molecular
  system is going to revolve</span> <span m='1910000'>around the correct distribution
  in space of this number of</span> <span m='1913000'>valance electrons that these
  atoms that you are including in</span> <span m='1916000'>the molecule bring into
  play. And then you are going to see</span> <span m='1919000'>if you can predict
  properties based on that.</span> </p><p><span m='1922000'>That is what we do first.
  And, in terms of bond pairs,</span> <span m='1932000'>based on that structure, we
  have four.</span> </p><p><span m='1940000'>And, in terms of lone pairs, we have
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='1950000'>Therefore, the type of system that we are working
  with here is</span> <span m='1957000'>AX four E. This is one of the possible</span>
  <span m='1962000'>types, when you have five units, surrounding a central atom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1969000'>And the most typical type of geometry that arises when
  we</span> <span m='1976000'>have five units surrounding a central atom is as follows.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1984000'>The atom A at the center is intended to be here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1988000'>And then I am going to draw five balls.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1993000'>You can think of them as representing either lone pairs</span> <span
  m='1998000'>or fluorine atoms. And I am going to color two of</span> <span m='2003000'>them
  to distinguish them from the others.</span> </p><p><span m='2009000'>And this structure
  is called TBP.</span> </p><p><span m='2013000'>And that standards for trigonal bipyramidal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2027000'>And the reason I have colored this type different from
  that</span> <span m='2031000'>type is that in a trigonal bipyramidal structure,</span>
  <span m='2034000'>there are two possible environments,</span> <span m='2036000'>either
  for a lone pair of electrons or for a bond pair of</span> <span m='2040000'>electrons.
  You can have axial,</span> <span m='2044000'>and the axial position is easily distinguished
  from the</span> <span m='2050000'>equatorial position --</span> <span m='2058000'>--
  by virtue of the fact that an atom or a lone pair in the</span> <span m='2063000'>axial
  position makes 90 degree angles, three of them to its</span> <span m='2068000'>neighbors.
  Whereas, an atom in the</span> <span m='2071000'>equatorial position makes two 90
  degree angles with respect to</span> <span m='2075000'>its neighbors. It is three
  versus two that</span> <span m='2078000'>will help you distinguish axial from equatorial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2082000'>And understanding that about this molecular geometry,</span>
  <span m='2085000'>you can see that for the SF four molecule there are</span> <span
  m='2089000'>two possibilities. Note that when I am drawing a</span> <span m='2093000'>wedge
  here that means that the atom connected to the central</span> <span m='2097000'>atom
  is coming out of the plane at us.</span> </p><p><span m='2101000'>And the dashed
  bond means that it is going back behind the</span> <span m='2106000'>plane so that
  viewed from the top, this thing would look</span> <span m='2112000'>simply like
  a Mercedes Benz symbol, just to understand that</span> <span m='2117000'>about the
  wedges and dash nomenclature on these systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2123000'>And
  so, the two possibilities that we have for our system is,</span> <span m='2129000'>we
  can either put our lone pair E up here and our four bond</span> <span m='2135000'>pairs
  X down here. Or, we can have the lone pair</span> <span m='2141000'>equatorial and
  our bond pairs, two of them axial and two of</span> <span m='2147000'>them equatorial.
  As in the case of H two S,</span> <span m='2151000'>we had two structures to distinguish
  between linear</span> <span m='2157000'>and bent. Over here, we have a structure</span>
  <span m='2161000'>with an equatorial lone pair or with an axial lone pair for SF</span>
  <span m='2166000'>four. And when you look at the top</span> <span m='2169000'>one
  and realize that you have only two of these very bad lone</span> <span m='2174000'>pair-bond
  pair contacts at 90 degrees, whereas,</span> <span m='2177000'>on the bottom one
  we have three of these bad lone pair-bond pair</span> <span m='2182000'>contacts
  at 90 degrees, you might be inclined to pick,</span> <span m='2187000'>in fact,
  this top one.</span> </p><p><span m='2195000'>And that would be right because it
  minimizes the number of the</span> <span m='2199000'>worst kind of repulsions. In
  this case,</span> <span m='2201000'>lone pair bond pair at 90 degrees.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2203000'>And when we give this structure a name, we are not going to call</span>
  <span m='2208000'>it trigonal bipyramidal because we do not include the lone pair.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2212000'>We only include the positions of the nuclei in the naming
  of</span> <span m='2216000'>the molecular structure. This one is called a seesaw.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2226000'>Some of you may be aware that there is a piece of playground</span>
  <span m='2231000'>equipment known as a seesaw. You probably don't get a chance</span>
  <span m='2237000'>to play on them anymore very much.</span> </p><p><span m='2240000'>Neither
  do I. This is more fun,</span> <span m='2243000'>anyway. And what I am showing you
  now</span> <span m='2247000'>on these side screens is a picture of the electron
  density</span> <span m='2252000'>isosurface for the SF four molecule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2258000'>And hopefully, you can see that it looks like</span> <span m='2261000'>a
  seesaw. These two fluorines down here</span> <span m='2263000'>would be the legs
  of the seesaw. And then you would sit either</span> <span m='2268000'>here or here
  and then lean forward and put your hands on</span> <span m='2272000'>the lone pair
  and then rock up and down somehow.</span> </p><p><span m='2275000'>I don't know.
  Anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2278000'>In this system, you should be able to see
  that</span> <span m='2281000'>the lone pair on the sulfur, which is here,</span>
  <span m='2284000'>is definitely in this equatorial position,</span> <span m='2288000'>so
  the electro-density isosurface has a nice dark-blue</span> <span m='2292000'>color
  where we find that lone pair on the sulfur.</span> </p><p><span m='2296000'>And
  then the four flourines are organized, according to the</span> <span m='2300000'>predictions
  of VSEPR theory, with these 90 degree angles to</span> <span m='2305000'>the flourines
  that are oriented in the axial.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>The two flourines
  are axial. And then here is our two</span> <span m='2315000'>equatorial flourines
  here spinning around in the belt of</span> <span m='2320000'>this system. We could
  also say that you</span> <span m='2323000'>would be sitting on the axial positions
  if you were going to</span> <span m='2329000'>ride on this particular seesaw. Now,
  I would like to proceed in</span> <span m='2335659'>time briefly back from '57 to</span>
  <span m='2340000'>Because we need to discuss some of the issues of the valance</span>
  <span m='2342000'>bond theory that Pauling brought into the quantum mechanical</span>
  <span m='2345000'>treatment of molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2376000'>What I
  am representing here are a couple of hydrogen atoms 1S</span> <span m='2382000'>orbitals
  at a distance. We have (H)A 1s and we have the</span> <span m='2387000'>1s of hydrogen
  labeled B.</span> </p><p><span m='2391000'>And we are going to say that at some
  infinite separation between</span> <span m='2398000'>the two, they would not really
  know much about the spin of the</span> <span m='2404000'>electron on the partner
  hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='2409000'>But as we bring them close together, the
  spin is going to</span> <span m='2413000'>become very important. And that is by
  virtue of the</span> <span m='2417000'>Pauli principle. And you should remember
  that</span> <span m='2420000'>one of the ways of formulating the Pauli principle
  is that no</span> <span m='2425000'>two electrons in a quantum mechanical system
  can have the</span> <span m='2429000'>same set of four quantum numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2433000'>As these two hydrogens get close together,</span> <span m='2436000'>the
  stable situation for the electrons coming from the two</span> <span m='2442000'>have
  opposite spin, so I am drawing with spin-up</span> <span m='2446000'>and one with
  spin-down. And then you are going to</span> <span m='2450000'>notice that here in
  the center of our H two molecule,</span> <span m='2456000'>now, is a region of overlap
  and of constructive interference of</span> <span m='2462000'>those 1s-orbital wave
  functions from the two sides.</span> </p><p><span m='2468000'>In this representation
  of the ground state of the molecule,</span> <span m='2472000'>the Pauli principle
  is satisfied.</span> </p><p><span m='2474000'>And we can put this pair of electrons
  into an orbital.</span> </p><p><span m='2478000'>And when that orbital is represented
  that way,</span> <span m='2482000'>it is cylindrically symmetric.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2495000'>And we call that a sigma bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2506000'>In chemistry
  we talk often about the properties of sigma</span> <span m='2510000'>bonds. We talk
  about also the</span> <span m='2513000'>properties of things called pi bonds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2516000'>And we can even have delta bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='2520000'>Just
  as I was talking about bond multiplicity a moment ago</span> <span m='2527000'>with
  reference to VSEPR, let me give you here an</span> <span m='2533000'>x,y-plane.
  I am drawing in perspective an</span> <span m='2538000'>x,y-plane. And in this x,y-plane
  we are</span> <span m='2543000'>going to have, actually, six atomic nuclei.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2550000'>And our z direction is perpendicular to this plane</span>
  <span m='2555000'>drawn in perspective. And I am drawing in here the</span> <span
  m='2560000'>positions of four hydrogen and two carbon nuclei.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2566000'>And when I draw them in like that, you are going to see that</span>
  <span m='2572000'>all the valence orbitals of this system, except for two,</span>
  <span m='2578000'>lie in that x,y-plane. And the two that lie out of</span> <span
  m='2584000'>that x,y-plane, I will show you here,</span> <span m='2588000'>are p
  orbitals that go above and below the plane.</span> </p><p><span m='2594000'>And
  I am shading in the negative phase lobe of these pz</span> <span m='2600000'>orbitals.
  This is pz from carbon A and</span> <span m='2604000'>this is a pz from carbon B.
  And you can see that these are</span> <span m='2610000'>oriented in a side-on fashion,
  so that the overlap area that</span> <span m='2615000'>can occur is a side-to-side
  overlap of two neighboring P</span> <span m='2620000'>orbitals, like this. And the
  distinguishing feature</span> <span m='2624000'>here, as compared to my description
  of the sigma bond</span> <span m='2629000'>over there, is that it is not cylindrically
  symmetric.</span> </p><p><span m='2635000'>This bond has a nodal surface, which
  is the x,y-plane,</span> <span m='2641000'>where the phase changes as you pass from
  above that plane to</span> <span m='2649000'>below that plane. We have a nodal surface,</span>
  <span m='2654000'>a node containing the internuclear axis.</span> </p><p><span m='2659000'>The
  type of bond that I have drawn there is distinct from a</span> <span m='2667000'>sigma
  bond. It is a pi bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2677000'>That bond over there, the
  sigma bond,</span> <span m='2679000'>has no nodal surfaces passing through the internuclear
  axis.</span> </p><p><span m='2682000'>If I draw the internuclear axis here, you
  can see that it has</span> <span m='2686000'>the same phase no matter where you
  are with respect to that</span> <span m='2690000'>axis. Plus, plus, plus everywhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2692000'>And here, if these lobes of these two pz orbitals are</span>
  <span m='2695000'>considered to be positive in the positive z direction,</span>
  <span m='2698000'>then as we go this way, we pass through the x,y-plane</span> <span
  m='2702000'>and get down into negative z. We now have negative phase,</span> <span
  m='2706000'>as indicated by the purple shading down here.</span> </p><p><span m='2710000'>The
  fact that that happens only once with respect to this</span> <span m='2714000'>internuclear
  axis is what tells us that it is a pi bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2718000'>If there
  were two such nodal surfaces, then we would have a</span> <span m='2722000'>delta
  bond, and so on. And next time,</span> <span m='2724000'>we are going to start talking
  about the progression from these</span> <span m='2729000'>ideas onto hybridization.
  And then from there onto</span> <span m='2733743'>molecular orbital theory.</span>
