  information about our license and MIT</span> <span m='10000'>OpenCourseWare in general
  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>We were talking about
  the energies of the various states</span> <span m='20000'>in a multi-electron atom.
  And the question is,</span> <span m='25000'>how do we know what these energies are,</span>
  <span m='29000'>experimentally? And the technique that we use</span> <span m='34000'>to
  know those energies is something called photoelectron</span> <span m='39000'>spectroscopy.
  In principle,</span> <span m='41000'>it is the same kind of spectroscopy as when
  we talked</span> <span m='46000'>about photoemission from a solid, the photoelectron
  effect</span> <span m='51000'>explained by Einstein. And, by the way,</span> <span
  m='54000'>I put on the website an article that is really very clear about</span>
  <span m='59000'>what Einstein's contributions were.</span> </p><p><span m='64000'>In
  particular, in explaining the photoelectric</span> <span m='67000'>effect. And it
  has some sociology in</span> <span m='70000'>it, too. It is a really easy-to-read</span>
  <span m='72000'>article. I encourage you to take a look</span> <span m='75000'>at
  it as a study break sometime. Anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='78000'>The idea here
  is the same, the photoelectron spectroscopy</span> <span m='83000'>off of atoms
  and molecules. It is the same thing as the</span> <span m='88000'>photoelectron
  emission from a solid, in that you send in a</span> <span m='93000'>photon and that
  causes an electron to be ejected.</span> </p><p><span m='97000'>But, unlike the
  solid where we essentially had just one state</span> <span m='102000'>at a particular
  energy, in an atom or a molecule,</span> <span m='106000'>we have many different
  states with many different energies.</span> </p><p><span m='111000'>And what we
  typically do, then, is we send in a photon</span> <span m='116000'>that will be
  able to ionize all of those electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='122000'>That is, it
  is a photon with enough energy to rip off even</span> <span m='127000'>the most
  strongly bound electron.</span> </p><p><span m='129000'>And so, that photon is typically
  an X-ray photon.</span> </p><p><span m='134000'>For example, we take this unsuspecting
  neon</span> <span m='138000'>atom, and we bring in an X-ray photon and make neon
  plus.</span> </p><p><span m='142000'>And one of the electrons that</span> <span
  m='146000'>can come off is, of course, the 2p electron,</span> <span m='150000'>here,
  so that the ion configuration is</span> <span m='154000'>1s 2 2s 2 2p 5. And then,
  of course,</span> <span m='159000'>another possible electron to be pulled off is
  that 2s electron.</span> </p><p><span m='164000'>The electron configuration is 1s
  2 2s 1 2p 6.</span> </p><p><span m='168000'>And then, finally,</span> <span m='170000'>if
  the photon has enough energy, we can pull off the 1s</span> <span m='175000'>electron,
  to make the 1s 1 2s 2 configuration,</span> <span m='178000'>2s 2p6 configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='183000'>And what we then do in this technique is we measure the</span>
  <span m='187000'>kinetic energies of all the electrons that come off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='191000'>We measure the kinetic energies and disperse them so that we get</span>
  <span m='196000'>a plot of the number of electrons with a particular</span> <span
  m='200000'>kinetic energy. The plot is what I show you</span> <span m='203000'>here,
  number of electrons versus the kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='209000'>And
  what you see is that we have three kinetic energies that</span> <span m='214000'>show
  up. We have electrons with three</span> <span m='217000'>different kinetic energies.
  We have three different kinetic</span> <span m='222000'>energies because in neon,
  we had three states with</span> <span m='226000'>different energies. So, for example,</span>
  <span m='230000'>this energy, 384 eV, that corresponds to the</span> <span m='233000'>electrons
  that were pulled off, electrons that were in that 1s</span> <span m='239000'>state.
  That is the most strongly bound</span> <span m='243000'>state. For example,</span>
  <span m='244000'>if this is the energy of our incident photon,</span> <span m='247000'>and
  then this is the ionization energy, which is going to be</span> <span m='250000'>largest
  for the 1s electron because it is most strongly</span> <span m='254000'>bound, well,
  then, the energy difference between</span> <span m='257000'>the incident energy
  and that ionization energy is the kinetic</span> <span m='261000'>energy of the
  electron. That is the leftover energy</span> <span m='264000'>that goes into the
  kinetic energy of the electron.</span> </p><p><span m='269000'>That is going to
  be smallest because that 1s electron is most</span> <span m='273000'>strongly bound.
  Then we have this kinetic</span> <span m='276000'>energy here, electrons with that
  kinetic energy were electrons</span> <span m='280000'>sitting in the 2s state. That
  has higher kinetic energy</span> <span m='284000'>because they are less strongly
  bound.</span> </p><p><span m='287000'>This is the energy of the incident photon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290000'>This is the ionization energy of that 2s electron.</span>
  </p><p><span m='293000'>That leftover energy, then, is that kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='297000'>And then, finally, this is the feature that</span> <span
  m='300000'>represents the electrons in the 2p state.</span> </p><p><span m='305000'>They
  are least strongly bound. If this is the incident energy,</span> <span m='309000'>this
  is that ionization energy for the 2p state.</span> </p><p><span m='313000'>All of
  this energy is leftover to go into kinetic energy of</span> <span m='317000'>that
  2p electron moving away from the atom.</span> </p><p><span m='321000'>And so, in
  general, as the kinetic energy goes up,</span> <span m='324000'>the binding energy
  here is getting less and less negative.</span> </p><p><span m='330000'>It is getting
  weaker and weaker.</span> </p><p><span m='332000'>Or, in other words, as the kinetic
  energy goes up,</span> <span m='335000'>the binding energy is getting more negative
  in this direction.</span> </p><p><span m='339000'>Very quickly, if you look at a
  photoelectron</span> <span m='342000'>spectrum and you see three lines like this,
  you know you have</span> <span m='347000'>three states at three different energies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='350000'>And you always know that the highest kinetic energy means
  the</span> <span m='354000'>least strongly bound electron, the lowest kinetic energy
  means</span> <span m='358000'>the most strongly bound electron.</span> </p><p><span
  m='362000'>And then, we can use these results to actually calculate</span> <span
  m='365000'>the binding energies of the electrons by conservation of</span> <span
  m='369000'>energy. And this you have to know for</span> <span m='372000'>the exam.
  Incident energy is that</span> <span m='374000'>ionization energy or the work function,
  in the case of the</span> <span m='378000'>solid, plus the kinetic energy. Or, I
  can turn this around.</span> </p><p><span m='382000'>I can solve for the ionization
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='385000'>That will be the incident energy, which is
  right here.</span> </p><p><span m='390000'>This is the energy of that X-ray photon,</span>
  <span m='393000'>1,253 eV, minus the kinetic energies that we actually</span> <span
  m='397000'>measure, which are going to give us those ionization energies for</span>
  <span m='402000'>each one of the electrons in their corresponding state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='406000'>And then, once we have those ionization energies,</span>
  <span m='410000'>it is easy to turn it into a binding energy because that</span>
  <span m='414000'>ionization energy is equal to minus that binding energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='420000'>For example, since the ionization energy,</span> <span m='424000'>the
  1s electron, is 870 eV, the binding energy</span> <span m='428000'>of that 1s electron
  is minus eV.</span> </p><p><span m='432000'>And I also want you to notice just how
  much more strongly</span> <span m='437000'>bound that electron in the 1s state is
  compared to the</span> <span m='443000'>electrons in the n equals 2 shell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='446000'>That is because that n equals 1 shell is much closer in
  to the</span> <span m='452000'>nucleus, where that attractive interaction is much
  stronger.</span> </p><p><span m='460000'>And, therefore, this electron is much more</span>
  <span m='462000'>strongly bound than those electrons in the n equals 2</span> <span
  m='466000'>state. Of course, 2s is lower in</span> <span m='468000'>energy than
  2p, and that is important.</span> </p><p><span m='470000'>This is because in the
  2s state, you have a finite</span> <span m='474000'>probability of being really
  close to the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='477000'>That is what makes that 2s
  a little bit lower in energy than</span> <span m='481000'>the 2p. Now, what we are
  going to do is</span> <span m='487000'>I am going to start lecturing about trends
  in the Periodic</span> <span m='494000'>Table, and this is where the questions come
  for your section.</span> </p><p><span m='502000'>Oh, okay. Do you have any extra
  paper?</span> </p><p><span m='507000'>Not much. Well, the way you were going to</span>
  <span m='512000'>be able to answer a question for your recitation was by making
  a</span> <span m='518000'>paper airplane and launching it to the blackboard after
  I say</span> <span m='523000'>launch. And the first paper airplane to</span> <span
  m='526000'>hit the blackboard, well, you will have the</span> <span m='530000'>opportunity
  to answer the question.</span> </p><p><span m='533000'>Your recitation will have
  that opportunity to answer the</span> <span m='538000'>question. And we will keep
  score.</span> </p><p><span m='542000'>Now, we are kind of running out of extra paper.</span>
  </p><p><span m='547000'>You can take the one page that asks for the seating plan
  that</span> <span m='554000'>you will not need again, as a piece of paper to make
  an</span> <span m='560000'>airplane. Do you have any other paper?</span> </p><p><span
  m='565000'>Here are a couple of extra pages.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>Also,
  if you need some, there are some paper airplanes</span> <span m='574000'>up here.
  You are welcome to take those.</span> </p><p><span m='584000'>Okay. Some of you
  are more</span> <span m='586000'>strategically placed than others, and so you may
  want to</span> <span m='591000'>designate someone in your recitation section as
  a launcher</span> <span m='596000'>and send them down here so that everybody gets
  an equal chance.</span> </p><p><span m='603000'>That is fine with me. And, as I
  said,</span> <span m='606000'>if anybody wants a paper airplane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='609000'>Oh, also the other thing, write your recitation section</span> <span
  m='613000'>number on the airplane so that I can identify which airplane and</span>
  <span m='619000'>what section it comes from. And they have to be airplanes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='624000'>They cannot be wads. And here are some extra</span> <span
  m='628000'>airplanes if you want.</span> </p><p><span m='639000'>You can take some
  and pass them back if you want.</span> </p><p><span m='643000'>While you are doing
  that, I am going to start lecturing</span> <span m='648000'>here about trends in
  the Periodic Table.</span> </p><p><span m='663000'>And, of course, it is these electron</span>
  <span m='665000'>configurations that allow us to understand the trends in the</span>
  <span m='669000'>Periodic Table. But you should realize that the</span> <span m='673000'>Periodic
  Table was initially put together by Mendeleev and others</span> <span m='678000'>in
  1850-1870. And it was put together on the</span> <span m='681000'>basis of the similarity
  of the chemical and physical properties</span> <span m='685000'>of the elements.
  For example,</span> <span m='688000'>lithium, sodium, potassium, they were put in
  the</span> <span m='692000'>same column because those elements are all soft,</span>
  <span m='696000'>malleable elements that were very reactive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='699000'>Helium, neon, argon were put in the same</span> <span m='703000'>column
  because they are all atoms that are very unreactive.</span> </p><p><span m='707000'>And,
  of course, today, we understand why their</span> <span m='711000'>properties are
  what they are. And we understand it on the</span> <span m='715000'>basis of the
  electron configurations.</span> </p><p><span m='720000'>Lithium, sodium, potassium,
  we have this extra</span> <span m='723000'>valence electron in the s state that
  makes it very reactive.</span> </p><p><span m='729000'>Helium, neon, argon are very
  unreactive</span> <span m='732000'>because they have this closed shell, this inner
  gas</span> <span m='737000'>configuration. But really, by the late 1800s</span>
  <span m='740000'>and early 1900s, the similar chemical</span> <span m='744000'>properties,
  as you go down a column of the Periodic Table,</span> <span m='749000'>was really
  very firmly believed to an extreme extent.</span> </p><p><span m='755000'>So strongly,
  that it was known that,</span> <span m='758000'>and, of course, human beings ate
  salt and that</span> <span m='763000'>the body had sodium ions in it and potassium
  ions in it,</span> <span m='768000'>if that is the case, if you can consume sodium
  and</span> <span m='773000'>potassium, why not a little lithium?</span> </p><p><span
  m='778000'>In 1925 or so, there was marketed a soft</span> <span m='781000'>drink,
  and this soft drink wanted a lemon-lime flavor to</span> <span m='785000'>it. To
  get that lemon-lime flavor</span> <span m='788000'>they needed a little bit of citric
  acid, but that is not</span> <span m='792000'>very soluble in water. To make it
  soluble you make it</span> <span m='797000'>a salt. And, for whatever reason,</span>
  <span m='799000'>they used lithium citrate. Why not?</span> </p><p><span m='802000'>Let's
  use some lithium citrate. And that soft drink was none</span> <span m='807000'>other
  than 7-Up. Honestly.</span> </p><p><span m='811000'>And, in fact, the benefits of
  lithium were</span> <span m='816000'>touted. Lithium was claimed to give the</span>
  <span m='820000'>beverage healthful benefits, an abundance of energy,</span> <span
  m='826000'>enthusiasm, clear complexion, lustrous hair,</span> <span m='831000'>lustrous
  eyes, shinning eyes,</span> <span m='835000'>and you have got to drink this stuff.</span>
  </p><p><span m='841000'>It was the market for 25 years until the early 1950s,</span>
  <span m='845000'>when the antipsychotic properties of lithium were</span> <span
  m='849000'>beginning to be noticed, along with the severe side</span> <span m='854000'>effects
  of lithium. And it was then taken off the</span> <span m='858000'>market, or at
  least taken off the market with the citrate as</span> <span m='863000'>the lithium
  salt in it. And it was really only another</span> <span m='868000'>20 years, 1970,
  before lithium was actually</span> <span m='872000'>approved as a drug for the treatment
  of antipsychotic</span> <span m='876000'>behavior. I don't know how many</span>
  <span m='880000'>individuals suffered the side effects of lithium from drinking</span>
  <span m='884000'>too much 7-Up, but there is a moral to this</span> <span m='887000'>story.
  And the moral,</span> <span m='889000'>of course, is that even though we are about
  to talk about the</span> <span m='893000'>general trends along a column of a Periodic
  Table,</span> <span m='896000'>don't put any element in your mouth just because
  it is in the</span> <span m='900000'>same column of the Period Table as some element
  you do eat.</span> </p><p><span m='906000'>This is a for real story. One of the
  properties we are</span> <span m='911000'>going to talk about is the ionization
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='915000'>And we have already used the word ionization
  energy quite a</span> <span m='921000'>lot, but let me just formalize the definitions
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='927000'>For example, we have a boron atom being</span>
  <span m='930000'>ionized. The energy difference between</span> <span m='932000'>the
  products and the reactions here is that ionization energy.</span> </p><p><span m='937000'>But
  this ionization energy is minus the binding energy of the</span> <span m='942000'>2p
  electron in boron. That is what that ionization</span> <span m='946000'>energy is.
  We are ripping off the least</span> <span m='949000'>strongly bound electron. And
  when we rip off the least</span> <span m='953000'>strongly bound electron, we call
  that the first</span> <span m='957000'>ionization energy. That is the energy to
  remove</span> <span m='962000'>the electron from the highest occupied atomic orbital.</span>
  </p><p><span m='966000'>That is the same idea, the highest occupied atomic</span>
  <span m='970000'>orbital, that is the same idea as the least strongly bound</span>
  <span m='974000'>electron. However, most of the time,</span> <span m='977000'>when
  we talk about ionization energy, we don't use the word</span> <span m='982000'>first.
  If you see a list of ionization</span> <span m='985000'>energies, if you see a table
  of ionization energies,</span> <span m='989000'>they don't say first. That first
  is implied.</span> </p><p><span m='993000'>Now, of course, there are other kinds
  of</span> <span m='996000'>ionization energies. For example,</span> <span m='999000'>the
  second ionization energy. We can keep going here.</span> </p><p><span m='1003000'>We
  can take boron plus, rip off the next least strongly</span> <span m='1007000'>bound
  electron to make boron plus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='1011000'>That energy change
  is what we define as a second ionization</span> <span m='1015000'>energy. That second
  ionization energy</span> <span m='1018000'>is minus the binding energy of the 2s
  electron in boron plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1022000'>And we can keep going.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1024000'>There is a third ionization energy, taking another electron</span>
  <span m='1028000'>from boron plus 2 to boron plus 3.</span> </p><p><span m='1031000'>And
  there is a fourth ionization energy,</span> <span m='1034000'>boron plus 3 to boron
  plus 4.</span> </p><p><span m='1037000'>And a fifth ionization energy, boron plus
  4,</span> <span m='1040000'>boron plus 5, all the way down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1043000'>And now we are the bare nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='1045000'>That
  is our definition of ionization energy,</span> <span m='1048000'>second, third,
  fourth, and fifth.</span> </p><p><span m='1052000'>Now comes the first question,
  and the question is going to be</span> <span m='1058000'>on the side boards here.
  We have this reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1063000'>This is boron plus going
  to boron plus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='1070000'>What we are doing here is removing
  a 2s electron.</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>[LAUGHTER] Remember about the</span>
  <span m='1082000'>fool aiming for their chemistry professor?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1096000'>Look at the second reaction here, boron to boron plus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1100000'>Again, we are pulling off a 2s</span> <span m='1103000'>electron. And
  the question is,</span> <span m='1106000'>are these two energies equal? Now, the
  way we are going to</span> <span m='1110000'>answer it is after I get out of the
  way, I am going to say</span> <span m='1114000'>launch. You are going to launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1116000'>And the first paper airplane to hit the blackboard,</span>
  <span m='1119000'>we are going to look at that recitation number and you are</span>
  <span m='1122000'>going to have a chance to answer.</span> </p><p><span m='1124000'>Are
  you ready? Launch.</span> </p><p><span m='1135000'>Recitation four. Are these two
  energies equal?</span> </p><p><span m='1140000'>That is you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1148000'>Are these two energies equal? No.</span> </p><p><span m='1150000'>Final
  answer? Yes, they are right.</span> </p><p><span m='1153000'>One point for recitation
  four. These energies are not equal.</span> </p><p><span m='1159000'>Why? Well, because
  this ionization</span> <span m='1162000'>energy is the second ionization energy.
  It is</span> <span m='1165000'>minus the binding energy of the 2s electron in boron
  plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1171000'>This energy is the ionization</span> <span
  m='1176000'>energy of the 2s electron in boron.</span> </p><p><span m='1179000'>It
  is minus the binding energy of the 2s electron in boron.</span> </p><p><span m='1186000'>They
  are not equal. Next question.</span> </p><p><span m='1189000'>Which one of these
  binding energies is greater?</span> </p><p><span m='1194000'>Wait. I am getting
  out of the way.</span> </p><p><span m='1198000'>Are you ready? In position.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1202000'>Launch.</span> </p><p><span m='1209000'>Recitation eight.
  Where are you,</span> <span m='1212000'>eight? You are over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1216000'>Eight does not want to identify itself.</span> </p><p><span m='1220000'>All
  right. Which one is greater,</span> <span m='1224000'>top or bottom? Top.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1227000'>Final answer? Boy, you are right.</span> </p><p><span m='1232000'>Top
  one is greater. Recitation eight.</span> </p><p><span m='1236000'>It is greater
  because the effective charge in boron plus</span> <span m='1243000'>is larger than
  it is in boron. There are fewer electrons for</span> <span m='1250000'>shielding.
  The effective charge is larger.</span> </p><p><span m='1255000'>That binding energy
  is greater. Or, that ionization energy</span> <span m='1262000'>here, the way I
  write it, is greater.</span> </p><p><span m='1266000'>Fantastic. Now, we are going
  to look at</span> <span m='1270000'>some trends in the ionization energy along the
  Periodic Table.</span> </p><p><span m='1277000'>The first question is, here is the
  Periodic Table,</span> <span m='1282000'>as we go across it, what happens to that
  ionization</span> <span m='1288000'>energy? Wait.</span> </p><p><span m='1291000'>Are
  we in position? Ready?</span> </p><p><span m='1296000'>Launch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1305000'>Recitation five. What happens to the ionization</span> <span m='1309000'>energy
  as you go across the Periodic Table?</span> </p><p><span m='1314000'>Is that five?
  Is that your answer,</span> <span m='1317000'>five?</span> </p><p><span m='1325000'>What
  happens to the ionization energy as you go across the</span> <span m='1331000'>Periodic
  Table from here to here?</span> </p><p><span m='1335000'>It increases. You are right,</span>
  <span m='1338000'>recitation five. Here is the trend.</span> </p><p><span m='1342000'>Here
  is row one, from hydrogen to helium.</span> </p><p><span m='1346000'>Here is row
  two, from lithium to neon.</span> </p><p><span m='1352000'>It increases. It increases
  because,</span> <span m='1355000'>as you go across the Periodic Table here, Z increases.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1361000'>The nuclear charge increases. But, of course,</span> <span
  m='1365000'>there is another parameter here, and that is r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1370000'>But, as you go across the Periodic Table right here,</span> <span m='1375000'>you
  are putting electrons into the same shell,</span> <span m='1380000'>essentially.
  You are putting those electrons</span> <span m='1385000'>into shells that have,
  roughly speaking,</span> <span m='1389000'>the same distance of r from the nucleus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1392000'>And so the factor that wins out is Z, the effective charge
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1398000'>And the ionization energy as you go across
  then increases.</span> </p><p><span m='1403000'>But you also see that there are
  some glitches.</span> </p><p><span m='1407000'>You see that boron is a little bit
  lower energy than --</span> <span m='1418000'>What did I want to say here? I'm sorry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1422000'>I am looking at it from the side.</span> </p><p><span m='1426000'>Here
  is the electron configuration of beryllium.</span> </p><p><span m='1431000'>Here
  it is, boron, Z equals 5.</span> </p><p><span m='1442000'>What you see, here, is
  that in boron,</span> <span m='1444000'>you have to put that extra electron into
  the 2p state,</span> <span m='1449000'>which requires some more energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1451000'>The bottom line is that the nuclear charge does not increase</span>
  <span m='1456000'>fast enough to compensate completely for the extra energy</span>
  <span m='1460000'>that you need to have to get to this 2p state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1464000'>Boron has a little bit lower ionization energy than</span> <span m='1468000'>beryllium.
  And to see another glitch,</span> <span m='1472000'>that other glitch is between
  nitrogen and oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='1477000'>Again, we can understand that
  glitch by the electron</span> <span m='1483000'>configuration. Here is nitrogen,</span>
  <span m='1486000'>Z equals 7. Here is oxygen,</span> <span m='1489000'>Z equals
  8. And the bottom line here is</span> <span m='1493000'>that in oxygen, you have
  to put an electron in</span> <span m='1497000'>a state in which there already is
  an electron.</span> </p><p><span m='1504000'>That is a repulsive interaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1506000'>Again, the increase in the nuclear charge just is not large</span>
  <span m='1511000'>enough to fully compensate for that repulsive interaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1516000'>We can understand those little glitches in terms of these</span>
  <span m='1521000'>electron configurations. And, in general,</span> <span m='1524000'>here,
  that ionization increases as we go across the Periodic</span> <span m='1529000'>Table.
  Here is the third row.</span> </p><p><span m='1532000'>You also see there are glitches
  in the third row.</span> </p><p><span m='1536000'>You see there is a glitch between
  magnesium and aluminum.</span> </p><p><span m='1541000'>They are right underneath
  beryllium and boron.</span> </p><p><span m='1545000'>A glitch between phosphorous
  and sulfur.</span> </p><p><span m='1548000'>They are right underneath nitrogen and
  oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='1551000'>For the same reason, there is a glitch at
  those</span> <span m='1555000'>elements in the second row. Now, the next question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1561000'>As we go down a column of the Periodic Table,</span> <span
  m='1569000'>what happens to the ionization energy?</span> </p><p><span m='1576000'>Wait.
  Ready?</span> </p><p><span m='1578000'>Set? Launch.</span> </p><p><span m='1580000'>Five.
  What happens to the ionization</span> <span m='1586000'>energy? What?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1590000'>Decreases. You are right,</span> <span m='1593000'>recitation five.
  Why does it decrease?</span> </p><p><span m='1597000'>It decreases because? Well,
  it decreases because you</span> <span m='1603000'>are putting electrons into shells
  that are farther and</span> <span m='1610000'>farther away from the nucleus. Yes,
  as you go down the column,</span> <span m='1617000'>Z increases. But it does not
  increase fast</span> <span m='1622000'>enough as r increases. Remember there are
  the two</span> <span m='1627000'>factors, Z and r. Although Z increases,</span>
  <span m='1631000'>you are putting the electrons into shells that are farther</span>
  <span m='1637000'>from the nucleus. Therefore, that attractive</span> <span m='1641000'>interaction
  does go down, and the ionization energy goes</span> <span m='1646000'>down. Great.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1649000'>Now, we are going to talk about another property.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1653000'>That other property is called the electron affinity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1658000'>For example, if I take chlorine and add an</span> <span
  m='1662000'>electron to it to make chlorine minus.</span> </p><p><span m='1666000'>There
  is an energy change here. That energy change,</span> <span m='1671000'>delta E,
  is equal to minus kilojoules per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1676000'>That is,
  the fact that this</span> <span m='1682000'>energy change is negative, this tells
  you that the</span> <span m='1688000'>chlorine ion is more stable than the neutral
  atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1693000'>Now, in terms of an equation, what is the
  definition here of</span> <span m='1699000'>the electron affinity? That is the next
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='1704000'>Are you ready to launch? Launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1714000'>Recitation eight. Where are you?</span> </p><p><span m='1716000'>You
  are right here. No, you are right there.</span> </p><p><span m='1719000'>Recitation
  eight, what is the definition of the</span> <span m='1723000'>electron affinity?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1730000'>TAs cannot help. Energy required to add an</span> <span
  m='1735000'>electron, that is --</span> <span m='1749000'>Recitation eight, you
  are right.</span> </p><p><span m='1752000'>It is minus delta E. Fantastic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1756000'>This is the delta E for the reason.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1760000'>The electron affinity is minus that quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='1765000'>The
  electron affinity, then, of chlorine is</span> <span m='1770000'>kilojoules per
  mole. Now, unlike the ionization</span> <span m='1776000'>energy, the electron affinity
  can be positive or negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1782000'>For example, if you
  try to stick an electron</span> <span m='1787000'>on a nitrogen atom to make N minus,</span>
  <span m='1792000'>delta E for that reaction is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1796000'>It
  is 7 kilojoules per mole. And so that electron is not</span> <span m='1802000'>going
  to stick onto the nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='1806000'>The electron affinity
  in that case is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1811000'>It is minus 7 kilojoules
  per mole.</span> </p><p><span m='1814000'>Again, you can understand that in terms
  of the electron</span> <span m='1820000'>configuration for the nitrogen. Here is
  the electron</span> <span m='1825000'>configuration for nitrogen. If you go and
  you want to add</span> <span m='1832000'>in another electron, like right there,</span>
  <span m='1835000'>there is a repulsive interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='1837000'>And
  Z equals 7. In this case,</span> <span m='1839000'>that nuclear charge is not large
  enough to compensate for</span> <span m='1844000'>this repulsive interaction, so
  the electron affinity,</span> <span m='1848000'>here, is negative. Noble gases have
  negative</span> <span m='1851000'>electron affinities. You cannot add an electron
  to</span> <span m='1855000'>that. It is not stable.</span> </p><p><span m='1857000'>Why?
  Because you are destroying,</span> <span m='1862000'>in effect, the electronic configuration
  of the rare gas.</span> </p><p><span m='1870000'>With that, now we want to ask is
  how does the electron</span> <span m='1877000'>affinity change as you go across
  the periodic table?</span> </p><p><span m='1883000'>That is our next question. Wait.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1888000'>Okay. Ready?</span> </p><p><span m='1891000'>Set? Launch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1901000'>Six, where are you? What happens to the electron</span>
  <span m='1907000'>affinity as you go across the Periodic Table,</span> <span m='1912000'>from
  left to right? Decreases.</span> </p><p><span m='1916000'>Is that your final answer?
  Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1921000'>You are wrong. The electron affinity,</span>
  <span m='1925000'>as you go across, increases.</span> </p><p><span m='1928000'>The
  halogens, fluorine, chlorine have very</span> <span m='1932000'>large electron affinities,
  because adding an electron</span> <span m='1937000'>gives you that noble gas configuration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1941000'>The electron affinity increases as you go across the Periodic</span>
  <span m='1948000'>Table. Now what happens to the</span> <span m='1951000'>electron
  affinity as we go down the Periodic Table?</span> </p><p><span m='1955000'>You guys,
  do you have any paper airplanes?</span> </p><p><span m='1959000'>We have to give
  you some. Are you okay?</span> </p><p><span m='1962000'>That is our next question.
  What happens to the electron</span> <span m='1966000'>affinity as we go down the
  Periodic Table?</span> </p><p><span m='1969000'>Ready? Set?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1970000'>Launch.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>Recitation four. What does it
  do?</span> </p><p><span m='1983000'>Does it go down? Decreases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1986000'>It absolutely does.</span> </p><p><span m='1994000'>The electron affinity,
  as you go down,</span> <span m='1997000'>decreases. It decreases because the</span>
  <span m='2001000'>nuclear charge, here, is increasing,</span> <span m='2005000'>but
  you are putting electrons in shells that are farther away</span> <span m='2011000'>from
  the nucleus. The overall effect is that that</span> <span m='2017000'>r dependence
  dictates, and the electron affinity goes</span> <span m='2022000'>down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2028000'>Let me do one more here. Or, maybe a couple more.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2034000'>Now, what I want to ask is about the atomic radius.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2047000'>And what I want to know is what happens to r as you go across</span>
  <span m='2055000'>the Periodic Table. I am getting out of the way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2061000'>Wait. Ready?</span> </p><p><span m='2062000'>Set? I haven't said launch
  yet.</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>Ready? Set?</span> </p><p><span m='2068000'>Go.
  Recitation one.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>What happens to r? Decreases.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2076000'>It decreases. It goes down.</span> </p><p><span m='2080000'>This
  is important. It goes down,</span> <span m='2084000'>here, because Z is increasing.
  Z is increasing,</span> <span m='2091000'>and you are putting electrons into the
  same shell.</span> </p><p><span m='2100000'>And so the same shell means the same
  distance from the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='2107000'>Larger Z, the radius
  actually goes down, the size goes down.</span> </p><p><span m='2113000'>And then,
  one more question. What happens as you go down the</span> <span m='2120000'>Periodic
  Table? I am going to get out of the</span> <span m='2125000'>way. Ready?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2126000'>Set? Go.</span> </p><p><span m='2134000'>One. It decreases?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2145000'>What did you say? Increases.</span> </p><p><span m='2162000'>It
  does increase because you are putting electrons into</span> <span m='2197000'>shells
  farther and farther away. What is the score,</span> <span m='2230158'>Christine?
  Fantastic.</span> </p>
