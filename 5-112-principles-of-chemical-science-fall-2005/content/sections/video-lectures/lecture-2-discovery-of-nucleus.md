  </p><p><span m='15000'>Great. Well, let's get going.</span> </p><p><span m='17000'>Last
  time we ended up by discovering the electron.</span> </p><p><span m='22000'>We discovered
  the fact that the atom was not the most basic</span> <span m='27000'>constituent
  of matter. But in 1911 there was another</span> <span m='33000'>discovery concerning
  the atom, and this is by Ernest</span> <span m='38000'>Rutherford in England. And
  what Rutherford was</span> <span m='43000'>interested in doing was studying the
  emission from the newly</span> <span m='49000'>discovered radioactive elements such
  as radium.</span> </p><p><span m='54000'>And so he borrowed, or he got, from Marie
  Curie,</span> <span m='59000'>some radium bromide. And radium bromide was known
  to</span> <span m='65000'>emit something called alpha particles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='69000'>And they didn't really know what these alpha particles were.</span> </p><p><span
  m='74000'>Now, they did know that the alpha particles were heavy,</span> <span m='80000'>they
  were charged and that they were pretty energetic.</span> </p><p><span m='84000'>That
  is what was known. Of course, today we know these</span> <span m='90000'>alpha particles
  to be nothing other than helium with two</span> <span m='94000'>electrons removed
  from the helium, helium double plus.</span> </p><p><span m='98000'>Rutherford is
  in the lab and has this radium bromide,</span> <span m='102000'>alpha particles
  being emitted and has some kind of detector</span> <span m='107000'>out here to
  detect those alpha particles.</span> </p><p><span m='110000'>And he measures a rate
  at which the alpha particles touch his</span> <span m='115000'>detector. And it
  is about 132,000 alpha</span> <span m='120000'>particles per minute. That's nice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125000'>Then what he does is takes a piece of gold foil and puts
  it</span> <span m='132000'>in between the radium bromide emitter and the detector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='139000'>And that gold foil is actually really very thin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='146000'>It is 2x10^-5 inches. Two orders of magnitude thinner</span>
  <span m='152000'>than the diameter of your hair. I often wonder how he handled</span>
  <span m='158000'>that, but he did it. He put it in the middle here</span> <span
  m='162000'>and then went to count the count rate as a result of putting this</span>
  <span m='168000'>foil there, and the count rate is 132,000 alpha particles per</span>
  <span m='174000'>minute. It didn't seem like that gold</span> <span m='177000'>foil
  did anything. The alpha particles were just</span> <span m='182000'>going right
  through to the detector.</span> </p><p><span m='185000'>It didn't even seem to matter
  that there was that gold foil.</span> </p><p><span m='189000'>The post-doc that
  was working on it, Geiger,</span> <span m='193000'>of the Geiger Counter, was actually
  disappointed.</span> </p><p><span m='196000'>Gee, that is a boring experiment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199000'>But Geiger was even a little bit more unhappy because he
  had</span> <span m='203000'>this undergraduate hanging around the lab,</span> <span
  m='207000'>this undergraduate named Marsden.</span> </p><p><span m='211000'>And
  Marsden was really enthusiastic about doing</span> <span m='214000'>something in
  the lab. He really wanted to do</span> <span m='217000'>something. And Geiger, you
  know,</span> <span m='220000'>what am I going to do with this kid?</span> </p><p><span
  m='222000'>Geiger goes to Rutherford, look, this kid really wants to</span> <span
  m='227000'>do something. What should I have him do?</span> </p><p><span m='230000'>And
  Rutherford said, well, what you should have him</span> <span m='233000'>do is take
  this detector and have him build it so that it can</span> <span m='238000'>be swung
  around. So that it can be positioned</span> <span m='243000'>here. So that we can
  check to see</span> <span m='245000'>whether or not any of these alpha particles
  are</span> <span m='249000'>backscattered, scattered back into the</span> <span
  m='252000'>direction from which they came. And Geiger went away and</span> <span
  m='257000'>thought, good, this is something to give the</span> <span m='260000'>undergraduate.
  This is a ridiculous</span> <span m='263000'>experiment. We know all the particles
  are</span> <span m='267000'>going right through the detector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='271000'>Okay. But Marsden was real happy.</span> </p><p><span m='273000'>He gets
  to build this detector. He swings it around and gets</span> <span m='278000'>Geiger
  there to do the first experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='281000'>He puts the radium
  bromide and they listen and hear tick,</span> <span m='285000'>tick, tick, tick,
  tick, tick.</span> </p><p><span m='288000'>Geiger says, "Oh, it must just be</span>
  <span m='290000'>background. Let me do a control experiment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='293000'>Let me take the gold foil out of here so that all the</span> <span m='298000'>particles
  have to be going in this direction."</span> <span m='303000'>They take the gold
  foil out of there and listen,</span> <span m='307000'>and they hear nothing. They
  put the gold foil back and</span> <span m='312000'>they hear tick, tick, tick, tick,</span>
  <span m='314000'>tick, tick. And they put a platinum foil in</span> <span m='318000'>there
  and they hear tick, tick, tick, tick,</span> <span m='322000'>tick, tick. Whatever
  metal they put in</span> <span m='325000'>there, there were some particles coming
  off.</span> </p><p><span m='331000'>And they got Rutherford down in the lab.</span>
  </p><p><span m='335000'>Rutherford looks them over their shoulder.</span> </p><p><span
  m='339000'>They do this again and again. Hey, it is real.</span> </p><p><span m='344000'>It
  is real. And what is coming off?</span> </p><p><span m='347000'>Well, the count
  rate is about 20 particles per minute.</span> </p><p><span m='353000'>Not large
  but not zero. And the probability here of</span> <span m='359000'>this backscattering
  is simply the number of particles</span> <span m='365000'>backscattered, which is
  20,</span> <span m='368000'>over the total number of particles, or actually the
  count</span> <span m='374000'>rate that the particles backscattered over the total</span>
  <span m='379000'>incident count rate. That is 2x10^-4.</span> </p><p><span m='383000'>That
  is not zero. Wow.</span> </p><p><span m='386000'>Rutherford was excited. Rutherford
  later wrote,</span> <span m='392000'>"It was quite the most incredible event that
  has ever</span> <span m='397000'>happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible
  as</span> <span m='402000'>if you fired a 15 inch shell at a piece of tissue paper
  and it</span> <span m='408000'>came back and hit you." What was the interpretation?</span>
  </p><p><span m='413000'>The interpretation was the gold atoms that make up this
  foil,</span> <span m='419000'>they must be mostly empty. Now, they knew that those
  atoms</span> <span m='425000'>had some electrons in it because the electron had
  already been</span> <span m='430000'>discovered. But these alpha particles seem</span>
  <span m='434000'>to be going right through those gold atoms, for the most part.</span>
  </p><p><span m='439000'>The atom, which he knew to be a diameter of about 10^-10
  meters,</span> <span m='444000'>most of that atom must be empty was the conclusion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='450000'>But occasionally these helium double plus ions,</span> <span
  m='455000'>these alpha particles, hit something massive.</span> </p><p><span m='460000'>And
  that something massive then scatters those helium ions into</span> <span m='466000'>the
  direction from which they came.</span> </p><p><span m='469000'>And since that probability
  is small, well, the size of this</span> <span m='475000'>massive part has to be
  really pretty small.</span> </p><p><span m='481000'>And from knowing the probabilities
  and knowing</span> <span m='485000'>roughly what the diameter of the atoms were
  and how many layers</span> <span m='491000'>of atoms he had, he was able to back
  out of</span> <span m='495000'>those experiments a diameter for this massive part
  of 10^-14</span> <span m='500000'>meters. And he called this massive part</span>
  <span m='504000'>the nucleus. He called it the nucleus in</span> <span m='508000'>analogy
  to the nucleus of a living cell.</span> </p><p><span m='513000'>The heavy part,
  the dense part in a living</span> <span m='516000'>cell-- that is where the name
  "nucleus" comes from.</span> </p><p><span m='521000'>Now, Rutherford also realized
  that this nucleus here has to be</span> <span m='526000'>positively charged. He
  knew about electrons and</span> <span m='530000'>knew the atoms then were neutral,
  and so he reasoned this</span> <span m='535000'>nucleus had to be positively charged.</span>
  </p><p><span m='540000'>And then he did a bunch more experiments, more sophisticated</span>
  <span m='545000'>experiments in which he actually measured here the angular</span>
  <span m='550000'>distribution of the helium ion scattered from the nucleus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='555000'>And from those very detailed measurements of the angular</span>
  <span m='560000'>distribution, he was able to back out the</span> <span m='564000'>fact
  that this nucleus, the charge on it was actually</span> <span m='568000'>plus Z
  times e. Z is the atomic number.</span> </p><p><span m='574000'>e is the unit charge.
  He did a bunch of different</span> <span m='578000'>metals and was able to establish
  that the nucleus had a charge of</span> <span m='583000'>plus Z times e. His model
  is that there is a</span> <span m='588000'>very dense center, 10^-14 meters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='590000'>This diameter of the nucleus is something that every MIT</span>
  <span m='595000'>undergraduate should know. And he realized that then the</span>
  <span m='601000'>electrons have to fill out the rest of this volume.</span> </p><p><span
  m='605000'>That was his interpretation from these results.</span> </p><p><span m='609000'>And
  think about Marsden, what a great UROP experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='614000'>He
  discovered the nucleus. Isn't that great?</span> </p><p><span m='617000'>Marsden
  had a long and successful career as a scientist</span> <span m='622000'>also after
  that. Now, I should also tell you</span> <span m='626000'>that this backscattering
  experiment is really the essence</span> <span m='631000'>of how a quark was discovered.
  Quark are the fundamental</span> <span m='636000'>elementary particles in protons
  and neutrons.</span> </p><p><span m='640000'>Essentially, they took a high energy</span>
  <span m='642000'>particle, scattered it through the proton or the neutron,</span>
  <span m='646000'>and it backscatters. And, in that way,</span> <span m='649000'>they
  discovered the quark and measured the diameter of the</span> <span m='653000'>quark.
  And this was done by a couple</span> <span m='655000'>of my colleagues in the Physics
  Department.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>Jerry Friedman and Henry Kendall, who
  has since passed</span> <span m='665000'>away. Jerry Friedman is still around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='669000'>He loves to talk to undergraduates,</span> <span m='673000'>and
  many of you will get that opportunity.</span> </p><p><span m='678000'>Now it is
  time for us to do our own Rutherford backscattering</span> <span m='684000'>experiment.
  Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='686000'>[APPLAUSE] Here is our gold lattice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='691000'>These Styrofoam balls are the gold nuclei.</span> </p><p><span
  m='695000'>The space around them are the electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='699000'>These
  things in the center here are just the posts on this</span> <span m='704000'>frame.
  [LAUGHTER] This is a piece of</span> <span m='708000'>equipment from my lab that
  I pressed into service,</span> <span m='712000'>and so I couldn't cut these posts
  away because I would have</span> <span m='718000'>trouble taking my manipulator
  out of my machine at a later</span> <span m='724000'>time. So they are just there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='728000'>But this is our one monolayer of gold nuclei.</span> </p><p><span
  m='731000'>And so what are we going to do? Well, what we are going to do</span>
  <span m='737000'>is try to measure the diameter of these Styrofoam balls in the</span>
  <span m='742000'>same way that Rutherford did. And so we are going to need</span>
  <span m='747000'>some alpha particles. What are we going to use for an</span> <span
  m='754000'>alpha particle? Well, we have some ping-pong</span> <span m='759000'>balls
  for alpha particles. Let's do that.</span> </p><p><span m='764000'>We have 287 alpha
  particles, or ping-pong balls,</span> <span m='771000'>and we are going to measure
  the probability of backscattering.</span> </p><p><span m='780000'>The probability
  of backscattering will be the</span> <span m='784000'>number that actually backscatter
  divided by the number that we</span> <span m='790000'>throw, or the total number.
  That is what we are going to</span> <span m='796000'>measure. But now I have to
  take this</span> <span m='799000'>probability and I have to relate it to the diameter
  of these</span> <span m='805000'>nuclei. How am I going to do that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='810000'>Well, that probability is going to be equal to the total surface</span>
  <span m='816000'>area of the crystal here. I have already measured the</span> <span
  m='822000'>total area. I know that the total area is</span> <span m='827000'>2,148
  square inches. That is in the denominator,</span> <span m='832000'>but now the numerator
  is simply the total area of the nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='840000'>The total
  area of the nuclei is the area of one nucleus,</span> <span m='845000'>A sub i,
  summed over the total number of</span> <span m='849000'>nuclei, which I have already
  counted as 119.</span> </p><p><span m='853000'>And so the total area is times the
  cross-sectional area</span> <span m='859000'>here of any one of these nuclei. And
  that is pi d squared over 4.</span> </p><p><span m='865000'>I can solve that equation,</span>
  <span m='870000'>for the diameter, in terms of the probability.</span> </p><p><span
  m='874000'>And when I solve that equation, d is equal to 4.79 times the</span> <span
  m='880000'>probability to the one-half power.</span> </p><p><span m='885000'>What
  we are going to do is measure this probability by</span> <span m='890000'>throwing
  the ping-pong balls and calculating and determining how</span> <span m='895000'>many
  backscatter. And then we are going to use</span> <span m='900000'>that to get this
  diameter of the nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='905000'>The same experiment that
  was done to actually measure the</span> <span m='909000'>diameter of the nucleus.
  Now you are going to do this</span> <span m='914000'>experiment. Every one of you
  are going to</span> <span m='918000'>get a ping-pong ball from the TAs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='921000'>TAs, why don't you give out the ping-pong balls,</span> <span m='925000'>and
  then I will give you some instructions.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>All right.
  The pi d squared over 4</span> <span m='934000'>is the cross-sectional area in terms
  of the diameter of</span> <span m='940000'>these balls. I just wrote it in terms
  of d</span> <span m='945000'>instead of r. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>That
  is correct. Good point.</span> </p><p><span m='962000'>That balls that we are throwing
  actually have size compared to</span> <span m='966000'>in the case of the Rutherford
  backscattering experiment where</span> <span m='971000'>the projectile was almost
  a point compared to the size of</span> <span m='975000'>the nucleus. In our experiment,</span>
  <span m='977000'>you are quite right, our balls are about the</span> <span m='980000'>diameter
  there. And so, if we were doing a more</span> <span m='984000'>exact experiment,
  we would do a little different</span> <span m='987000'>calculation. We would take
  into</span> <span m='991000'>consideration the size of the actual ball that we were</span>
  <span m='997000'>throwing. But we are not going to do</span> <span m='1000000'>that.
  Because we are not throwing</span> <span m='1003000'>that many balls, we don't really
  have the</span> <span m='1007000'>statistics to do a more exacting kind of calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1013000'>But you are quite right. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1025000'>Well,
  he didn't know. Although, he knew the fact that</span> <span m='1028000'>it was
  backscattering, that it had to be much,</span> <span m='1031000'>much less massive
  than the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='1033000'>I think that he also measured
  the energy of the backscattered</span> <span m='1038000'>particle. And from that,</span>
  <span m='1039000'>you can back out the fact that it is much less massive than the</span>
  <span m='1043000'>nucleus. There are a few other details,</span> <span m='1046000'>you
  are quite right, that I have left out in this</span> <span m='1049000'>discussion
  that he had to know in order to get this number.</span> </p><p><span m='1055000'>Here
  is the thing. You have to aim your alpha</span> <span m='1059000'>particles at this
  lattice. And then you have to watch your</span> <span m='1066000'>ball. [LAUGHTER]
  You have to watch to</span> <span m='1070000'>see if it scatters back at you, because
  at the end I am going</span> <span m='1076000'>to ask you if your ball backscattered.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1082000'>And we need an accurate count. Now, if you hit one of these</span>
  <span m='1087000'>things and it backscatters, that doesn't count.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1091000'>Only if it hits the Styrofoam ball does it count.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1096000'>If it hits the Styrofoam ball and goes through,</span> <span m='1100000'>that
  doesn't count. It literally has to backscatter</span> <span m='1105000'>at you.
  Was there a question over here?</span> </p><p><span m='1110000'>If you miss you
  miss. [LAUGHTER] Now,</span> <span m='1112000'>I do invite you to come a little
  closer so that you can at</span> <span m='1117000'>least hit the crystal. Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1127000'>That is correct. Well, you have got a defect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1130000'>These are a little bit lighter. Oh, you have some more here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1135000'>Oh, okay. You can have a regular one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1137000'>Anybody need one yet? I have a couple.</span> </p><p><span m='1141000'>Oh,
  all right. You need one?</span> </p><p><span m='1143000'>Because I need them all
  thrown. Did you have a question?</span> </p><p><span m='1153000'>What is the mean
  free path?</span> </p><p><span m='1160000'>That I am going to have to give you an
  expression for at some</span> <span m='1165000'>other time, but there is certainly
  a decay pathway.</span> </p><p><span m='1170000'>I have another ball here. Now,
  are you ready?</span> </p><p><span m='1175000'>You can come down closer, but now
  I have one piece of</span> <span m='1183000'>advice for you. That is, only fools
  aim for</span> <span m='1188000'>their chemistry professor. [LAUGHTER] Go to it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1253000'>Did you throw your balls? You missed the crystal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1260000'>All right. Has our supply of alpha</span> <span m='1265000'>particles
  been exhausted? All done?</span> </p><p><span m='1271000'>All right. [APPLAUSE]
  Now comes the big</span> <span m='1278000'>test. How many of you had an alpha</span>
  <span m='1283000'>particle that backscattered? Let's keep your hand high</span>
  <span m='1293000'>because I have to count accurately.</span> </p><p><span m='1297000'>In
  this section I see one. Two?</span> </p><p><span m='1302000'>Cheater. No.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1303000'>Two, three, four, five, six, seven,</span> <span m='1308000'>eight,
  nine, ten, eleven,</span> <span m='1311000'>twelve, thirteen. Did I get everybody?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1323000'>I got everybody? 13?</span> </p><p><span m='1324000'>Right,
  not deflection. If it hit and went through,</span> <span m='1329000'>that does not
  count. It has to come back at you.</span> </p><p><span m='1340000'>Yes. [LAUGHTER]
  That is right.</span> </p><p><span m='1343000'>All right. Does anybody want to change</span>
  <span m='1347000'>their count? 13 balls?</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>I am sorry?
  If it just hit it and moved but</span> <span m='1354000'>did not backscatter, it
  does not count.</span> </p><p><span m='1358000'>The nuclei will move. They will
  move,</span> <span m='1363000'>certainly, because there is a momentum transfer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1368000'>Well, not quite like that. No.</span> </p><p><span m='1371000'>We
  have 13 balls that backscattered?</span> </p><p><span m='1375000'>Okay. Let's see
  what we got.</span> </p><p><span m='1385000'>The probability, here, then, is 13
  over 287.</span> </p><p><span m='1393000'>That probability is equal to</span> <span
  m='1399000'>If I now that this probability and plug it into here,</span> <span m='1409000'>what
  we are going to get is a diameter of 1.0 inches.</span> </p><p><span m='1420000'>And
  the diameter on the average of those particles is about 0.85</span> <span m='1428000'>inches.
  You did a really pretty good</span> <span m='1432000'>job. You got the diameter
  of the</span> <span m='1436000'>nucleus. [APPLAUSE]</span> <span m='1440000'>That
  is great. And that is the way the nuclear</span> <span m='1444000'>diameter was,
  in fact, measured and</span> <span m='1447000'>discovered. But now we have the problem</span>
  <span m='1451000'>that the scientists had in 1912, and that is what is the</span>
  <span m='1456000'>structure of the atom? We now know it has a nucleus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1461000'>It has an electron. How do they hang together?</span> </p><p><span m='1465000'>Where
  are they in the atom? We are going to talk about the</span> <span m='1471000'>classical
  description here of the atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1475000'>And the first question
  that we have to ask is,</span> <span m='1479000'>what is the force that keeps the
  electron and the nucleus</span> <span m='1485000'>together? What are the four fundamental</span>
  <span m='1489000'>forces? Gravity is one.</span> </p><p><span m='1491000'>And that
  is the strongest or the weakest?</span> </p><p><span m='1495000'>Weakest. Gravity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1496000'>Next stronger force? Electromagnetic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1501000'>I will just abbreviate it EM. Next stronger force?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1505000'>Weak force. And the next?</span> </p><p><span m='1506000'>Strong. Weak
  and strong are</span> <span m='1508000'>intranuclear forces. They are operable between
  the</span> <span m='1512000'>protons, the neutrons and the other elementary particles
  that</span> <span m='1517000'>make up the nucleus. It does not have a lot of</span>
  <span m='1520000'>effect, the weak and the strong force, on chemistry,</span> <span
  m='1524000'>except for beta emission for the radioactive elements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1530000'>Gravity actually does have no known chemical significance to</span>
  <span m='1536000'>chemistry. And so all of chemistry is tied</span> <span m='1540000'>up
  here in the electromagnetic force, which I am,</span> <span m='1545000'>at the moment,
  going to simplify and just call</span> <span m='1550000'>the Coulomb force. Now,
  we know how to describe</span> <span m='1555000'>the Coulomb force between charged
  particles.</span> </p><p><span m='1561000'>We know what expression to write down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1563000'>Let's do that. If we have the nucleus,</span> <span m='1566000'>which
  is positively charged, and the electron here,</span> <span m='1569000'>which is
  negatively charged, and they are at some distance r</span> <span m='1573000'>between
  each other, the expression that describes</span> <span m='1576000'>how that force
  of interaction changes with distance,</span> <span m='1580000'>this Coulomb's force
  law, it is just the magnitude of the</span> <span m='1584000'>charge of the electron
  times the magnitude of the charge on the</span> <span m='1588000'>nucleus over 4
  pi epsilon nought times r squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1596000'>I am going to
  just treat the force as a scalar,</span> <span m='1600000'>just for simplicity purposes
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1603000'>Epsilon nought is the permittivity of vacuum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1607000'>It is a factor in there for unit conversation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1611000'>r, then, is the distance between the electron and the</span> <span m='1616000'>nucleus.
  What does this say?</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>Well, this says that when r
  goes to infinity,</span> <span m='1623000'>what is the force? Zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1626000'>The particles are infinitely far apart.</span> </p><p><span m='1629000'>There
  is no force between them. In this case,</span> <span m='1633000'>an attractive force
  between them.</span> </p><p><span m='1636000'>When r is equal to zero, what is the
  force?</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>Infinite. And anywhere in between,</span>
  <span m='1643000'>that force is described by this one over r squared</span> <span
  m='1648000'>dependence. You can see that as the</span> <span m='1653000'>particles
  come closer and closer together, the force between them</span> <span m='1659000'>gets
  larger and larger. The closer they get,</span> <span m='1662000'>the larger the
  force, the more they want to be</span> <span m='1667000'>together. This expression
  is just telling</span> <span m='1670000'>me, if I held one particle and the other
  particle in my hand,</span> <span m='1676000'>and I held them at some distance from
  each other --</span> <span m='1682000'>That expression is just telling me the force
  with which I have</span> <span m='1686000'>to kind of exert to keep them apart.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1689000'>But now, if I let them go, you know what is going to</span>
  <span m='1694000'>happen. They are going to come</span> <span m='1696000'>together.
  They are going to want to come</span> <span m='1699000'>together because of that
  force. And what is not in this</span> <span m='1703000'>expression? What is not
  in that expression</span> <span m='1707000'>is any information about how those particles
  move under</span> <span m='1711000'>influence of that force. Nowhere in this expression
  is</span> <span m='1717000'>there an r of t, how that distance changes with</span>
  <span m='1722000'>time. And so what we need to describe</span> <span m='1725000'>that
  is a force law. And in 1911,</span> <span m='1728000'>the force law that seemed
  to describe the motion of all</span> <span m='1732000'>bodies, including astronomical
  ones, of course,</span> <span m='1736000'>the equation of motion that described
  how bodies move are</span> <span m='1741000'>Newton's equations of motion. And,
  in particular,</span> <span m='1746000'>F equals ma. And, of course,</span> <span
  m='1749000'>I can write that acceleration as a time derivative of the</span> <span
  m='1753000'>velocity, dv over dt.</span> </p><p><span m='1756000'>And that velocity,
  of course, itself is a change</span> <span m='1759000'>in the position with respect
  to time.</span> </p><p><span m='1762000'>This is m, the second derivative of r with
  respect to</span> <span m='1766000'>time.</span> </p><p><span m='1770000'>If I know
  the force that is operation, which is this,</span> <span m='1774000'>I can take
  this and plug it in here, and I am going to have a</span> <span m='1779000'>differential
  equation. And that differential equation</span> <span m='1784000'>is going to allow
  me to solve for what r is as a function of</span> <span m='1789000'>time, the distance
  between the two particles.</span> </p><p><span m='1793000'>And it is going to allow
  me to solve for that distance in a way</span> <span m='1798000'>that we call deterministic,
  exactly.</span> </p><p><span m='1803000'>In other words, if I know where the particles</span>
  <span m='1806000'>are to start with, using this equation of motion,</span> <span
  m='1811000'>this force law, I can tell you where those</span> <span m='1814000'>particles
  are going to be for all future time exactly.</span> </p><p><span m='1819000'>It
  is deterministic, the classical mechanical</span> <span m='1823000'>approach. Now,
  in order to solve this</span> <span m='1826000'>differential equation, I am going
  to have to develop a</span> <span m='1831000'>model for the atom. All differential
  equations,</span> <span m='1836000'>for the most part, describing physical processes</span>
  <span m='1840000'>are going to need a model. They are going to need some</span>
  <span m='1844000'>boundary conditions or initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1848000'>And the model, of course, that came to mind</span> <span m='1852000'>for
  the atom, is one in which the nucleus is</span> <span m='1855000'>in the center.
  And the electron moves around</span> <span m='1860000'>that nucleus with uniform
  circular motion and with a fixed</span> <span m='1866000'>radius. We are going to
  call that fixed</span> <span m='1869000'>radius r star. It is a planetary model.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1874000'>That seems like a good guess for the structure of the atom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1879000'>Now, if you have a particle undergoing uniform circular</span>
  <span m='1885000'>motion at some well-defined radius here.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>That
  particle is being constantly accelerated.</span> </p><p><span m='1894000'>And I
  can write that acceleration a as the linear</span> <span m='1900000'>velocity squared
  over that radius of its orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='1905000'>It is being accelerated
  because the velocity</span> <span m='1911000'>vector. The direction is changing,</span>
  <span m='1915000'>so there is a constant acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>Now,
  this expression, for many of you,</span> <span m='1922000'>I pulled out of the air.
  Some of you have seen it</span> <span m='1926000'>before. It is an 8.01 topic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1928000'>You are going to see it this semester, but later on and
  in</span> <span m='1935000'>this right now here, but you will recall later on</span>
  <span m='1939000'>this semester that you have seen it here in 5.112.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1943000'>But, if this is the acceleration,</span> <span m='1946000'>I can take
  this expression for the acceleration and plug it</span> <span m='1950000'>into here.
  Plug in my operating force law.</span> </p><p><span m='1956000'>And, in so doing,
  I am going to get --</span> <span m='1970000'>-- e squared over 4 pi epsilon nought
  r star squared.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>That is the F. Mass times the acceleration,</span>
  <span m='1984000'>m times v squared over r star. That is my equation of motion</span>
  <span m='1989000'>particular to this problem of a planetary model.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1994000'>And now I can solve that for v squared, the linear velocity of</span>
  <span m='2000000'>that electron going around the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='2003000'>That
  comes out to be e squared over 4 pi epsilon nought m r</span> <span m='2009000'>star.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2014000'>Now, the reason I wanted to calculate the velocity squared</span>
  <span m='2019000'>here is because I want to calculate kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2024000'>And that is easy to do. Kinetic energy,</span> <span m='2027000'>I will
  call K, is one-half m times v squared.</span> </p><p><span m='2031000'>If I plug
  in the v squared right in there,</span> <span m='2037000'>I get one-half e squared
  over 4 pi epsilon nought r star.</span> </p><p><span m='2043000'>So far, everything
  looks okay.</span> </p><p><span m='2050000'>We have a planetary model. Coulomb's
  law is operable.</span> </p><p><span m='2055000'>We know the acceleration. We just
  calculated the kinetic</span> <span m='2061000'>energy of this electron going around
  the nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>What I want to do now is I want to
  know the total energy of the</span> <span m='2073000'>system. I just calculated
  the kinetic</span> <span m='2077000'>energy of the system, but I want to know the
  total</span> <span m='2082000'>energy of the system. And the total energy of the</span>
  <span m='2087000'>system, I am going to call this capital E, total energy,</span>
  <span m='2092000'>is the kinetic energy plus the potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2098000'>And I want the total energy of the system for two reasons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2102000'>One is I want to show you that the system is bound,</span> <span m='2106000'>that
  the total energy is going to be negative,</span> <span m='2110000'>that it is lower
  than the total energy when the electron and the</span> <span m='2115000'>nucleus
  are separated. I want to show you that within</span> <span m='2119000'>this classical
  model, the electron and the nucleus do</span> <span m='2123000'>look bound. To do
  that, I need to show you</span> <span m='2126000'>the total energy is negative.
  To do that, I need to calculate</span> <span m='2132000'>the potential energy. That
  is what I want to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2136000'>Secondly, I want to get an
  expression for the total energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2141000'>Because, using
  that expression, I am going to show you how this</span> <span m='2147000'>classical
  mechanics fails. How Newton's equations of</span> <span m='2151000'>motion won't
  work to describe this problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2155000'>Now, I have run out
  of time. I will do that on Monday,</span> <span m='2161000'>but that is where we
  are going. All right.</span> </p><p><span m='2164892'>See you on Monday.</span>
