  is available at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='15000'>Today is a very big day
  for all of you.</span> </p><p><span m='19000'>Your first semester at MIT is half
  over.</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>And, in addition to that, you have a lot of
  challenges</span> <span m='35000'>remaining ahead of you for the rest of this semester.</span>
  </p><p><span m='41000'>I am going to help make the chemical challenges fun for you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47000'>That is what I am here to do. I love chemistry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52000'>I love teaching 5.112. This is the best part of my</span> <span m='57000'>week.
  So, here we are.</span> </p><p><span m='61000'>Do you guys know that chemistry can
  be incredibly fun?</span> </p><p><span m='75000'>Let me just show you how fun chemistry
  can be.</span> </p><p><span m='86000'>And that is just the gravy. The fun part is
  actually making</span> <span m='89000'>the molecules. Any of you see this picture
  in</span> <span m='94000'>U.S.A. Today recently?</span> </p><p><span m='102000'>Not
  reading that important journal, I see.</span> </p><p><span m='104000'>Well, this
  picture did appear very recently in U.S.A.</span> </p><p><span m='108000'>Today
  in a story that talked about the recent Nobel Prize in</span> <span m='112000'>chemistry
  that was awarded to Professor Richard R.</span> </p><p><span m='116000'>Schrock,
  of our department. And, in fact,</span> <span m='119000'>I don't know if you realize
  this, but Professor Schrock was</span> <span m='123000'>the first person ever awarded
  the Nobel Prize in Chemistry at</span> <span m='127000'>MIT for work conducted while
  at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='130000'>That is a pretty amazing accomplishment because
  we have</span> <span m='133000'>so many tremendous chemists on the faculty here,</span>
  <span m='137000'>and he is the first one to break through in that manner.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140000'>And maybe you are here at a very special time,</span> <span
  m='143000'>and we will see a number more of these in the next few years.</span>
  </p><p><span m='149000'>May with you contributing, so much the better because you</span>
  <span m='153000'>are here. And let me just explain</span> <span m='155000'>something,
  too. Chemistry is fun.</span> </p><p><span m='157000'>And only on very rare occasions
  like this would Professor</span> <span m='161000'>Schrock be drinking champagne
  at 8:30 in the morning,</span> <span m='165000'>when this picture was taken. The
  Reuters reporter,</span> <span m='169000'>Brian, who took this photo, is actually
  a pretty good</span> <span m='173000'>friend of Professor Nocera here. And so he
  rode over from the</span> <span m='177000'>Schrock household. And Dick and Dan came
  in</span> <span m='181000'>together in the same car, as they often do,</span> <span
  m='184000'>from Winchester on that morning, which was a very</span> <span m='187000'>exciting
  day. If you come to see me for</span> <span m='190000'>office hours maybe I will
  tell you more about it in detail,</span> <span m='194000'>but it was an exciting
  day. And I am in here,</span> <span m='197000'>too. My name is Kit Cummins.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199000'>Kit is my nickname. My name is Christopher.</span> </p><p><span
  m='201000'>You can call me Christopher or Kit, or you can call me</span> <span m='205000'>Professor
  Cummins, or you can just say hey,</span> <span m='208000'>chemistry guy. That will
  be fine.</span> </p><p><span m='212000'>I am in this picture primarily because it
  is part of being in</span> <span m='216000'>the right place at the right time, just
  like I am here now in</span> <span m='220000'>front of you. But also I am in it
  because we</span> <span m='223000'>three are three in one of the areas in our department
  that</span> <span m='227000'>really focus our research on inorganic chemistry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='231000'>And what is inorganic chemistry?</span> </p><p><span m='233000'>I
  will say more about this during the semester.</span> </p><p><span m='238000'>But
  inorganic chemistry is really the chemistry of the</span> <span m='242000'>elements
  of the Periodic Table inclusively.</span> </p><p><span m='245000'>So, a pretty broad
  topic. And I like doing chemistry with</span> <span m='249000'>lots of elements.
  And so that is why these guys</span> <span m='252000'>and I share an association
  with each other.</span> </p><p><span m='256000'>And, in fact, I was a graduate student
  with</span> <span m='259000'>Professor Schrock. And I am very,</span> <span m='261000'>very
  proud to be able to say that.</span> </p><p><span m='264000'>Hopefully, my computer
  will be staying on, here.</span> </p><p><span m='269000'>And I want to point out,
  too, that people who love</span> <span m='272000'>science want to know something
  about its history.</span> </p><p><span m='276000'>And part of all of that is knowing
  the academic family from</span> <span m='280000'>which you derive, depending on
  the person you've</span> <span m='283000'>studied with in learning about chemistry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='286000'>And I studied with Schrock. And Schrock studied with</span>
  <span m='290000'>Osborn, a fantastic chemist in his own right,</span> <span m='293000'>no
  longer alive, sadly, to see his progeny,</span> <span m='296000'>Professor Schrock,
  win the Nobel Prize.</span> </p><p><span m='301000'>And Osborn studied with Wilkinson,
  and Wilkinson was</span> <span m='304000'>also a Nobel Prize winner. So, you do
  not have to go very</span> <span m='308000'>far back in that lineage to encounter
  that recognition,</span> <span m='311000'>the Nobel Prize, Schrock, and then it
  skipped</span> <span m='314000'>Osborne, and if you go back to Wilkinson, there
  is another one.</span> </p><p><span m='318000'>And you can keep going back. And
  I am not going to go</span> <span m='322000'>through that whole history today because
  I have another history</span> <span m='326000'>that I am going to need to go through
  with you today.</span> </p><p><span m='331000'>And I am going to bring this back
  over so it does not</span> <span m='340000'>distract you. And this other history
  that I</span> <span m='348000'>need to impart to you today has to do with some of
  the</span> <span m='357000'>contributions of Gilbert Newton Lewis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='366000'>This is one of the most famous of all chemists ever.</span> </p><p><span
  m='369000'>And if you like chemistry, I encourage you to think of the</span> <span
  m='374000'>word Newton, as it is found engraved in one of the pillars</span> <span
  m='378000'>in Killian Court at MIT as the middle name of Gilbert Newton</span> <span
  m='383000'>Lewis. It is conceivable that having</span> <span m='386000'>that middle
  name weighed heavily upon Gilbert during his</span> <span m='390000'>lifetime. But
  it remains a good moniker.</span> </p><p><span m='394000'>And in the future, when
  you have kids,</span> <span m='397000'>I encourage you to consider using it as a
  middle name.</span> </p><p><span m='401000'>It worked well in this particular case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='403000'>When you get the notes for today, which incidentally will</span>
  <span m='408000'>be available on the website after class today,</span> <span m='411000'>so
  you don't need to write down everything I am writing down.</span> </p><p><span m='416000'>You
  are actually going to get a little bit more in the online</span> <span m='420000'>version
  than what I am writing down here.</span> </p><p><span m='425000'>And if you find
  that you forgot something that I said during</span> <span m='428000'>class, just
  email me. I will tell you what I said.</span> </p><p><span m='431000'>It is not
  a problem. But if you want to write down</span> <span m='434000'>notes while I am
  speaking just to make notes that you can refer</span> <span m='437000'>to later
  to refresh your memory, that is fine.</span> </p><p><span m='440000'>I think your
  taking in information in lots of different</span> <span m='443000'>ways. We are
  going to use the</span> <span m='445000'>computer and we are going to use the blackboard
  today.</span> </p><p><span m='449000'>And you are going to have available stuff
  from the</span> <span m='452000'>Internet a little bit later, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='454000'>And all of that is good. I think you should try to</span> <span m='457000'>reinforce
  and not worry if some of the information is a little</span> <span m='462000'>redundant.
  And never be afraid to ask</span> <span m='464000'>questions, especially, I like
  to take questions by</span> <span m='468000'>email or if you come knock on my office
  door.</span> </p><p><span m='472000'>In 1916, Gilbert Lewis published a landmark
  paper in</span> <span m='478000'>chemistry in the journal of the American Chemical
  Society which</span> <span m='486000'>remains the flagship journal of the American
  Chemical Society.</span> </p><p><span m='494000'>And this paper was entitled "The
  Atom and the Molecule."</span> <span m='517000'>Besides being an incredibly important
  and influential paper</span> <span m='521000'>in the history of chemistry, "The
  Atom and the Molecule" was</span> <span m='525000'>also the basis for --</span>
  <span m='548000'>Like I said, besides being a hugely</span> <span m='550000'>influential
  manuscript, "The Atom and the Molecule"</span> <span m='553000'>also laid the foundations
  for Lewis's thinking about</span> <span m='557000'>electronic structure theory that
  shaped the way we still today</span> <span m='561000'>talk about valence and chemical
  bonding.</span> </p><p><span m='564000'>So, an incredibly important paper from 1916.</span>
  </p><p><span m='568000'>In the lecture notes today, you will find the specific</span>
  <span m='571000'>volume and page number for that reference in the journal of the</span>
  <span m='575000'>American Chemical Society. And I encourage you in your</span> <span
  m='579000'>copious free time to download that paper.</span> </p><p><span m='582000'>It
  is really great. All the American Chemical</span> <span m='585000'>Society journal
  articles are available, from the very</span> <span m='588000'>beginning. And you
  can download it and</span> <span m='591000'>read it. And, having had this</span>
  <span m='592000'>introduction today, I think it will probably prove</span> <span
  m='596000'>to be a very fascinating exercise for you,</span> <span m='599000'>if
  you choose to do so. It also was the basis of a book</span> <span m='604000'>that
  Gilbert Newton Lewis later wrote on valance and on atoms</span> <span m='609000'>and
  molecules. That is also a classic in</span> <span m='613000'>chemistry. And, should
  you be shopping for</span> <span m='616000'>chemistry books on e-bay or something,
  you might find a rare</span> <span m='621000'>copy of it. And if you do and choose
  not to</span> <span m='625000'>buy it, please alert me and I will buy it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='630000'>But Gilbert Newton Lewis, "The Atom and the Molecule."</span>
  <span m='636000'>In this paper you are going to see, if you do choose to</span>
  <span m='643000'>download it, that he was thinking about polarity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='649000'>And he was also thinking about the relationship between the</span> <span
  m='656000'>polarity of a molecule relates to the polarity of a substance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='665000'>And I mean, when I say a polarity of a substance,</span>
  <span m='669000'>that that would be a sample, you could say a water molecule</span>
  <span m='674000'>down here and liquid water up here.</span> </p><p><span m='683000'>And
  you will see this kind of sigmoidal graph that Lewis made</span> <span m='688000'>in
  thinking about how polar condensed phase substances were</span> <span m='693000'>as
  compared with the structure of the molecules that comprise</span> <span m='698000'>the
  substance. Down here, in this region,</span> <span m='702000'>you will find that
  there are substances that are not terribly</span> <span m='707000'>polar. And what
  I have written here is</span> <span m='710000'>the organic shorthand for the hexane
  molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='714000'>Liquid hexane is an alkane, akin to methane,</span>
  <span m='718000'>which is natural gas. And so, if you are not familiar</span> <span
  m='723000'>with this way of writing organic molecules, I will just tell you</span>
  <span m='727000'>briefly that this terminus is CH three or a methyl group,</span>
  <span m='731000'>and then it is CH two, CH two, CH two,</span> <span m='733000'>CH
  two, and then CH three, another methyl group.</span> </p><p><span m='736000'>So,
  that is some organic shorthand.</span> </p><p><span m='740000'>And I will go through
  that kind of shorthand occasionally so</span> <span m='743000'>that you become familiar
  with it.</span> </p><p><span m='745000'>And that is the hexane molecule, a very
  non-polar</span> <span m='748000'>molecule composed of elements, carbon and hydrogen,</span>
  <span m='751000'>that have very similar electronegativity.</span> </p><p><span m='755000'>And
  then he goes on up the curve here, and you find this</span> <span m='760000'>familiar
  molecule, benzene, considered next,</span> <span m='764000'>as being somehow more
  polar than hexane, and liquid benzene</span> <span m='769000'>accordingly in its
  solvating properties in the condensed</span> <span m='774000'>phase, being a more
  polar medium, as it were.</span> </p><p><span m='780000'>And then, as we continue
  progress up this scale,</span> <span m='784000'>he writes next molecules like the
  diethyl ether molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='789000'>No doubt you are familiar
  with ether and its applications as an</span> <span m='794000'>anesthetic. The first
  use of ether as an</span> <span m='798000'>anesthesia in an operation in medicine
  was carried out just</span> <span m='803000'>across the river in Boston. There is
  this historical Ether</span> <span m='808000'>Dome there that you can go and look
  at.</span> </p><p><span m='813000'>But, nonetheless, we are just getting up a little</span>
  <span m='817000'>bit more polar than benzene. And then next you find</span> <span
  m='821000'>molecules like this one. That contains an organic</span> <span m='825000'>functional
  group called an ester.</span> </p><p><span m='828000'>That is ethyl acetate, which
  is a substance that you</span> <span m='832000'>might have smelled if you ever built
  models,</span> <span m='836000'>because some of the glues that you may have used
  would contain</span> <span m='841000'>it, or the paints. And so, it is a system
  that,</span> <span m='846000'>in terms of its molecular structure, is more polar.</span>
  </p><p><span m='851000'>And, when you use it in the condensed phase,</span> <span
  m='855000'>it behaves in a manner that you would describe as more polar.</span>
  </p><p><span m='861000'>And then, finally, you get up to some very polar</span>
  <span m='865000'>systems, like the water molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='870000'>Like
  the ammonia molecule. And, finally,</span> <span m='873000'>Lewis talks about a
  species like this, which is sodium twice</span> <span m='878000'>sulfur. That is
  actually called sodium</span> <span m='883000'>sulfide. And it is a salt analogous
  to</span> <span m='886000'>table salt, sodium chloride.</span> </p><p><span m='889000'>And
  being a salt, it is obviously very polar</span> <span m='893000'>because there is
  quite a large degree of charge separation</span> <span m='898000'>between the atoms
  in the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='903000'>And, accordingly, if you take that
  salt and heat</span> <span m='905000'>it up until you have got it as hot as its
  melting point and</span> <span m='909000'>make it liquid, that molten salt has</span>
  <span m='911000'>individually charged ions moving around in solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='914000'>And that provides a very polar medium, which would be excellent</span>
  <span m='918000'>at dissolving polar things. You will notice here that on</span>
  <span m='922000'>the non-polar side we have elements, carbon and hydrogen,</span>
  <span m='925000'>that are very close to each other in electronegativity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='930000'>And then, as we examine this relationship,</span> <span
  m='933000'>we start putting in elements like oxygen or nitrogen,</span> <span m='937000'>which
  are very electronegative close to the upper right-hand</span> <span m='941000'>side
  of the Periodic Table. That introduces polarity both</span> <span m='945000'>in
  the molecule and in substances comprised of the</span> <span m='949000'>molecule.
  And then all the way over to</span> <span m='952000'>the involved atoms, sodium
  and sulfur are very</span> <span m='955000'>different in electronegativity and,
  therefore,</span> <span m='958000'>have very strongly separated charges.</span>
  </p><p><span m='963000'>And, in thinking about this, Lewis proposed the notion of
  a</span> <span m='968000'>continuum. And his musing on this are</span> <span m='972000'>really
  quite lucid in that paper, but the idea was that a</span> <span m='978000'>molecule,
  or a part of a molecule even,</span> <span m='982000'>you can analyze molecules
  in terms of smaller pieces of them</span> <span m='988000'>that can be identified
  within the larger molecule,</span> <span m='993000'>can lie on either side of a
  continuum in reference to a</span> <span m='998000'>number of different properties.
  And the section of class that</span> <span m='1006000'>we are launching into today
  deals with acid-base properties.</span> </p><p><span m='1013000'>Let's mention that
  first, acid and base.</span> </p><p><span m='1017000'>These are two ends of a continuum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1022000'>But he also recognized that you could have a molecule that
  would</span> <span m='1029000'>be an oxidant. And the counterpart to that is</span>
  <span m='1035000'>a reductant. And then, here is a term that</span> <span m='1040000'>maybe
  those of you who have studied organic chemistry in</span> <span m='1047000'>more
  detail than most would recognize.</span> </p><p><span m='1053000'>This is electrophile.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1064000'>Electrophile has a counterpart called a nucleophile.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1080000'>And then, the fourth one that I would like to mention is</span>
  <span m='1086000'>acceptor.</span> </p><p><span m='1093000'>And, of course, the
  counterpart to that is</span> <span m='1095000'>donor.</span> </p><p><span m='1101000'>Please
  remember those four pairs because when you can</span> <span m='1105000'>understand
  and make predictions about those four properties as a</span> <span m='1111000'>function
  of molecular structure, then you will be a chemist.</span> </p><p><span m='1118000'>I
  mean that is a large part of what it is all about,</span> <span m='1121000'>understanding
  all the different chemical properties that will</span> <span m='1126000'>make it
  interested in terms of acid-base, oxidant-reductant,</span> <span m='1130000'>electrophile-nucleophile,
  and acceptor and donor.</span> </p><p><span m='1135000'>And the currency of chemistry
  can be seen, with reference to</span> <span m='1140000'>this, to be the electron.
  That is what chemistry is all</span> <span m='1145000'>about. And so, we will be
  talking a</span> <span m='1148000'>lot about atoms and molecules with reference
  to their</span> <span m='1153000'>properties and how the properties stem from knowing</span>
  <span m='1157000'>something about the electrons in the molecule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1161000'>And I think you are going to find this to be quite fun.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1175000'>With respect to the properties of the medium,</span> <span m='1178000'>let's
  talk about a substance like hydrogen chloride.</span> </p><p><span m='1188000'>This
  is just to illustrate what I was saying over there.</span> </p><p><span m='1193000'>If
  you take a molecule like hydrogen chloride,</span> <span m='1197000'>and it is a
  gas, of course.</span> </p><p><span m='1200000'>And if you make a solution of it
  in hexane,</span> <span m='1204000'>hexane is going to be our solvent, and then
  what you find</span> <span m='1210000'>is that in this low polarity medium hexane
  solution,</span> <span m='1216000'>liquid hexane, the HCl molecule remains intact</span>
  <span m='1221000'>and floats around in solution, interacting weakly with hexane</span>
  <span m='1227000'>molecules that surround it. But if you take this HCl</span> <span
  m='1234000'>molecule and put it into a solvent like water,</span> <span m='1240000'>then
  something on the other end of the continuum transpires</span> <span m='1247000'>because
  we get ionization to produce hydrogen ions.</span> </p><p><span m='1253000'>And
  they go off and are separated in solution from</span> <span m='1259000'>chloride
  ions. And we will talk more about</span> <span m='1264000'>just what is going on
  when you separate H plus from Cl</span> <span m='1269000'>minus and let them diffuse
  apart in aqueous</span> <span m='1273000'>solution. But you can see,</span> <span
  m='1275000'>I think, the dichotomy. Either the proton shares in the</span> <span
  m='1279000'>electrons of the chloride, or it just pops off and ionizes</span> <span
  m='1284000'>and goes out into solution. And Lewis wanted to understand</span> <span
  m='1288000'>this. And, to understand it,</span> <span m='1292000'>he developed a
  theory. And his theory was the "cube</span> <span m='1297000'>theory." In this part
  we get to draw some cubes.</span> </p><p><span m='1302000'>And he decided that if
  you thought of the nucleus,</span> <span m='1307000'>which he calls the kernel,
  of an atom as being located at</span> <span m='1313000'>the center of the system,
  then if you had an atom like</span> <span m='1319000'>neon, which is a noble gas
  with eight valance electrons,</span> <span m='1325000'>that these valance electrons
  would want to get away from each</span> <span m='1331000'>other as far as possible
  because they repel each other.</span> </p><p><span m='1339000'>They are all negatively
  charged.</span> </p><p><span m='1341000'>This could be, here, the neon atom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1344000'>Here, on that cube, is how he would represent the</span>
  <span m='1348000'>electronic structure of the neon atom, with the eight electrons</span>
  <span m='1353000'>here represented by peach-colored circles,</span> <span m='1357000'>each
  the vertex of a cube. So, they got far away from each</span> <span m='1362000'>other.
  And you can see that in the</span> <span m='1364000'>historical archives, some of
  his original sketch</span> <span m='1368000'>books containing these ideas are there,
  and now you will know</span> <span m='1372000'>what they mean. You will see that
  he progressed</span> <span m='1375000'>beyond understanding the atom to understanding
  the molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1381000'>And here is one of the molecules that
  he talks about.</span> </p><p><span m='1402000'>Here we have a molecule containing
  14 valance electrons,</span> <span m='1408000'>all arranged in that manner. And
  this could be,</span> <span m='1414000'>for example, the I two molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1419000'>And let me draw it in terms of a dot structure,</span>
  <span m='1425000'>--</span> <span m='1432000'>-- like that. And there was known
  at the</span> <span m='1435000'>time, partly because of the contributions of Lewis
  himself,</span> <span m='1441000'>something called the Rule of Eight.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1445000'>And that was a reference to this notion that most atoms want</span>
  <span m='1450000'>to have eight electrons in their valance shell,</span> <span m='1454000'>and
  it is also something that we call today the Octet Rule.</span> </p><p><span m='1460000'>So,
  when you see the Rule of Eight mentioned in his paper,</span> <span m='1465000'>it
  is the familiar Octet Rule. And you can see here that one</span> <span m='1471000'>of
  the key features is two electrons shared equally.</span> </p><p><span m='1477000'>And
  when electrons are shared equally like that,</span> <span m='1480000'>you have a
  molecule with symmetrical charge distribution,</span> <span m='1485000'>charge referring
  to the electrons where they are in</span> <span m='1488000'>space. And then, he
  showed that you</span> <span m='1491000'>could think about this another way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1505000'>You could consider some kind of a geometric distortion
  of the I</span> <span m='1510000'>two molecule, like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1512000'>Distorted,
  not only because of my drawing, but because of the</span> <span m='1517000'>way
  the atoms themselves are thought to be rearranging in</span> <span m='1522000'>this
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='1534000'>Notice that what has happened here is that
  the I two</span> <span m='1539000'>molecule is doing something electronically such
  that one</span> <span m='1544000'>iodine is starting to pull away from the other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1549000'>This one over here is carrying with it the electron that
  came</span> <span m='1555000'>from over here. And, in that case,</span> <span m='1558000'>what
  we have is a molecule in which we are developing partial</span> <span m='1564000'>negative
  charge on the right-hand side and partial</span> <span m='1568000'>positive charge
  on the left-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m='1574000'>As I was talking up here,
  I was thinking about what I was</span> <span m='1578000'>going to say here, because
  the ideal is that</span> <span m='1581000'>molecules, even if they are inherently
  non-polar like the I</span> <span m='1585000'>two molecule, in their equilibrium
  structure</span> <span m='1589000'>they can have electron fluctuations that lead
  to</span> <span m='1593000'>partial charges in the manner shown here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1597000'>And Lewis was working beautifully toward the</span> <span m='1599000'>development
  of a theory like this that would allow the</span> <span m='1602000'>description
  of electronic structure to be made graphically</span> <span m='1605000'>apparent.
  And this is something that</span> <span m='1608000'>chemists really like to do,
  is we like to be able to see</span> <span m='1611000'>stuff. I hope I am going to
  be able to</span> <span m='1613000'>show you some really cool stuff this semester.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1616000'>And, in fact, even some really cool stuff</span> <span
  m='1618000'>before we finish here today. So, that is the development of</span> <span
  m='1623000'>charge as represented using the Lewis cube theory in an I two</span>
  <span m='1628000'>molecule. Next, one thing you could do is</span> <span m='1632000'>say,
  let's just continue this process, and the right-hand</span> <span m='1637000'>iodine
  with its eight electrons pops off.</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>That would give
  you an ionized situation in which you had an I</span> <span m='1645000'>minus floating
  away from an I plus molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1652000'>And that situation
  is drawn in the notes, and because I am</span> <span m='1655000'>running out of
  space on this board I am not going to draw</span> <span m='1659000'>that one up.
  Instead I am going to go onto</span> <span m='1662000'>another triumph of the Lewis
  cube theory, which was its</span> <span m='1666000'>ability to explain different
  chemical bond orders.</span> </p><p><span m='1682000'>By the way, Lewis never got
  the Nobel Prize.</span> </p><p><span m='1685000'>He certainly should have. A dramatic
  oversight.</span> </p><p><span m='1688000'>He was born in Massachusetts. He was
  a Harvard professor for</span> <span m='1693000'>a while and did not like it, and
  came to MIT to be a</span> <span m='1696000'>professor for a while. And, although
  he liked that,</span> <span m='1700000'>that was not far enough away from Harvard,</span>
  <span m='1703000'>so he went to Berkeley, where he became the department</span>
  <span m='1707000'>head and was very successful over a long period of time in</span>
  <span m='1711000'>learning about chemistry and in teaching chemistry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1717000'>I will invite you, and you will see this in the</span> <span m='1720000'>notes,
  too, to go ahead and see if you can find a good biography</span> <span m='1725000'>of
  Lewis because it is very instructive.</span> </p><p><span m='1729000'>Anyway, here
  is another molecule considered by Lewis's</span> <span m='1733000'>cube theory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1740000'>How many electrons are being shared by the two nuclei or</span>
  <span m='1745000'>atoms involved? Four electrons shared.</span> </p><p><span m='1749000'>We
  can circle them here. That is four electrons shared.</span> </p><p><span m='1755000'>Therefore,
  that is not a single bond.</span> </p><p><span m='1758000'>We call that a double
  bond. And so, that might be a</span> <span m='1763000'>representation of, for example,</span>
  <span m='1767000'>the O two molecule. Here we have I two,</span> <span m='1772000'>here
  we have distorted I two with charges developing,</span> <span m='1777000'>and here
  we have O two. O two is a very</span> <span m='1781000'>interesting diatomic molecule.
  We are going to talk about that</span> <span m='1785000'>later in the semester,
  but for now let's just leave it</span> <span m='1789000'>at that. But then, even
  though this was</span> <span m='1793000'>quite a successful theory, the cube theory,</span>
  <span m='1797000'>it has certain problems, certain shortcomings,</span> <span m='1800000'>such
  as, we can do single bonds with it quite well,</span> <span m='1804000'>and now
  we can do double bonds with the cube theory,</span> <span m='1809000'>but what do
  you do if you have to make a triple bond?</span> </p><p><span m='1813000'>That was
  a problem for Lewis. That should be a problem for</span> <span m='1818000'>you,
  too. Cubes just don't fit together</span> <span m='1821000'>that way. They have
  edges and faces,</span> <span m='1824000'>and that is it. And they have vertices.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1829000'>You can do one vertex. So, triple bond is a problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1833000'>And we know that there are molecules that have triple</span>
  <span m='1837000'>bonds. And we cannot handle them with</span> <span m='1839000'>the
  cube theory, so we are going to have to</span> <span m='1843000'>something a little
  different, for that reason.</span> </p><p><span m='1846000'>But there is also another
  reason that had to do with just</span> <span m='1851000'>considering the chemistry
  of light elements like hydrogen and</span> <span m='1855000'>helium. Those elements
  tend to</span> <span m='1858000'>associate themselves with only two electrons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1863000'>And so, Lewis decided, well, maybe the rule of two is</span>
  <span m='1868000'>more fundamental than the rule of eight, and that we should be</span>
  <span m='1874000'>thinking about pairs of electrons somehow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1878000'>Because he looked at what was known about chemistry and</span> <span
  m='1884000'>realized that in most molecules, the number of electrons is</span> <span
  m='1889000'>always even, is always divisible by two.</span> </p><p><span m='1895000'>That
  is something interesting about two electrons at a time</span> <span m='1899000'>being
  important. You take that together with the</span> <span m='1903000'>triple bond
  problem, and Lewis started thinking in</span> <span m='1907000'>terms of electron
  pairs, and this is where this</span> <span m='1911000'>"electron pair theory" comes
  from.</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>Although he spent a lot of time on the cube
  theory,</span> <span m='1924000'>he was perfectly willing to cast that theory aside
  in favor</span> <span m='1929000'>of something that maybe was going to work a little
  better,</span> <span m='1934000'>the electron pair theory. And how does that look?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1938000'>Well, of course, his initial pictures still had</span>
  <span m='1943000'>the cube, which just shows that once the human mind fixes on</span>
  <span m='1948000'>something, it fixes on it with great tenacity and it can be</span>
  <span m='1953000'>hard to shake your way of thinking about things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1959000'>But hopefully you will be able to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1962000'>He
  still decided, let's arrange these electron</span> <span m='1965000'>pairs on a
  cube with the nucleus of the atom supposed to be at</span> <span m='1970000'>the
  center, and let's keep these electrons, now,</span> <span m='1974000'>nicely collected
  in pairs. And let's get these pairs as</span> <span m='1978000'>far away from each
  other as possible, for the same reasons</span> <span m='1983000'>we used to be putting
  eight electrons as far away from each</span> <span m='1988000'>other as possible,
  namely, electron repulsion.</span> </p><p><span m='1993000'>Now, the problem of
  electron repulsion between the pairs was</span> <span m='1997000'>not really solved.
  And Lewis decided that the pair</span> <span m='2000000'>theory worked so well that
  he was not going to worry about</span> <span m='2005000'>that, and so we won't worry
  about it yet,</span> <span m='2007000'>either. You have your four pairs of</span>
  <span m='2011000'>electrons arranged at the center of four of the edges of the</span>
  <span m='2017000'>cube, and that geometry is what we call a tetrahedron,</span>
  <span m='2023000'>which I am drawing the edges of here in pink.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2027000'>You have a tetrahedral disposition of four pairs of</span> <span m='2032000'>electrons,
  now, for an atom.</span> </p><p><span m='2035000'>This might again be the neon atom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2040000'>But the nice thing about this choice is that if you want
  to</span> <span m='2051000'>you can make single bonds with this theory, and you
  can make</span> <span m='2064000'>double bonds --</span> <span m='2073000'>-- with
  this theory, like that.</span> </p><p><span m='2079000'>And then, due to the properties
  of the tetrahedron,</span> <span m='2089000'>you can also make triple bonds. This
  is marvelous.</span> </p><p><span m='2100000'>You can see that the famous chemist
  Gilbert Newton Lewis was</span> <span m='2105000'>talking about electronic structure
  in terms of</span> <span m='2109000'>symmetrical things, like tetrahedra and cubes,</span>
  <span m='2112000'>as a way of arranging electrons reasonably in space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2117000'>This could, again, be our iodine molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2120000'>This
  could be, now, our O two molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2124000'>And, if we continue
  that progression in the Periodic</span> <span m='2129000'>Table, what is this molecule?
  Dinitrogen, N two,</span> <span m='2135000'>the major component of our atmosphere,
  another interesting</span> <span m='2141000'>molecule that we will be talking about
  as the semester progresses</span> <span m='2147000'>forward. But chemical language
  and</span> <span m='2151000'>electronic structure theory are very much still permeated
  with</span> <span m='2157000'>this affection for symmetry and the problems that
  you can solve</span> <span m='2163000'>using symmetry to analyze electronic structure
  theory.</span> </p><p><span m='2170000'>Let's talk next about another molecule because
  we want to talk</span> <span m='2175000'>about Lewis's development of the electron
  pair theory,</span> <span m='2180000'>but also we want to understand how that relates
  to acid-base</span> <span m='2186000'>properties. And so, let me draw here</span>
  <span m='2189000'>another molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2197000'>And when you
  look at this molecule, which is the aluminum</span> <span m='2201000'>trichloride
  molecule, in which I am drawing out</span> <span m='2205000'>explicitly all of the
  electrons, not forgetting these two.</span> </p><p><span m='2210000'>And having
  drawn the aluminum trichloride molecule</span> <span m='2214000'>and looked at it
  like that, you can ask yourself is the</span> <span m='2219000'>number of electrons
  divisible by eight?</span> </p><p><span m='2223000'>Yes it is. We have a 24 valance
  electron</span> <span m='2226000'>system here. It is divisible by eight.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2230000'>Of course, it is also divisible by two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2234000'>You can also ask yourself is this molecule,</span> <span m='2238000'>as
  written, one that satisfies the rule of eight for all four</span> <span m='2243000'>of
  the atoms? No.</span> </p><p><span m='2245000'>We have a problem there because this
  thing is electron</span> <span m='2250000'>deficient.</span> </p><p><span m='2262000'>And
  if you were Lewis, you would want to know,</span> <span m='2265000'>well, if it
  is electron deficient, this molecule must be</span> <span m='2270000'>doing something
  about that to get more electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2274000'>Which atom is
  missing electrons, here?</span> </p><p><span m='2278000'>The aluminum. How can we
  give aluminum more</span> <span m='2282000'>electrons, in a structure like this?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2284000'>Can we get it up to the rule of eight?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2293000'>Double bonds, awesome.</span> </p><p><span m='2294000'>Beautiful. We
  can make a double bond.</span> </p><p><span m='2298000'>And, if we do that, we can
  allow aluminum to</span> <span m='2302000'>satisfy the rule of eight, or allow the
  rule of eight to</span> <span m='2307000'>satisfy aluminum. Whichever way you want
  to look</span> <span m='2313000'>at it. And see what we have done,</span> <span
  m='2316000'>here? We have taken one of the</span> <span m='2319000'>electron pairs,
  say, this one,</span> <span m='2322000'>and we have moved it in between the aluminum
  and the chlorine,</span> <span m='2329000'>so it joins the other one in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2332000'>And we get a double bond. And now, everybody has an</span>
  <span m='2337000'>octet. But what is the problem with</span> <span m='2342000'>that?
  The problem with that is that</span> <span m='2345000'>chlorine is very electronegative,</span>
  <span m='2348000'>and it does not want its electrons stolen away by the</span> <span
  m='2353000'>very electropositive aluminum center.</span> </p><p><span m='2356000'>There
  are other ways that aluminum can ultimately satisfy</span> <span m='2361000'>its
  octet, and this is how we get into the realm of "Lewis</span> <span m='2367000'>acid-base
  theory." And I want to show you one of</span> <span m='2372000'>the other ways that
  aluminum can satisfy its octet,</span> <span m='2376000'>and then, we are going
  to move to the computer so we can</span> <span m='2381000'>visualize some of these
  properties.</span> </p><p><span m='2384000'>If I put my aluminum here -- and do
  you remember this</span> <span m='2389000'>molecule up here, the ammonia molecule?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2392000'>I am going to say that if I draw that ammonia molecule
  in</span> <span m='2397000'>place, here --</span> <span m='2405000'>The ammonia
  molecule comes in, and it has its eight electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='2410000'>It
  is sharing six of them with three hydrogens.</span> </p><p><span m='2413000'>The
  idea is that it has an extra pair of electrons on that</span> <span m='2418000'>nitrogen
  in the ammonia molecule, that it can share with</span> <span m='2423000'>the aluminum.
  And now we go ahead and</span> <span m='2426000'>complete the picture. And we can
  have eight electrons</span> <span m='2430000'>around everybody.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2438000'>And so the rule of eight is now satisfied for the three</span> <span
  m='2442000'>chlorines, for the aluminum, and for the nitrogen of the</span> <span
  m='2446000'>ammonia molecule. The ammonia molecule is what we</span> <span m='2450000'>call
  a "Lewis base."</span> <span m='2458000'>And the aluminum trichloride molecule is
  what we</span> <span m='2463000'>call a "Lewis acid," for reasons that should now
  be</span> <span m='2468000'>quite clear. And I want to show you how we</span> <span
  m='2472000'>can look at these things. And if you will give me just a</span> <span
  m='2477000'>second here, I am going to load the aluminum trichloride</span> <span
  m='2482000'>molecule up onto the screen.</span> </p><p><span m='2493000'>What we
  are going to do is remember that there are lots of</span> <span m='2498000'>different
  ways in which you can visualize molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2502000'>And I
  want to show you some of the more interesting ways.</span> </p><p><span m='2546000'>All
  that is is a picture of the aluminum trichloride</span> <span m='2553000'>molecule
  with spheres drawn at kind of arbitrary radii.</span> </p><p><span m='2560000'>The
  size of these spheres is not representative of any</span> <span m='2565000'>particular
  physical quantity, but we can change that.</span> </p><p><span m='2571000'>And so
  now, what we are going to do is draw the thing a</span> <span m='2576000'>slightly
  different way. And what you can see is that</span> <span m='2582000'>the positions
  of those nuclei are in this flat box.</span> </p><p><span m='2587000'>I made the
  box kind of flat. It is kind of a slab because</span> <span m='2593000'>this AlCl
  three molecule is conveniently kind of</span> <span m='2599000'>flat in its structure.
  And what are we going to do</span> <span m='2604000'>now? We are going to draw a
  contour</span> <span m='2608000'>surface. And I like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2611000'>We
  are going to use the solid surface method,</span> <span m='2614000'>first. And can
  you see that now?</span> </p><p><span m='2617000'>These curves that enclose the
  four nuclei of the aluminum</span> <span m='2621000'>trichloride molecule do have
  some physical</span> <span m='2625000'>significance, because what I have done here</span>
  <span m='2629000'>is taken results, in this case from the quantum</span> <span m='2633000'>chemistry
  calculation, but you could also take it from</span> <span m='2637000'>an X-ray crystallographic
  structure determination study.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>And I have drawn
  a three-dimensional contour map.</span> </p><p><span m='2646000'>The value of the
  electron density at every point on the</span> <span m='2651000'>surface of one of
  those ovaloid shapes is the same.</span> </p><p><span m='2654000'>Just like when
  you have a contour map to describe in two</span> <span m='2659000'>dimensions an
  interesting complicated surface,</span> <span m='2662000'>we can do this in three
  dimensions as well.</span> </p><p><span m='2667000'>And one of the things you notice,
  when you look at a</span> <span m='2670000'>surface like this, is that the value
  of the</span> <span m='2673000'>electron density actually goes down to some low
  value in</span> <span m='2677000'>between the nuclei, for this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2679000'>When you see molecules represented as balls and sticks,</span> <span
  m='2683000'>or if you represent molecules this way, just showing a pair of</span>
  <span m='2687000'>dots between the aluminum and chloride, you may not be getting</span>
  <span m='2691000'>a physically complete picture of the situation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2696000'>You can get a much more complete picture if you have</span> <span m='2699000'>access
  to the actual electron density.</span> </p><p><span m='2702000'>And then, you can
  even go a little further,</span> <span m='2706000'>and I want to show you something
  very cool.</span> </p><p><span m='2709000'>First I am going to need to load in a
  second molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2719000'>And that will be the product of
  the first "Lewis acid-base</span> <span m='2722000'>reaction" that we have discussed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2725000'>Because, I didn't say it over there, but that was your
  first</span> <span m='2729000'>exposure to a Lewis acid-base reaction, in which
  the ammonia</span> <span m='2733000'>molecule comes in and binds to the aluminum
  trichloride</span> <span m='2736000'>molecule, in order to satisfy the valence</span>
  <span m='2740000'>requirements of the respective atom types.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2744000'>And so, here we are going to look at that molecule,</span> <span m='2747000'>and
  we are going to look at its electron density.</span> </p><p><span m='2760000'>And
  I think you are going to like this very much.</span> </p><p><span m='2786000'>Here
  it comes. And then I am going to</span> <span m='2789000'>represent this as a solid
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='2793000'>The value of the electron density everywhere
  on this</span> <span m='2798000'>surface is 0.1 electron density units.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2802000'>I want you to start thinking about how that shape appears</span> <span
  m='2808000'>there because I am going to underscore that a little bit</span> <span
  m='2813000'>more in just a second. But one thing you should notice</span> <span
  m='2819000'>is that at the NH three molecule, which is pictured at</span> <span
  m='2824000'>the top of that representation, what you are seeing is that the</span>
  <span m='2830000'>value of the electron density does not get very small as you</span>
  <span m='2835000'>go between the nitrogen and hydrogen nuclei because both</span>
  <span m='2839000'>nitrogen and hydrogen are quite similar in electronegativity as</span>
  <span m='2845000'>compared with the aluminum atom in this system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2858000'>The fascinating thing about illustrating a molecule in this</span> <span
  m='2866000'>way is that we can actually associate another property with</span> <span
  m='2875000'>the color on the surface. Now what we are doing is</span> <span m='2882000'>looking
  at the aluminum trichloride ammonia system.</span> </p><p><span m='2886000'>And
  let me see if I can make this thing gradually spin,</span> <span m='2890000'>so
  that I can talk about it without being pinned to my</span> <span m='2895000'>computer.
  What we have on the surface on</span> <span m='2898000'>each of these electron density
  isosurface enclosed regions is a</span> <span m='2903000'>color that corresponds
  with a value of a function that tells</span> <span m='2908000'>us about the propensity
  of electrons to be paired at that</span> <span m='2913000'>point in space. The Lewis
  theory is now colored</span> <span m='2918000'>onto the electron density isosurface
  of this Lewis acid,</span> <span m='2922000'>Lewis base complex molecule. And the
  values that correspond</span> <span m='2927000'>to those regions in space where
  electrons are most likely to be</span> <span m='2932000'>found paired up are colored
  blue.</span> </p><p><span m='2934000'>Where they are least likely to be found paired
  up are colored</span> <span m='2939000'>kind of red-orange, here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2942000'>And then an intermediate color is this green.</span> </p><p><span m='2945000'>And
  so, you can see that you have electron pairs associated</span> <span m='2949000'>with
  each of the three NH bonds, up at the top.</span> </p><p><span m='2952000'>You have
  another electron pair here in blue,</span> <span m='2956000'>which is very proximate
  to this aluminum center,</span> <span m='2959000'>that is very electron deficient
  as we had found right over here</span> <span m='2964000'>because it lacks an octet.
  And then, each of these</span> <span m='2967000'>chlorines is able to attract electron
  pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='2972000'>Because chlorine is very electronegative,</span>
  <span m='2974000'>it attracts the electron pairs to itself and sort of withholds</span>
  <span m='2979000'>them from the aluminum center, but yet, that development of</span>
  <span m='2983000'>charge separation keeps everything together in what we</span>
  <span m='2987000'>can call an ionic interaction, an electrostatic interaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2991000'>You can see here covalent bonding, donor-acceptor complex</span>
  <span m='2995000'>formation, and electrostatic contributions to bonding.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3000000'>And all of this is just an illustration of the brilliant</span>
  <span m='3003942'>ideas of Gilbert Newton Lewis.</span> </p>
